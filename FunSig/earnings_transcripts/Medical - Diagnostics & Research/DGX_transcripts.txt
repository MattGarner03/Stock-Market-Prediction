===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any re-distribution, re-transmission or re-broadcast of this call in any form without written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Any actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Now, here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth of approximately 12%, including nearly 2.5% in organic growth as demand rebounded in March following weather impacts early in the quarter. Our growth was due to contributions from acquisitions and large enterprise accounts, demand for our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and expanded health plan access. We also continue to expand our use of automation, robotics and AI, with the goal of improving quality, customer and employee experiences and productivity. We are reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2025. Now before turning to highlights from the quarter, I'd like to briefly comment on the recent court case that vacated the FDA rule, to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. The court's decision will ensure patients and providers can continue to access innovative laboratory testing services regulated under CLIA without additional regulatory costs to comply with the FDA LDT rule. We also recognize that, several growing areas of our business already operate under the FDA's existing quality management system regulations, including companion diagnostics and lab services for clinical trials. In addition, our business is increasingly global, as we expand in Canada through LifeLabs and provide reference testing for many countries. We continue to invest in quality management processes and technologies to navigate the complexity of the global regulatory environment. Now, I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the first quarter, then Sam will provide more detail in our results. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core clinical customers, physicians and hospitals, as well as customers in the higher growth areas of consumer-initiated testing, life sciences and data analytics. We enable growth across our customer channels through faster growing advanced diagnostics in five key clinical areas, which are advanced cardiometabolic, autoimmune, brain health, oncology, and women's and reproductive health. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver and our strategy emphasizes accretive outreach purchases and independent labs. Finally, we are focused on driving operational improvements across the business with the deployment of automation, robotics and AI for improved quality, customer and employee experiences and productivity. Here are some of the updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the first quarter of 2025. In the physician channel, we delivered revenue growth in the high-teens, driven largely by acquisitions. Organic revenue growth in the physician channel was mid-single-digits. Our expanding portfolio of advanced diagnostics continued to deliver solid growth. We also generated volume and revenue growth through access to new geographies, as a result of new health plan partnerships that took effect on January 1st. In addition, we also grew from large enterprise accounts, including functional medicine providers, which are often early adopters of advanced diagnostics tests that over time move to broader adoption. For example, we saw impressive uptake of our novel PFAS, Forever Chemicals test, which we launched a little over one year ago. Our ability to scale diagnostic innovation is attractive to large enterprise organizations seeking to improve access, quality and affordability. During the quarter, Quest was named as the first independent national lab, to be selected to the Optum Health preferred lab network. The Optum Health PLN requires labs to meet rigorous quality and economic criteria to improve patient affordability and access. The Optum Health network represents more than 85,000 Optum employed, contracted and affiliated physicians. Our addition to this PLN is an example of our attractiveness, as a partner to enterprise providers seeking to improve quality and economic value. We also announced an agreement to provide comprehensive lab testing for Fresenius Medical Care's dialysis center serving more than 200,000 kidney dialysis patients in the U.S. under a separate agreement, we also plan to acquire select lab assets from Fresenius Medical Care in the U.S. In the hospital channel, revenue growth in the quarter was largely driven by contributions from our Collaborative Lab Solutions, formerly known as Professional Lab Services. Running a lab and developing lab tests requires investing in equipment, hiring specialized talent, and keeping pace with innovation in lab technology. Health systems continue to face supplies inflation, workforce challenges and reduced access to capital. Through our reference testing, Co-lab Solutions and outreach lab acquisitions, Quest provides hospitals with strategic options for accessing best-in-class diagnostic innovation without having to maintain a lab. At our recent Investor Day, we shared our plans to expand in three high growth areas: consumer initiated testing, life sciences and data analytics. We've recently enhanced the online shopping experience of our consumer-initiated test platform, questhelp.com, streamlining the order process, which contributed to a sharp uptick in first time orders during the quarter. We also introduced 10 new tests on the platform. Questhelp.com features fast access, physician consults, and for STIs and several other conditions, access to prescriptions for treatment. We've recently shared our long-term outlook for double-digits growth in advanced diagnostics across five key clinical areas. Advanced cardiometabolic and autoimmune testing both grew at double-digits rates similar to trends seen last year. These areas help providers support preventative care for patients, by identifying early health risks conventional lab tests can miss. In brain health, we generated double-digits growth from our innovative AD-Detect blood tests for Alzheimer's disease. We are particularly excited about our latest AD-Detect blood test panel, which we launched this month. This new panel combines results of amyloid beta and p-tau217, to well establish Alzheimer's biomarkers to give physicians even greater confidence to confirm Alzheimer's brain pathology in symptomatic patients. In women's and reproductive health, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing grew double-digits. In March, we launched a solution that enables a patient to self-collect a specimen for HPV cervical cancer screening at a doctor's office. We plan to roll out this self-collect option at our 2,000 patient service centers in the U.S. early next month, complementing our STI related self-collect option, which has already seen high rates of adoption since its launch last year. During the quarter, we started to receive commercial orders for our Haystack MRD test for assessing early risk of cancer recurrence. We are investing in our connectivity with electronic medical records preferred by oncologists to improve ease of account setup and ordering. For instance, we plan to deploy Haystack MRD via Epic's Aura specialty EMR module later this year. Finally, Quest continues to be at the forefront of serving public health needs. We saw an uptick in our measles offerings, including testing that can be used for diagnosis or to assess vaccination status or prior infection. Turning to operational excellence, we continue to target 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements through Invigorate. We are automating several areas of our laboratories from tuberculosis testing to cervical cancer screening to improve quality, customer and employee experiences and productivity. We also recently shared goals for Project Nova, which we expect will modernize and simplify our entire order to cash process. While this initiative will take several years to fully implement, we expect to realize the benefits sooner, including lower IT spend and improved productivity. Project Nova will also support our ability to optimize data insights and GenAI. During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Google Cloud to streamline data management and employ GenAI to personalize customer and employee experiences. Finally, I want to thank our more than 55,000 Quest and LifeLabs colleagues for their dedication to living the Quest purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And now, Sam will provide more details on our performance and 2025 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.65 billion, up 12.1% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 2.4%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 12.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting recent acquisitions as well as growth in our key physician and hospital channels. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 12.4% versus the first quarter of 2024, with organic volume down by 0.9%. During the quarter, weather and one less day versus the prior year reduced volume growth by approximately 160 basis points. Total revenue per requisition was up 0.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec, mostly offset by the impact of the LifeLabs acquisition, which carries a lower revenue per requisition. On an organic basis, revenue per rec was up 3.6% in the quarter versus last year. Unit price reimbursement was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $346 million or 13% of revenues, compared to $300 million or 12.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $406 million or 15.3% of revenues compared to $349 million or 14.8% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to the impact of recent acquisitions and organic revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of weather, one less day versus the prior year, and wage increases. Reported EPS was $1.94 in the quarter, compared to $1.72 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.21 versus $2.04 the prior year. EPS in the first quarter was impacted by higher interest expense versus the prior year. Cash from operations was $314 million in the first quarter versus $154 million in the prior year. Turning now to full year 2025 guidance. Despite the economic uncertainty and unstable macro backdrop, and given Quest's essential role in healthcare and comparative resilience, we are reaffirming guidance for revenues and adjusted EPS. Therefore, revenues are expected to be between $10.7 billion and $10.85 billion. Reported EPS is now expected to be in a range of $8.62 to $8.87 and adjusted EPS to remain in a range of $9.55 to $9.80. Cash from operations is now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million. Our 2025 guidance reflects the following considerations. Our revenue guidance continues to assume approximately 3% organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisitions completed in 2024 and announced to date. It does not assume any contribution from prospective M&A. We continue to anticipate that Haystack Oncology will be slightly less dilutive versus the prior year. We are making investments in 2025 related to Project Nova, which we expect will modernize our entire order to cash process. Also, despite the decision by a federal court to vacate the FDA rule on lab developed tests, we still intend to make some investments this year to strengthen our regulatory capabilities to serve our growing global and life sciences businesses. Operating margin is expected to expand versus the prior year. We continue to anticipate net interest expense to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%. Our share count for the full year is expected to be approximately 114 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, we raised our operating cash flow guidance by $50 million which primarily reflects a pretax gain to be taken in Q2 related to a payroll tax credit under the CARES Act that we received in April. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong consolidated and organic revenue growth in the first quarter, as demand rebounded in March following weather impacts early in the quarter. In addition to acquisitions, key drivers of growth included large enterprise partnerships, advanced diagnostics and expanded health plan access. And we are reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2025. Now, we'd be happy to take questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the organic, the volumes that you guys had. When you kind of break it down on a test per day, it's roughly flattish to what you guys had last year. And so, as you're thinking about as you roll out through the rest of the year, is the pacing going to be relatively similar to what we had last year? Anything to call out there from days or what you guys have baked in from the downside on from weather, et cetera?
Jim Davis: Yes. Good morning and thanks for your question. So, just on the organic volume, reported was down 90 basis points. But if we correct for the leap year impact and the weather impact year-over-year, it would have increased that by 160 basis points. So, we would have been up about close to 1%. Now, that really does compare with what we saw both in the third quarter and fourth quarter last year. There was a progression through 2024, but only because the first and second quarter were really still impacted by COVID from 2023. The other thing I'd mentioned is, while January and February were certainly soft because of the weather, we did see a nice bounce back, in particular during the last three weeks of March. And I would tell you, our volume trends in the first 19, 20 days of April have also been consistent with our expectations and what we saw last year. So, I think we're pleased with the utilization levels that we're seeing out there right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask the tariff question, and just try to understand sort of what kind of exposures Quest has to this. In the context of how much of your supply costs come OUS. How much of it is fixed contracts, how should we think about the risks of this going forward, have you adjusted your model or your expectations for tariffs in any way? Any details you can provide would be super helpful.
Jim Davis: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just start with, look, we buy about $2 billion of reagents, supplies, and that $2 billion is capital, equipment cost and also service contracts, so about $2 billion of total spend. Now, first of all, less than 1% of that we source directly from China ourselves, okay. And we have plans already activated, where that less than 1% small number, we are moving some of those and by the way, that less than 1% is pre-analytical supplies, gowns, gloves, masks, tubes, really simple types of things. So, some of it we've already moved. We're in the process of moving others. So, we actually think our exposure there is not that great. Now, if you come back to that $2 billion, about 75% to 80% of that spend is really reagents and supplies for the laboratory. And that is actually manufactured here in the U.S. So, we can have global suppliers like Siemens and Roche, but the manufacturing of that is in the U.S. So again, we believe our exposure is small. The other thing I'd say is, most of our supplies are under multiyear contracts. Obviously, those contracts come up every four to five years. So 20% will come up this year, but we compete those things. So as we said in the prepared remarks, any tariff impact we think we can cover at this point, given the guidance that we've put out there.
Sam Samad: Yes. And I would just add, Kevin, this is obviously based on under current law and current regulations. So, this is what we're assuming based on today, what we know today, the impact is not zero, but the impact is very manageable for us, and it's baked into our current guidance.
Kevin Caliendo: That's super helpful. I appreciate the color. Can I ask a quick follow-up? Just in the last week or so, we've read some stories about strikes up in LifeLabs. The stories don't give a ton of details. It sounds like it's somewhat organized, but non-union. Can you just maybe talk about what that is, and if it's impacting LifeLabs in any way or impacting the potential accretion from LifeLabs?
Jim Davis: Yes, sure, Kevin. So first of all, the strike is just on the British Columbia side. Recall LifeLabs broadly participates in the Ontario marketplace and the British Columbia marketplace. British Columbia is actually the smaller of the two sides. There are about 1,200 employees that are involved in the strike. Those 1,200 employees are part of a much bigger union of roughly 70,000 employees called the BCGEU. It's largely a public service union. Now, there are certain statutes about how strikes are conducted in British Columbia. And one of those is, you can only -- we have 128 patient service centers in British Columbia. You can actually only strike at 17 of those 128. So on any given day, actually there's a small amount of people that are actually out on strike and our management team in British Columbia has to backfill those open positions, which they've been doing. We do have a mediator involved. We are making progress and we hope to have things settled within the next 30 to 45 days.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe just a quick one, just on pacing on margins. Can you talk a little bit about 2Q? I know typically seasonally that's the strongest quarter, so just want to talk through margins and earnings there. Any impact again from some of the tariff noise, freight surcharges, things like that? And then just quickly LifeLabs, outside the strike, just how it performed this year or in the quarter would be helpful.
Sam Samad: Sure, and good morning, Patrick. Listen, let's talk first about margins in Q1 and then I'll talk about the pacing and address your question about LifeLabs. Q1 margins came in operating margins at 15.3%, so a 50 basis point expansion from prior year. That was driven by volume, impacted somewhat negatively by the weather impacts that we talked about, which were more severe than what we saw last year. But in general, strong margins, 15.3% operating margins. As we think about the full year, Patrick, the pacing is really very consistent with what we expect to see in terms of traditional or historic seasonality, even going back pre-COVID seasonality, because COVID impacted a little bit the seasonality. So traditionally, what we've seen, and I'm talking really here EPS pacing, not necessarily operating margin pacing. But EPS pacing, usually what we see is roughly 49% in the first half of the year, about 51% in the second half of the year. And so, you see Q2 being the best quarter, Q3 slightly lower than that, Q4 lower than Q3 and then usually Q1 is actually the lowest quarter of the year in terms of EPS contribution. So that's what we expect in terms of pacing. In terms of expectation for full year 2025, still the expectation is that, we continue -- that we grow operating margins rate versus last year, both dollars and rate. In terms of LifeLabs?
Jim Davis: Yes, let me just give you a little color on LifeLabs in the quarter. First of all, I think as you all know, most of the revenue is capitated. So there's generally not surprises on the revenue side. There's a small amount of patient. It's patient physician revenue where you're selling tests directly to physicians, outside of the capitated agreement. But the revenue was really basically in line with our expectations. On the margin side, as we indicated, we expect to have LifeLabs at the corporate average within two to three years. And I would just tell you, we made again nice progress in the quarter. We've seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in margin rate, and we expect to be, if anything, on the early side of our plans of having it, at the company corporate margin in two to three years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Are tariffs or any of the potential hospital reimbursement challenges, creating an opportunity in the hospital lab management space or outreach space or you would just say sort of too soon? If you could just sort of talk about the maybe the progression of some of those questions and debates that you've been hearing recently?
Jim Davis: Yes. I think it's a bit too soon. It's not to say, we won't contemplate price increases, if tariffs start to hit us in a meaningful way. As you know, the health plan contracts probably don't give us a chance to go back and open those up. Having said that, 20% to 25% of the contracts come up every year. And if we're seeing a meaningful impact on our business, we're certainly going to try to pass that through. The health system pricing landscape, I would still say is the most challenging of all that we deal with. But again, if we are hit in a meaningful way, we're certainly going to try to pass that along to both health systems, client bill, consumer bill and anything outside of health plans.
Elizabeth Anderson: Sorry, Jim. I meant more like our hospitals like increasingly seeking relations like in your acquisition strategy. Sorry, if my question wasn't clear.
Jim Davis: Okay. The funnel of opportunities on what we now call our Co-Lab, collaborative lab services agreement continues to be very robust. We're in the process of negotiating with several institutions on this. So, if anything, you're right, it can accelerate those opportunities, if suppliers start to pass those tariffs in the form of price increases to our health systems.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners.
Michael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe to kind of get at the market dynamics in a little different fashion. I appreciate the color you gave on the tariff impact. That's certainly helpful. I would assume that, other entities in the market, smaller than you and your largest peer are going to be in slightly more challenging position in trying to get to, managing any offsets on costs similar to potentially what happened with the inflationary environment on the wage side from a couple of years back. How do you think about strategic discussions you're having with payers on potentially driving more share about opportunities you have to service a wider swath of their membership bases, given your reach, your scale and your ability to absorb and/or offset any of these cost dynamics? Curious, I know it's early, but if you're seeing any changes in terms of strategic payer dynamic and then looking to you more closely given you're on much more stable financial footing?
Sam Samad: Yes. So, Mike, I would tell you that, our discussions and collaborations with the health plans are ongoing, continuous. As you know, we have all sorts of programs in place on the redirection of work to try to redirect work from expensive out-of-network labs, from expensive health system labs. Several of our large payers, we have collaborative relationships. They provide us with information of physicians, that are using these very expensive labs and our teams go and work those lists really hard and try to convert that over. As we also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are now a preferred lab network provider for Optum Health services, and that went into place during the quarter. And in a similar way, we work with the roughly 85,000 physicians that are in the Optum network. We work with the management team at Optum Health to try to redirect as much of that work into labs, to Quest Diagnostics, where you're going to get really great quality, at a great value. So if anything, yes, I agree these tariffs may push probe and help do that and move that work even quicker.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Hi, good morning guys. A follow-up to Kevin's question on the tariffs and I think I missed one of the numbers that you gave out. Of the $2 billion spend, what's the spend on supplies on the sort of low-end that could be sourced in China like syringes, gloves and gowns?
Jim Davis: What we did -- I didn't give that exact number. The number I gave is of the $2 billion, less than 1% is sourced directly from suppliers in China by Quest Diagnostics. And within that less than 1% are mostly pre-analytical supplies, so gallons, gloves. Now, that's not to say that the entirety of our pre-analytical low tech supplies comes out of China. They come across in all parts of the world. Now what I said is to minimize our exposure on that spend in China, we've actively been moving from suppliers in China to outside of China, including suppliers in the U.S., including suppliers around the rest of the globe, where tariffs are significantly lower.
Sam Samad: Yes. A couple of percentages though, Pito, just to keep in mind is, we also said, roughly 80% is basically manufactured or sourced in the U.S. So at least based on the law today, not impacted by tariffs. And also 70% to 80% of the total supplies that we have are under contract. So they have fixed pricing and we think we can manage the exposure. The exposure is not zero, but we think it's manageable.
Jim Davis: Yes. Just to clarify, the 80% that is manufactured in the U.S. are really the reagents, the expensive reagents for running the lab test.
Pito Chickering: So, of the $2 billion or 20% of the price source out inside the U.S., a combination of obviously split between Malaysia, China or a series of other sources, I'd just sort of think about that, right?
Jim Davis: That's about right.
Pito Chickering: Okay, fair enough. And then for your M&A pipeline, just can you sort of talk about sort of how the pipeline looks? It's just been a while since we haven't seen the deal close in a quarter, going back in the cash flow statement since fourth quarter 2023. Does the pipeline for how we still look as robust as it has been? Do you sort of see the pace continuing as expected or as hospitals continue to do well operationally, excluding the current political environment, do you see that change the pace of as you do outreach deals?
Sam Samad: Yes. The funnel is still healthy and it's a mix of hospital outreach types of endeavors plus small regional labs that are still left out there. So I think it's healthy. We did, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, enter into a collaboration with Fresenius Medical Services, where we are now going to start doing the lab testing associated with dialysis treatment in our regional labs. In addition, Fresenius also provided third-party laboratory testing services for other dialysis centers and we purchased that small book of business and that too will come into Quest Diagnostics. So that represents, as I mentioned, over 200,000 dialysis patients, patients getting tested at least once a month and that represents a nice chunk of volume that will be coming our way, when we officially close on this later in this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies.
Noah Kava: This is Noah on for Tycho. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask about Haystack particularly and how you're receiving commercial orders, how you're thinking about reimbursement submissions and timelines? And then on the data side, anything you think needs to be done to generate more evidence?
Jim Davis: Yes. So, as we discussed in the remarks, we launched the Haystack assay commercially in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress that we've made. We had over 75 customers that were part of the early experience program and many of those customers are continuing to do business with Quest Diagnostics. In terms of reimbursement, the test is being offered to Medicare and patients in commercial plans and we offer to any patient. We've just started to submit for reimbursement. We're working with one of the big Macs on getting the coding and coverage policies in place. And that requires a bit of time and it requires a bit of reimbursement experience and that experience is well underway.
Sam Samad: And in terms of evidence, stay tuned. We'll continue to work on potential evidence, as we move forward here.
Jim Davis: Yes. You'll see more and more publications and the fruits of the ongoing clinical trials that Haystack had in place even before we purchased them well more than a year ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you very much. So I just wanted to, on the collaboration with Google Cloud to streamline data management and you generate GenAI to personalize customer experience and employee experiences. How does that translate into some of the financial benefits? I was thinking about maybe the personalized customer one, maybe you get higher compliance rate and testing or something like that? And does the employee one lead to maybe some benefits from the cost side? What kind of specific KPIs should we be looking at to measure success in here this second?
Sam Samad: So step one in the overall relationship with Google Cloud is simply the movement of what I call pockets that reside in a lot of various places across Quest Diagnostics, mostly on premise. So, the benefits of moving that information to the cloud, I'll give you a couple. One, we have a data analytics business and whenever we have to search the entire Quest database, it's a complex task today to basically conduct searches across data that's sitting in pockets all across the country in various places. So, it's really going to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our data analytics business. That business is primarily serving pharmaceutical companies, CROs. It serves the health plans and it's really going to make that business more efficient, more effective and will lead to greater growth. In terms of some of the benefits for employees, for customers, our employees that are constantly searching databases to get information for patients, to get information for physicians, it'll speed up those searches. At some point, we're going to allow AI-based chat services for physicians and patients to get the information that they need. And honestly, at some point, look, patients and physicians, we have a test menu of over 4,500 tests. If you think every physician knows exactly what test to order at what specific time, for what specific condition they're seeing, it's just beyond the capability of many, many physicians. So having those types of GenAI interactive tools that allow patients and physicians to query our test menu and understand, what is the best type of vitamin D test to order, what is the best type of testosterone test to order, is really going to make their lives easier, faster, simpler and actually get the best information into their hands. So those are some of the quick, easy things that we're anticipating with this, but it all starts with having our data in one location, easy-to-access, streamlined, efficient and leading to higher quality answers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I got just one. I'll roll everything together. Just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts on other policy regulatory updates from D.C. that could happen this year, especially anything on PAMA, SALSA, just what your latest thoughts are on that. And then sort of tying into that, some concern about potential cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, just how should we think about that potential risk of the business?
Jim Davis: Yes. So let's start with the cuts on Medicare, Medicaid. At this point, if anything, the Medicare Advantage plans just got a nice rate increase. So we are pleased with that and that should certainly help in our discussions with Medicare Advantage Plans around the country. There's a lot being written around Medicaid potential cuts. There's a lot being written around exchange, the ACA exchange related. But at this point, those bills are moving through the House and Senate. There's a reconciliation process. So I think it's too early to tell. What I would tell you is, Medicaid and managed Medicaid collectively, it's about 8% of our entire business. So it's certainly not the biggest portion of what we do, but we're watching it closely. If anything, I would say there appears to be support of the exchange plan, the ACA plan that's actually in place today. So we feel optimistic about that. In terms of other regulatory things going on in D.C., again, firstly, we're pleased with the outcome of the lawsuit on LDT regulation, very pleased with that outcome. As we said in the prepared remarks, we still have elements of our business that are FDA-regulated, including our work around companion diagnostics, our clinical lab work that we do for pharmaceutical companies with patients that are in clinical trials, all of that still remains in a regulated type of environment. In terms of PAMA and PAMA reform, so now that we have the FDA LDT issue behind us, I would tell you, the most important thing for our trade association, ACWA, and for ourselves to work from a regulatory standpoint is PAMA reform. As you know, we have a new Congress, which means and you have a new majority position in the House. So we are working with -- our trade association is actively working with the three committees that really set healthcare policy, the House -- and Means Committee, House Energy and Commerce, Senate Finance Committee. There I would tell you, there's broad bipartisan support to actually get something done this year in terms of PAMA reform. So now if it looks like if we're moving into the back half of the year and we don't see progress, we'll certainly push for another delay, a delay in the cuts that were anticipated six years ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.
Andrew Brackmann: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe another one just on the macro side of things. There's been some discussion around the potential for a recession later this year. So as you sort of think about the business, how it's set up today to withstand any demand pressures from unemployment rates going higher, how does that sort of -- how has it changed over the last handful of years and how might a recessionary demand sort of shocks be different today versus say '08 , '09?
Jim Davis: Yes. So good question. And the first thing I ask to keep in mind is, look, it's important to remember, patients access the healthcare system and they need access to affordable lab testing in any environment, okay, whether the economy is booming or the economy is in a recession. We provide really essential services that are needed for both providers and for patients. Now, it's not to say, we're recession proof. If you go back to the Great Recession of 2009, 2010, we did see a modest impact on our volumes. In 2009, it was about a 70 basis point reduction. And in 2010, it was a little bit bigger, about 1%. Remember, when people get laid off, generally they have benefits that continue or cover benefits that provide coverage. So, there is a layer of insurance for some period of time for most people that lose their jobs. So while we're not recession proof, we believe healthcare services in particular diagnostic lab testing are still really essential for the health and well-being of all human beings.
Sam Samad: Yes. Andrew, I would add a couple of things as well to Jim's comments. One, everything that Jim said, but there's also more safety nets today than there were back in 2009. You've got the Affordable Care Act. So people have in general some more coverage or backup coverage in terms of what's out there through the ACA. And even if we look back at the last Great Recession, patient collection rates held fairly steady. Obviously, we'll monitor those. We'll make sure that, we maintain our patient assistance programs and all that. But patient concession rates did not really spike up materially back in 2009.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: Good morning, guys. Just had a couple of follow-ups. The first was, I don't think I heard it earlier, just what was the final impact from weather when you take what you experienced in January and February and talked about the Analyst Day? That's question number one. And then question number two, just, Sam, last quarter you provided some helpful commentary around EPS cadence. I was just curious, if you still think that's a good way to think about how the guidance is set up for the year?
Jim Davis: Sure. Yes, I'll take the first one, Jack. In terms of weather, we said on a year-over-year basis point, a year-over-year basis, it was a 50 impact in terms of volume. We said the one less day, the leap year was worth 110 basis points, so 160 altogether. Now, yes, at our Investor Day, we suggested our revenue would be lighter in the quarter. Remember, that was at the beginning of March, we prepared those things. The first week of March, our actual volume, and it was some weather during that first week of March was actually light. But we saw a really strong recovery in the last three weeks of March, which we mentioned has continued into April, the first 19, 20 days of April. Our volume trends have been in line with what we were seeing in Q3 and Q4 of last year.
Sam Samad: Yes, for sure. And Jack, remember the 0.5% of weather is a year-over-year impact. So it's incremental to what we saw in last year as an impact on growth. And from an EPS perspective, the seasonality is I think consistent with what we've talked about in the past in terms of traditional seasonality. So EPS in Q2 being the highest quarter, Q3 is a slight step down, Q4 is a step down from that, but second lowest quarter of the year in terms of EPS cadence. And then, Q1 is usually the lowest EPS that we get. So Q1 is the lowest quarter of the year. So that type of seasonality I think is still realistic to assume.
Operator: Our last question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. So you mentioned continuing investments that you're making that I guess that would offset or what would have been kind of the LDT rule. I guess what are those in terms of what you're making there and what's incremental relative to what you were thinking previously? You also mentioned labor expenses, like, has anything changed on that front, in terms of what you're seeing or your expectations there? And then, just more broadly speaking around kind of expenses, I guess, can you speak to some of the offsetting factors or levers you have from here in response to whether it's inflationary pressures like labor costs or any direct, indirect impacts kind of from tariffs that you were mentioning before? Thanks.
Jim Davis: All right. So let me comment first on the investments from an FDA perspective and then I'll have Sam make some comments on the labor outlook and inflation. So as we said at Investor Day, we expected to spend about $10 million of incremental cost investment to prepare for the FDA LDT rule. Now that was really centered on two things that the FDA asked us to have in place for year one. One was the build out of a complaint handling unit, and two was enabling the output of that complaint handling unit, which is the analysis of complaints that potentially turn into MDRs, medical device reports and to have that the ability to exchange information with the FDA in an electronic means. Now, we're not going to spend $0 and we're likely not to spend $10 million this year. However, as I mentioned, we have a growing companion diagnostics business. We have a life sciences business that does clinical trial work for both supporting CROs and supporting pharmaceutical companies. And we take in reference testing from close to 40 countries around the world, all which operate in various ISO frameworks that require some type of regulatory framework. So we still have some infrastructure needs to be put in place. We still actually do need to have a complaint handling unit. It may not need 40 resources. It may need something much smaller than that, to support the other elements of our business that again are growing and operate under FDA regulation today. So again, the answer is not zero, the answer is not 10, somewhere in between that, but we expect to continue to improve the regulatory and quality organization that we have in place here at Quest today. Sam?
Sam Samad: Yes. And just in general on expenses, so let me break it down into three things. Labor, first of all, which is a big piece, our expectation is still somewhere in the 3% to 4% in terms of wage inflation this year. In terms of retention or turnover, turnover is now somewhere in the mid to high teens. So an improvement definitely versus where we ended 2024, which was around 19% or so, approximately 19%. I would say, we're approaching pre-pandemic rates in terms of turnover, which was somewhere around 14%-ish. So we're making good progress there. Turnover is definitely improving, which improves productivity, which improves our expenses as well, and impacts potentially wage inflation. SG&A, we continue to drive leverage on SG&A. And you talked about some of the areas that we focus on in terms of managing expenses actively. SG&A is one of them. Our goal is to not grow SG&A more than half of the rate of growth of revenues at most. I would say, that's our target and that's our focus. And then finally and really importantly, Invigorate as a whole, which is to offset the impacts of inflation, wage inflation, any other major cost drivers in our business is to offset them through Invigorate of approximately 3% productivity and cost improvement. And I would say, we're on track and we've got that target this year and we're executing towards it.
Jim Davis: Operator, any more questions in the queue?
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to your speakers.
Jim Davis: Okay. Thanks again for joining our call today and we certainly appreciate your continued support and have a great day everyone.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and the question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics, with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics, is strictly prohibited. I’d now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Now, here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered impressive revenue growth of nearly 15%, including approximately 5% organic growth, while also improving our profitability. For the full year, we drove revenue growth of close to 7%, including approximately 3% organic growth. In 2024, our team completed eight acquisitions, including LifeLabs in Canada and four hospital outreach lab businesses in the US. We also expanded our Advanced Diagnostics menu and drove sustained double-digit growth in several clinical areas during the year. In addition, we attracted new business across the physician, hospital, and consumer channels, while also forming new relationships with health plans to extend our geographic reach. Our investments in automation in AI delivered improvements in quality, customer experience, and productivity during the quarter and throughout all of 2024, which helped us deliver on our annual 3% Invigorate savings and productivity targets. We also meaningfully improved employee retention as we strengthened our position as employer of choice. This morning, we provided guidance for 2025 that reflects our confidence in the core strength of our business, continuing robust utilization, and the momentum from acquisitions we completed in 2024. These dynamics position us favorably to accelerate revenue and earnings growth in 2025. Now, I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2025. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through Advanced Diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health, advanced cardiometabolic, and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter of 2024. Please note that my following comments are focused primarily on our US operations. In physician lab services, we delivered high single-digit revenue growth, driven primarily by strong organic growth and contributions from acquisitions in the US. As a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in the physician offices. Last month, we closed our acquisition of the outreach lab business of University Hospitals in Ohio, and completed the transition of the business in January. We expect to moderate our pace of acquisitions in 2025 as we focus on driving growth from productivity from transactions completed last year. In addition to acquisitions, other growth drivers in the quarter included new customer wins, as well as growth among large physician groups and community health centers. We also saw a step-up in functional medicine testing as more people take an interest in prevention and wellness. In the fourth quarter and full year, we benefited from robust utilization compared to historical rates. We also continue to see strong volume and revenue growth from Medicare Advantage plans, which value our high-quality, low-cost testing for their narrow networks. We are well positioned to benefit from these dynamics as we expand access through our health plan partnerships with Elevance Health and Sentara Health Plans, both of which took effect on January 1st. Today, we have access to more than 90% of the in-network lives in the US. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues nearly 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to solid continued demand for reference testing, complemented by growth in professional lab services. Hospitals continue to order a greater range of reference tests from our expanding Advanced Diagnostics menu rather than performing these tests in their own labs. By referring testing to us, hospitals are freed from the pressures that come from performing specialized tests in-house, such as hiring skilled lab personnel and investing in expensive lab testing equipment. In professional lab services, we completed three collaborations with health systems in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We expect to see modest contribution from these relationships in early 2025. Looking at 2025, we expect hospitals to continue to struggle with high wage and supply inflation, constrained access to capital, and keeping up to date with laboratory innovation. At the same time, patients and payers want greater value from lab services. Hospitals increasingly recognize that Quest can improve access to innovative and cost-efficient lab services through reference testing, lab management, and outreach lab acquisitions. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com grew total revenues nearly 50% in the fourth quarter, and approximately 40% for the full year to just over $60 million. Together with revenue from our channel partners, consumer-initiated testing revenues grew to nearly $100 million in 2024. During the year, we also greatly expanded our Questhealth.com offering to include 135 different tests to provide a comprehensive platform for serving today's increasingly health-minded consumers. In Advanced Diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including in brain health, advanced cardiometabolic, autoimmune, and women's health. We generated strong growth in brain health, largely due to impressive demand for AD-detect blood tests for assessing Alzheimer's disease risk. We will continue to explore opportunities to extend our portfolio with new biomarkers that can help providers better assess Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. We also generated strong growth in areas of advanced cardiometabolic and autoimmune testing, and we expect these patterns to continue in 2025. Our growth in women's health was driven largely by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing. We were also pleased to see strong adoption of our self-collection option for testing of genital tract infections during the quarter. In molecular genomics and oncology, we spent much of last year developing and validating our Haystack MRD blood test to aid in the early detection of minimal residual disease from solid tumor cancers. We also engaged with approximately 75 leading academic health systems and community oncology centers in our Haystack MRD Early Experience program, and are pleased with the favorable feedback we received. We are now transitioning these organizations to a commercial program and are focused on expanding utilization among medical oncologists. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are some examples of how we're improving operations. We pilot many of our automation and AI solutions at our laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. During the fourth quarter, we developed and implemented a proprietary system in Clifton that automates labeling and test tube preparation for tuberculosis testing, eliminating manual intervention and improving quality. In addition, we began testing an automated accessioning solution that speeds requisition processing. Also, in Clifton, we deployed a third-party AI solution that enhances parasitology screening by flagging likely positive specimens requiring closer human examination. We plan to roll out these solutions to our other labs later in 2025. Improving workforce engagement remains a major priority, and I'm pleased that our retention rates significantly improved across multiple job categories in 2024. Now, before I turn it over to Sam, I want to thank our more than 55,000 Quest and LifeLabs colleagues for delivering on our business imperatives last year. This amazing group of people is the engine behind our growth and the reason we entered 2025 strong, energized, and ready to deliver on our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And now, Sam will provide more details on our performance and 2025 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.62 billion, up 14.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 15.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting the contributions from recent acquisitions, including LifeLabs, as well as growth in our key physician and hospital channels. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 13.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, with organic volume growing by 0.6%. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume by approximately 50 basis points. Total revenue per requisition was up 0.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, mostly offset by the impact of the LifeLabs acquisition, which carries a lower revenue per requisition. On an organic basis, revenue per rec was up 3.3% in the quarter versus last year. Unit price reimbursement was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $361 million or 13.8% of revenues compared to $267 million or 11.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $409 million or 15.6% of revenues compared to $338 million or 14.8% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather, wage increases, and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather on operating margin to be approximately 30 basis points. Reported EPS was $1.95 in the quarter compared to $1.70 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2 23 versus $2.15 the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was impacted by higher interest expense and the higher tax rate versus the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather to be approximately $0.06 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $1.33 billion in the full year 2024 versus $1.27 billion in the prior year. Turning now to our full-year 2025 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $10.7 billion and $10.85 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.34 to $8.59, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.55 to $9.80. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.45 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million. We have posted a presentation on the investor relations page of our website that includes an adjusted EPS bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2024 adjusted EPS to the 2025 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2025 guidance reflects the following considerations. Our revenue guidance assumes approximately 3% organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisitions closed in 2024. It does not assume any contribution from prospective M&A that could be completed in 2025. As you know, we absorbed the headwind last year related to the CrowdStrike IT outage, which we do not assume repeats in 2025. We expect to begin generating revenue from the launch of our Haystack MRD test in 2025, and continue to anticipate that Haystack oncology will be slightly less dilutive versus the prior year. We are making investments in 2025 to modernize our IT infrastructure, as well as to comply with FDA regulations of laboratory-developed tests that are scheduled to begin later this year. Operating margin is expected to expand versus the prior year. We anticipate net interest expense to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, and our average share count for the full year is expected to be approximately 114 million diluted shares outstanding. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong consolidated and organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. We expanded our presence in important new geographies, including Canada through eight acquisitions and new health plan relationships. Our innovations and Advanced Diagnostics drove meaningful growth, and Haystack MRD strengthens our position in molecular genomics and oncology. Given these business strengths and robust utilization, we expect to accelerate revenue and earnings growth this year. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open, sir.
Kevin Caliendo: Oh, thank you, and thanks for getting me in so early. Appreciate it. Just a question on guidance and some of the assumptions that are in there. I appreciate the earnings bridge. I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit is there's $20 million of additional investment spend for LDT and IT. Are there any other one-timers in there? And specifically, do you expect core margins, not sort of comping out some of the other things that have happened, but you said margins expect to expand, does the guidance assume that just - that core margins will expand ex all of the sort of one-timers that we had from last year, or the accretion from deals and things happening? I want to understand that in weather, if there's any weather built in from 1Q, whether it's the fires or the frozen tundra that we had to deal with. Very long one question, but thanks.
Sam Samad: Yes, thanks, Kevin. This is Sam, and good morning. Let me just give some comments on guidance to address your question. First of all, the one-timers that you're asking about, they're all laid out in the bridge that we've included. There are no additional one-timers that you should be adding in or taking out. The key things I think from a positive standpoint that we talked about in addition to the organic revenue growth and the M&A contribution, is a benefit related to CrowdStrike, which obviously we don't expect to repeat in 2025. We've got some benefits in terms of the Haystack reduced dilution, so some benefit year-over-year. But then from an offset in terms of headwinds, we talked about the investments and we can share some more comments on that, and it really relates to the FDA LDT compliance investments to get us in compliance with that and to build up our regulatory capabilities, in addition to some investments in terms of modernizing our systems and our IT systems and the lab information systems. And we can talk some more about that. Interest expense, we've talked about the fact that we had to fund the acquisitions that we took on, especially LifeLabs. That represents a $0.50 headwind. And then there are some other headwinds that are laid out there. In terms of weather, we have not built any specific explicit assumption related to worse weather as a result of what we're seeing. But obviously, we’re monitoring Q1 and January closely because there have been some higher-than-expected weather disruptions, specifically the wildfires in California, specifically the freeze in the south and some of the snow that we've seen, also some lower temperatures in the Northeast and snow as well. So, there are some of these. In terms of operating margin, we are expecting operating margin expansion in terms of what we report, you don't have to normalize or make adjustments to get to expanded operating margins. We are expecting that our operating margin percentage, which finished at 15.6% in 2024, will expand in 2026, or in 2025, I should say.
Jim Davis: Yes. Hey, Kevin, let me just provide a little more color on the investment. So, as Sam said, there's two parts to it. One is in preparation for the FDA requirements. Now, the first set of requirements go into effect on May the 6th this year. And notably, we have to stand up a complaint handling unit and enable ourselves to report any, what we call medical device reporting to the FDA. So, that does require some investment. It requires some additional resources to do that. So, in part that is what some of those investments are used for. The second and more substantial piece is, look, as you all know, this is a digital enterprise that we operate today, from order intake to our logistics systems, to how we operate the labs, to how we provide results through our MyQuest application, and our entire billing system. We think about that as our entire order to cash spectrum of systems. And while we have been making investments from time to time, we need to make some more substantial investments this year and next year. And the benefits from those investments are certainly going to help us improve operations and improve the entire customer experience. So, we're modernizing this IT infrastructure. We're going to migrate some of our current systems into cloud-based systems. And over time, that's going to dramatically reduce the complexity. It's going to create more efficiencies between our labs, and it's really, really going to improve the overall customer experience. Ultimately, it's going to lower our IT costs, and there's going to be a good ROI on these investments. We're going to lay this out more at our Investor Day on March 19th, but that's really what that $0.20 is being used for.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Donnelley of Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelley: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you to start. Just helpful to hear you talk about the margin expansion this year overall. Can you just talk about the cadence, anything to call out as the year progresses? I know LifeLabs is starting lower margin. It's heading to corporate average at some point. So, maybe just talk through that. Would be helpful. And then, Jim, just quickly on utilization, obviously been elevated here. What have you seen as you exited 4Q into this year? And just the assumptions on utilization as we work our way through 2025. Thank you, guys.
Sam Samad: Yes, thanks Patrick. So, on margin, so yes, again, let me reiterate, we are expecting margin expansion this year versus 2024. I think the components that you see in the bridge that we laid out in the guidance, organic revenue growth, approximately 3% at the midpoint. That's basically assumed at a contribution margin that comes in at roughly about 40%. Then you have the acquired revenue growth, which is roughly, let's call it $0.70 at the midpoint, is basically a combination of LifeLabs, which is the more significant piece because of the fact that we have three quarters in 2025 that we didn't have in 2024, or at least the better part of three quarters. And that will come at a margin rate, which is in the lower double digits or in the low double digits, I should say, so below our corporate average. I think you mentioned it and you're right. LifeLabs will start at a margin rate which is low double digits. Will ramp up over two to three years to get to our corporate average. But this year it will be lower and it's a bit of a drag on the margin rate. But in terms of the other acquisitions, they come in at somewhere in the 35% to 40% contribution margin. So, all in that, acquired revenue growth is probably coming in at the high teens in terms of contribution margin. Now, you asked about the cadence and I won't talk about margin rate, although it is a bit of a proxy in terms of how EPS will come in, but I think the best way to talk about cycling is really go back to our pre-COVID averages in terms of what the cycling was by quarter. And I'll just mention these just as a comparative point. It doesn't necessarily mean that our cycling is going to be exactly that in 2025, but it's a good proxy and it's a good proxy for how margin rate also will be across the quarters. But in terms of contribution from EPS, I would say roughly 22.5% is what we used to see pre-COVID in the first quarter, 26.5% in the second, 26% in the third, and or approximately 25% in the fourth. Now, again, I'm not telling you this is what our cycling is in 2025, but it's directional and it's a good proxy for what you would expect close to cycling to be in 2025. So, that's what we used to see pre-COVID.
Jim Davis: Yes, and then your question on utilization. Look, we're pleased with the utilization coming out of the fourth quarter. We look at it in many ways and across many segments. In terms of overall rec volume, we did have a slight weather impact in the quarter because of the hurricane early in Q4, so that cost us probably 50 basis points. And then we've been getting out of certain capitated business arrangements in California that were impacting just business we weren't making money on. So, we walked away from that, and that cost us a little volume. But when we look at the volume in our core physician and hospital segment, the rec volume from those segments was very, very strong in the quarter. Now, as Sam also mentioned, our rev per rec organically ex LifeLabs was up 3.3% in the quarter. And as you know, there's a lot of things that go into that rev per rec calculation. The first thing we look at is price per test. That was relatively flat in the quarter, but the second and biggest driver of that rev rec increase is test per rec. And that was probably two thirds of the increase in the overall organic rev per rec in the quarter. And so, that's utilization as well. And what's driving it is some of the new tests that we've rolled out, the brain health AB 42/40 in the tau markers, our advanced cardiometabolic testing, we're seeing big increases in things Lp(a) and ApoB. Our autoimmune testing has been really propelling some of the tests per rec growth. And then finally, I'd mention, we're seeing a nice uptick in volume from what we call functional health types of physicians. And as you probably know, they look at a lot of things and a lot of hormone testing and things like that. So, the trends on test per rec, the trends on volume in our core physician and hospital segment remain very, very strong.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open, sir.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe if I can just pull a little bit that thread there on rev per rec, it's obviously a really strong year over the course of 2024. As you think about that dynamic heading into 2025 and beyond, how much of the continued technological advancements are the drivers of this versus payer arrangements and marketing, and how should we think about this in terms of a long-term trajectory?
Jim Davis: Okay, so again, let's fast forward into 2025. We'll start with price, price per test. At this point in the year, it could probably swing between plus or minus 30 basis points, okay? There's still lots of contracts to negotiate as we go through the year. And the one segment that has been experiencing some price pressure is the hospital segment, in particular reference testing. I think we've indicated on the past calls, during the entire COVID period from 2020 through 2023, hospitals really didn't go out to RFP for reference testing providers, right? They weren't so busy with other things. So, we're seeing an uptick in RFPs, and there's still price pressure in that segment. So, on par though, look, we think it's, again, within a range of plus or minus 25 to 30 basis points. The test per rec, we expect it to continue. We’re still at the very early stages. So, when I talk about incredible test growth on things like ApoB and Lp(a) and the brain health portfolio, the overall volume of these tests is still relatively low. So, we still think there's significant growth in these segments left. Autoimmune disorders is another one. We're just seeing skyrocketing autoimmune disorders across the country. So, we expect those trends to continue. The last thing that goes into it is payer mix. And I didn't mention, but in the fourth quarter, and we saw it all last year, our mix of Medicare, Medicare Advantage, that segment of our business has been growing faster than the rest of the business. And so, that is actually good business mix because they're generally heavier recs. They're more frequent res. And as you know, many Medicare beneficiaries have comorbidities that just lead to more testing. So, all of that is pretty favorable.
Sam Samad: Maybe I can add just a couple of comments, Mike, from a financial standpoint. In terms of, if you look at the rev per rec, in Q4 it was up 3.3% organically. If you break that down between the components that Jim talked about, two thirds of that is really a benefit from test per rec, which has been increasing continuously over the last number of quarters. And then the other third benefit is really a combination of payer mix and test mix, test mix being some of the innovations that we have. Payer mix is just driven off of reimbursement and which payers were getting the contribution from the different payers. As we look towards 2025 or this year, test per rec will continue to improve, although our expectation is that it will slow in terms of the improvement. So, that improvement, we don't expect it to be at the same pace that we've seen. I mean, we have been increasing quite substantially over a number of quarters. And I wouldn't say we've peaked, but definitely that rate of improvement is not going to be at the same rate. So, that's the only other comment that I would provide with regards to rev rec expectation in 2025.
Operator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Joanna Zhou: Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joanna for Elizabeth. Maybe go back to that $0.20 IT investment for 2025. I think you guys said it is most related to the LDT regulation. Is that expected to be a one-time investment or should we kind of expect to repeat in 2026 and beyond? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes. First we said on the $0.20, the majority of it will be on modernizing our IT infrastructure, but there is a portion in there that is for FDA readiness. Now, it’s difficult to tell what the future will be for that. As you know, there's a lawsuit in front of the courts right now that ACLA and other trade associations brought, and there'll be oral hearings on that lawsuit on February 19th. And we expect the case to likely be settled by the end of the first quarter or early second quarter. So, depending on the outcome of that, if the outcome supports the FDA position, then yes, there'll be some continued investments. If the outcome favors our trade association, then those investments could certainly moderate. Now, remember outside of what we're doing on the core clinical business to get ready, we do have segments in Quest Diagnostics that already operate under 21 CFR Part A 20. These are segments that serve our pharmaceutical industry customers. And so, there'll continue to be some investments to improve those systems in readiness. But look, a lot of the future investments related to the FDA will depend on the court case.
Sam Samad: And then the other part of that $0.20 that you referenced is the IT investments that we're going to make that Jim talked about earlier. Those investments will continue. We have investments to modernize our systems. So, we don't expect that to be just this year. However, we talked on the Q3 call about our long-term guide in terms of expecting high single-digit EPS over the long term, and that we still - we reaffirm. So, those investments will continue, but they're part of our long-term guide expectation.
Operator: The next question comes from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is (indiscernible) for Luke Sergott. Thanks for the questions. Just to start off, could you guys provide a little more detail on what you expect the revenue contribution will be for the outreach lab services business acquisition you guys had with University Hospitals? And then assuming you'll get some benefit from the value-based contracts you have in place with payers, first, what's like the typical rate you get on top of your average reimbursement at the onset of these contracts, and how does that trend down in the next couple of years? And can we expect that kind of typical rate for this transaction?
Sam Samad: Maybe I'll start with the University Hospitals one, and Jim, you want to talk about value-based compensation or incentives in general, but in terms of University Hospitals, we made this acquisition, we closed it at the end of the year, so right at the end of 2024. It's an acquisition of roughly $180 million. We don't usually provide revenue per each of these outreach acquisitions. So, we're not going to provide exactly what the revenue is, but I'll give you a couple of points here to consider. Usually, there's a certain valuation that we pay for those acquisitions, which is somewhere around 3.5x of revenues. That doesn't mean that's what University Hospitals is, but there's a certain valuation we pay for these outreach acquisitions, and this is a ballpark kind of number on average. And then the other piece that you need to consider is that this contribution from University Hospitals is going to be in that acquired revenue growth bar that you see in the bridge that we have included on our website. And so, it's part of that $0.65 to $0.75 contribution in terms of EPS from acquisitions. Now, as I said before, LifeLabs is a healthy portion of that. There's other carryover from outreach acquisitions that we made in 2024 beyond just university, but that is included in that piece. Jim, did you want to give any comments on value-based incentives?
Jim Davis: Yes. From time to time, and we didn't really see any in the fourth quarter, but from time to time we get value-based incentive payments that are tied to moving recs from expensive health systems into Quest Diagnostics. That generally helps the payer, obviously, and as importantly, it helps the employer and it helps the patient. And so, some of those incentives come at a six-month period. Some come after a 12-month period look-back. So, they're hard to predict. And again, we call them out generally in our quarterly results when they do occur. Now, the other way we do collect some of these incentives is when we make these outreach acquisitions. And as you know, some of these health systems are getting 2x to 3x the rates that we're getting. Over time, our rates don't just migrate exactly to Quest Diagnostics rates. They'll come down over a period of two to three years. And so, there's what I call incremental pricing. So, as we move it from a health system payer rate to a Quest Diagnostics payer rate, sometimes those come as bonus payments and sometimes it's just part of the overall pricing.
Operator: The next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the competitive environment, you expanded access in several States in 2025 with two payers, then lost one State. How do you see the landscape shaping up in 2025? And do you see more RFPs coming up this year that could result in more turnover sort of next year? It’s just been a couple of years since you've seen this much volatility with States turnover. Thanks so much.
Jim Davis: Yes, so first of all, net-net on all of the payer changes that came about in 2024, we're better off. So, when we look at the lives that we picked up through Elevance in Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and we were not in network with some of the plans in Georgia, when we look at the lives that we pick up from Sentara and then we subtract the lives we lost in Alabama, we're better off by well more than a million lives. So, our access in total has significantly improved as we enter 2025. In terms of agreements that we will negotiate here in 2025, look, as you know, the typical health plan contract is somewhere between three and five years. So, every year we renew somewhere between 25% and 30% of health plan arrangements. And this year will be in that typical range. So, more to come on that, but every year we're renewing agreements in that magnitude and we're going to do it again this year.
Operator: The next question will come from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, just on the acquisition and integration, I believe you completed, my count is eight acquisitions in 2024, including big ones like LifeLabs had a lot of inorganic growth. How do you expect those acquisitions to enhance the revenue stream? And how should we think about as they lap the organic revenue growth, would that actually accelerate? And just thinking about puts and takes on integration speed, what exactly do you have to do this year, given the amount of acquisitions you did in the last year? And what would make you go back to a little bit more aggressive acquisitions, just given the fact that there is a lot out there available to you? Sorry, that was long.
Jim Davis: Yes, sure. So, as Sam indicated in his comments, the 2025 revenue growth that is coming from acquisitions, carryover acquisitions is about 6%. And as you know, we only carry that growth through the date - through the 12-month anniversary, okay? So, we closed LifeLabs in September of last year. It had five months of impact, four months of impact last year. And so, we carry that through the first seven, eight months of this year. So, in total, it's about six percentage points of our growth in 2025. And more than two thirds of that is LifeLabs, okay? So, we feel good about that. Now, yes, the team is hard at work at integrating these acquisitions, and yet the funnel of opportunities remains strong. So, we'll continue to assess the opportunities. We're not backing away from any if it fits our criteria of we have great payer access in that market. If our share is very small in that market, then it becomes an attractive opportunity for us to look at. So, while we have a lot of work to do to integrate what we've got on our plate, we're not going to be shy about picking things up and going after things that improve our market access.
Sam Samad: Maybe I can add just a couple of quick comments, Dave. You talked about sort of difficulty of integration and complexity of integration, and yes, there were a lot of acquisitions in 2024. Now remember, LifeLabs is more of a standalone entity that's in Canada. It's an established company. They have labs that are established. There's a lot of things that they can learn from us, but we can learn from them as well. So, I would say the integration is lighter there because they are already operating and we're not looking to close labs or move them to our systems at this point. So, that's an easier integration. And then you asked about sort of the cadence of M&A, what would it take to do more? Just keep in mind, I mean, it's not that we're not doing any more M&A in 2025. We have not included in our guide any new M&A that has not been announced, but we do have, in our capital plan, we have allocated certain capital for potential, what we call tuck-in M&A. It's mostly focused on the hospital outreach lab acquisitions. So, we will do more M&A because these are very attractive opportunities that scale very quickly and get to a healthy contribution margin. So, I just want to make sure that people don't expect that we're not going to do any more M&A
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Brackmann: Question. Hi guys, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on Haystack. First, can you maybe just sort of shed a little bit more light on any volume or reimbursement expectations for that asset in 2025? But I guess also bigger picture here and way more important than 2025, as you're moving these customers to those commercial programs, how should we be thinking about any additional pull-through or halo effect that having this asset now in the commercial phase should allow on the oncology side of the business? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so thanks, Andrew. So, look, we're pleased with the progress that we've made with Haystack. As we mentioned in the comments, we served over 70 customers on a non-revenue basis last year, a really nice mix of academic medical centers, community oncology. And so, the emphasis right now is on moving those customers into full commercial arrangements. Now, as we start, we're going to bill. We're going to bill Medicare. We're going to bill Medicare Advantage. We expect denials to be high at the beginning, but you then fight those denials, and you then begin the conversations with the appropriate MAC or the appropriate Medicare Advantage plan around the goodness of the test and why it is important for patients. And so, we do expect, as Sam indicated, to get modest revenue from that business this year. Now, you asked about other opportunities. First, let me remind everyone, look, oncology is a billion-dollar business for Quest Diagnostics today. That includes some of our screening assays. That includes a very, very strong anatomical pathology business, and it includes a very, very strong hematology business. So, we actually expect to get pull through of our MRD assay from the existing set of customers that we have. And we're already seeing that pay off. We also have, in addition to an MRD assay, we have a therapy planning assay, our TSO 500 assay. And so, we expect to get some benefits in that segment of our business as well.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Noah Kava: Hey, this is Noah on Tycho. Thanks for taking our call. I wanted to ask about preventative screening, particularly with the braid Well case going on. I was wondering how big your exposure is to preventative screening and if you have any assumptions on potential impact if USPSTF was authority. Thanks.
Jim Davis: I'm sorry. I mean, you mentioned that braid well kits.
Noah Kava: Case. So, for …
Jim Davis: Yes, I'm not …
Noah Kava: Basically for
Jim Davis: Yes, you were cutting out a little bit there, so I'm not I'm not familiar with the case. Sam, I don’t think you are. Okay. So, look, in general there seems to be what I would call a shift in focus going on across the country, and that shift in focus from taking - spending all our time and effort on sickness and in curing disease to this shift towards what I would call prevention and wellness. And in general, we actually think that is a wonderful shift for the lab industry, right? We strongly believe it's tied to our purpose, that lab testing should be used early, early and often in order to ensure somebody is not moving from one morbidity to another morbidity. And so, we're excited by a lot of the work that's going on in functional medicine today because that focus is really on prevention and wellness early. So, we feel good about that, and we think those trends are going to help the lab industry.
Operator: The next question will come from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you and good morning. Wanted to get - not sure if this was addressed. I don't think it was, but latest thoughts on Haystack. I know you talked about you’re expecting to generate some initial revenue here. But can you talk about expectations for clinical data updates we might be able to expect this year and just progress in terms of getting Medicare payment for the test? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So, I did give a few brief comments, but just for everyone, we went through this early experience program for six to seven months during 2024. And so, we gathered a lot of insights on our new assay. We gathered a lot of experience with close to (indiscernible) customers that touched academic medical centers as well as community oncology centers. So, we're now in the process of moving those customers to full commercial arrangements, which will include billing of Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans. Like any new test, you start the billing process, you expect some denials. You respond to those denials in a very thoughtful way, and you engage with the appropriate MAC as well as the Medicare Advantage plans. And so, look, we have a ton of experience with this, as you know. Our broad reach into every Medicare Advantage plan in the country, our health plan access, our relationships, are all very positive. And so, we will get revenue in this segment this year. So, in terms of new clinical studies, all I would say is stay tuned. Haystack, for many, many years, even prior to ownership by Quest Diagnostics, had funded many clinical trials, some of which are coming near an end, and we'll be able to publish, I think, some great results this year. Operator, next question.
Operator: The final question for today will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. Just a bigger picture question as we head into kind of 2025 and how you think about how it's progressing in terms of market share gains versus underlying utilization. What's embedded in your expectations on that front? I know you talked a little bit about the underlying environment, but I particularly want to know because is it accelerating in terms of the market, underlying market share gains that you're seeing as well? And then also just lastly, if I can stick one in there on PAMA SALSA regulatory environment. You spoke to LDT stuff, but any thoughts in terms of the change in kind of administration and how you're viewing your visibility into that? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so let me start with the latter question on PAMA. So, as you know, the rate cuts did not go into place. So, this was the fifth year that rates were left the same. And we feel good about that. I would actually say, there's going to be renewed focus on PAMA reform this year. As you know, there's three committees that we generally work with. There's the Senate Finance Committee, the House and Means committee, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Those three committees are really charged with all things healthcare in this country. So, the committee - in two of the three, there's new committee chair people. We know who they are. We've already had outreach to them, and I would say, look, there is strong bipartisan support to actually solve it this year. So, we're excited about the opportunity to get a final solution to PAMA as we work throughout 2025. I can tell you, it's the number one priority of our ACLA trade association. And we've been hard at work since January 2 to get a solution in place. Yes. So, on the market share utilization question, look, I think in general for the independent labs, that all independent labs are making progress from a market share standpoint. What you see, the outreach acquisitions that we've done is a sign that hospitals are less focused on gathering that work in the communities and more focused on deploying their capital, their assets, their resources, their know-how to other parts of health system operations. So, I feel good about our prospects. It was a share gain year and again, I just think we're seeing health systems pay less attention to that outreach book of business than they have in the past. And I think that's great signs for Quest Diagnostics as well as the independent lab industry.
Operator: That was our final question for today, sir. Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full-year 2024 conference call.
Jim Davis: Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining in and look forward to seeing you all on March 19th at our Investor Day in New York City.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and the question and answer session that will follow, are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I’d now like to turn the call over to Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details from the third quarter, I want to recognize the Quest employees who are working hard to serve our patients and customers impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton while also contending with the effects on their personal lives. I’m inspired by their commitment to our values, especially customer focus, collaboration and care during this very difficult time. They bring to life our purpose, working together to create a healthier world one life at a time. Now turning to our results. We delivered a strong third quarter with total revenue growth of 8.5%, including 4.2% organic growth, driven by new customer wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed three acquisitions. We finalized our acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted lab leader serving millions of Canadians. LifeLabs provides a strong foundation for us to expand in Canada, and we are excited about the growth opportunities serving a population that is growing and with more favorable demographics than in the U.S. We also completed our transaction with Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system serving Minnesota and western Wisconsin; and at the end of the quarter, we acquired the laboratory business of three physician groups in New York. During the quarter, we also announced the plans to acquire select outreach lab assets from Ohio Health and University Hospitals, two leading non-profit health systems in Ohio. We completed the transaction with Ohio Health just last week and expect to complete the acquisition with University Hospitals later this quarter. Our recent outreach acquisitions highlight our ability to attract top health systems seeking to evolve their lab strategies to improve access and affordability. They also position us to expand in geographic areas of the U.S. where the influence of health systems had previously limited our reach. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions this year that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns. Now I’ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the third quarter, and then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in each of these areas. In physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by new customer wins and expanded business, largely due to increased utilization of our advanced diagnostics. Our acquisitions also contributed to growth within this core customer channel, and as a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in physician offices. We also continued to see strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost efficient options like Quest. During the quarter, we also made progress to expand into new geographies through our health plan partnerships. We renewed a large national health plan agreement with Elevance Health that will extend our reach in Virginia, Georgia, Colorado and Nevada, markets in which we had previously limited access. We also broadened our access in Virginia and Florida with our recently announced arrangements with Sentara Health Plans. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues mid single digits, which is above historical levels. Hospitals continues to struggle to fill specialized lab positions, including histology, cytotechnology, and microbiology. In addition, the range and scope of testing being ordered is increasing as hospitals take advantage of our expanding advanced diagnostics portfolio rather than building their own in-house capability. These dynamics contributed to strong continued demand for reference testing. Our expertise managing laboratories can help hospitals improve quality and efficiency in their core lab operations. During the quarter, we formed a professional lab services collaboration with a leading health system in New Jersey that includes reference testing as well as laboratory and supply chain management. Quest specializes in scaling diagnostic innovations to improve access, quality and affordability. This ability enables us to help hospitals address the many challenges that they face, from workforce shortages to capital constraints to the demand for more affordable care from patients, health plans and employers. That’s why premier health systems continue to seek us out for a range of collaborations, ranging from reference testing to professional lab management to outreach acquisitions. In consumer initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, QuestHealth.com grew total revenues more than 40%. Our repeat customer rate has grown to 30% from less than 10% two years ago, driven by demand for comprehensive health, chronic disease, and STI testing. During the quarter, we also introduced micronutrient blood tests to help identify vitamin and mineral deficiencies. In addition, we continued to expand our partner network with resellers and ecommerce providers. In advanced diagnostics, we drove double-digit revenue growth across several clinical areas. The growth was particularly strong in areas of brain health, especially for our AD-Detect blood-based Alzheimer’s disease testing as well as in women’s health, cardio-metabolic health, and autoimmune disorders. Our investments in advanced diagnostics enable us to deliver and scale innovative services that improve patient care and drive growth. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are pleased with the results to date from our Haystack MRD early experience program through which providers from many leading academic and community oncology centers have used our Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for solid tumor cancers. We are on track to make Haystack MRD available nationally to providers in the fourth quarter. Our growth in women’s health was largely driven by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, consistent with recent quarters. We also saw continued robust testing demand in genital tract infections, which includes several STIs. This month, we introduced a specimen self-collection option at our 2000 patient service centers that give women a fast, convenient and discrete way to access GTI testing. In the area of autoimmune disorders, we saw strong demand for our testing solutions which help primary care physicians comprehensively screen for autoimmune disorders in order speed diagnosis and care by specialists. Finally, we were pleased to have been selected by the CDC to be one of a handful of diagnostic service providers to support the development of laboratory tests for H5N1 avian flu and oropouche viruses. We plan to introduce an H5N1 avian flu test later this month. Now turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements driven largely through the use of automation and AI to improve productivity, as well as service levels and quality. During the quarter, we completed the build-out of full end-to-end automation for our core routine tests at our Lenexa, Kansas laboratory, making it the third fully automated lab in our national network. We are now piloting automated specimen accessioning in our Clifton lab, which will help increase productivity in specimen processing and improve quality. Finally, we are pleased to extend our collaboration with Hologic to include their automated cytology solution, the Hologic Genius digital diagnostic system which utilizes AI to help analyze cervical cell samples. We expect this solution will help us improve quality and efficiency in cervical cancer screening. Now before I turn it over to Sam, I want to take a moment to recognize the decision by Congress to delay Medicare reimbursement cuts and data collection scheduled under PAMA for 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to collaborate with our trade association, ACLA, to encourage Congress to secure a permanent legislative solution that provides fair reimbursement. Now Sam will give more details on our third quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.49 billion, up 8.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.2%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 9% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our key physician and hospital channels as well as the contribution from recently closed acquisitions. As a reminder, our acquisition of LifeLabs closed towards the end of August, and our outreach acquisition from Allina Health closed in September. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.5% versus the third quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 5% to total volume. The impact of weather and the Crowdstrike global IT outage in July negatively impacted volume by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. Total revenue per requisition was up 3.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix driven by advanced diagnostics demand, partially offset by the impact of the recent LifeLabs acquisition which carries a lower revenue per requisition than our typical average. Unit price reimbursement was stable, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $330 million or 13.3% of revenues compared to $342 million or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $385 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $380 million or 16.6% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather and the Crowdstrike outage, as well as wage increases and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather and the IT outage on operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points. LifeLabs had a negligible impact on operating margin rates in the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.99 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 versus $2.22 the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather and the IT outage to be approximately $0.08 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $870 million year-to-date through the third quarter versus $745 million in the prior year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8%. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $9.8 billion and $9.85 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.55 to $7.65 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.85 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our updated revenue guidance is related to recently announced and closed acquisitions, with the majority being from LifeLabs. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters, therefore we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024 but do expect increasing profitability next year. We are projecting the disruption from Hurricane Milton to negatively impact revenues by approximately $15 million and EPS by approximately $0.08 in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is expected to be down versus the prior year due to the integration of LifeLabs and the combined impact of weather and Crowdstrike headwinds. Excluding the impact of these items, full year operating margin is expected to be up. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $200 million, weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. We have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance and maintain the midpoint of $8.90 despite the impact of Hurricane Milton in the fourth quarter. While we aren’t prepared to provide 2025 guidance today, I’d like to share some initial considerations as you think about next year. We are reaffirming our long term outlook from 2023 through 2026, which assumes a mid single digit revenue CAGR with at least 1% to 2% growth from acquisitions, and a high single digit earnings CAGR with approximately 75 to 150 basis points of margin expansion over the three-year period. Given the eight acquisitions we expect to complete in 2024, we will exceed our 1% to 2% revenue growth targets from acquisitions next year. Excluding LifeLabs, we already expect to be towards the high end of this range due to the carryover contribution from the other acquisitions that will be completed this year. Interest expense is expected to increase next year as a result of our recent debt issuance. As I noted previously, we raised $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8% in August, and in March of 2025 we plan to retire $600 million of senior notes with a coupon of 3.5%. Finally, as we consider all the moving pieces heading into 2025, we expect to deliver earnings growth consistent with our long term outlook in the high single digits. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and organic revenue growth driven by new customers wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions by year’s end that meet our criteria for profitability, growth and returns. Our growing advanced diagnostics offering and increasing health plan access positions us to drive new customer business next year. Given the strength of our business and revenue from acquisitions, we are well positioned to drive accelerated revenue growth and earnings growth in 2025. With that, we’d be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. Thank you. Thanks for all the details on 2025. When you think about next year, how do you think the organic growth profile of the business will do? And within that, can you remind us with Haystack, is there any change in your assumptions now that you’ve had the asset for over a year on how you think it will do in 2025? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes. So good morning, Ann. We just came off a very strong quarter of organic growth of 4.2%, driven by good volume growth and really nice improvements in rev per req, those improvements in rev per req coming with basically price being about flat, price per test, but really nice increases in tests per req and test mix. So as we enter into 2025, we would put out there at this point approximately 3%, I mean, it’s hard to judge what’s going to go on with utilization, but by all means and based on some of the payor report outs earlier in the week and last week, it appears that utilization remains strong. So I think an assumption of roughly 3% is solid. In terms of Haystack, we’ve said the dilution this year is approximately $0.20. We said the dilution going into next year would be less, and we’re still on track to achieve that.
Sam Samad: Yes, with regards to Haystack, Ann, the incremental dilution this year is $0.20, so it’s a total of $0.35 to $0.40 dilution, and it will improve next year. And we are preparing to launch the assay in the next few months here and expect to get reimbursement as we go forward as well.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe if I can go back to just some of your commentary about the marketplace and your positioning, if I heard correctly, I think you had some incremental share gains from Elevance, obviously, you have a combination of inorganic growth. As you think about building on Ann’s question a bit relative to the organic side, how much do you feel like the growth profile is within your control relative to that share pick-up, relative to what you’re doing on the pricing side versus market driven? If there’s any we can break that down, that’d be great.
Jim Davis: Yes. So first, thanks for the question, Mike. With respect to Elevance, none of those changes take effect until the first of the year in 2025, and those changes, which are allowing us to be in network in the states of Colorado and in the states of Nevada, with expanded access in Georgia and Virginia. But again none of those changes have any impact on our third quarter results, but we expect those to help fuel organic growth going into next year.
Sam Samad: Maybe if I add also, with regards to pricing and share gains, I think in terms of pricing, we still expect flattish to slightly improving reimbursement dynamics within our business - I think that’s the expectation going forward, as it is this year, so we’re seeing a positive improvement in reimbursement dynamics. And in addition to the increased access that Jim just talked about, we are also seeing share gains as a result of the hospital outreach acquisitions that we’ve made, where we’ve gained some -- we’ve shifted share and we’ve gained some good market share recently as a result of these acquisitions.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one on LifeLabs, nice to see that close early. Can you just talk a little about both the margin impact that you see near term there, I know obviously accretive to earnings, but just the margin impact; and then the progression on the earnings accretion as we get into next year? I know there’s some accounting stuff that maybe holds it back a little bit and then it should step up, but it would be helpful just to talk through that profile. And then lastly just Jim, on the M&A side, since we’re on the topic. What the pipeline looks like? Should we expect continued smaller deals versus something like LifeLabs, being a much larger one, and what you’re seeing there? Thank you, again.
Sam Samad: Yes, you’re welcome, and good morning, Patrick. So with regards to -- I’ll talk maybe briefly about operating margins first, and then I’ll talk about how LifeLabs impacted it in Q3 and what the trajectory is going forward, just at a high level. We won’t go into too much details in terms of the actual specifics around the deal. But in Q3, operating margins were 15.5%. I would say adjusted for weather, that was closer to 16%. We had both weather and CrowdStrike impacted us by about 50 basis points. There was a slight negative impact from LifeLabs as well in the quarter. As you know, we had about five weeks’ worth of LifeLabs revenues in there. The deal is scaling up in terms of profitability. There are some adjustments at the beginning as well in terms of some accounting adjustments, as you mentioned. But really, the margin profile of the deal is expected to increase as we go forward. Now, we talked about potential $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion from the deal in year one, and that was assuming that the deal would close basically at the end of the year, so we’d have a full year in 2025. So, the deal closed a bit earlier, so we still -- we’ll give more color on the Q4 call in terms of what the expectation is for 2025 specifically. But listen, at a high level, Patrick, I would just say that the operating margin to start will be below our overall operating margin as an enterprise. So it’s going to be a bit dilutive in terms of operating margin rates but accretive in terms of operating margin dollars and EPS. And it’s going to ramp up over the next two to three years to eventually be at the level of Quest operating margins, but that’s going to take some time. So, I’d say focus more on operating margin dollars and EPS accretion that we get from the deal, as opposed to the operating margin rates in the short term.
Jim Davis: Yes. Patrick, in terms of your question on -- the last part of your question on the funnel and the M&A pipeline. So it does remain strong, and lots of discussions going on with various health systems around the country. But what I would say now is we’re in this phase of integration and digestion of the deals that we’ve just completed, including the lab assets of PathAI, Allina Health System, Ohio Health, University Hospitals, the three physician office labs here in New York, and then obviously LifeLabs. So we are hard at work at integrating these and getting the margin accretion that we’ve talked about. Our appetite will continue for small outreach deals, and we’re always on the look for those.
Operator: The next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning guys. Can I go back to the questions on Elevance and Sentara Health, on those contracts you talked about earlier? I guess, why weren’t you in those contracts previously? Did you have to give any pricing concessions in any states in order to go in those markets, or did you give pricing concessions to enter the states? Who was previously servicing those patients? It’s just been a long time since we’ve seen such large managed care contract wins for you guys, so just curious were other central labs servicing these guys or is it simply payors pushing large labs, who take share from hospital-based labs? Thanks so much.
Jim Davis: Yes, so with respect to Elevance, we’ve been in their network broadly on a national basis, except for the markets that I indicated - Colorado and Nevada, we were completely out of their network. Georgia, we had limited access to some products but not all, and the same with Virginia. This is just an opening up, like many of the other large national labs, that provide access to all the independent labs, so we feel great on that. Sentara, we were previously not serving - it was being served by other laboratories, and they made the decision to put us in their network. It’s a great health plan, a great health system that was in Virginia, but the health plan actually goes down well below Virginia into the Carolinas and Florida, so we feel really, really good about that. Look, I think it represents just a commitment on behalf of these health plans to include independent labs that offer great quality. It starts with great quality, great service, and really competitive pricing.
Shawn Bevec: Next question, Operator?
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Meghan Holtz: Good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. This is Meghan Holtz on for Brian. Just going back to guidance, at [indiscernible] core EPS guidance is up slightly, right? If I just check my math, the midpoint stays at $8.90 but you have to add back the $0.08 from Milton, while LifeLabs should be a little less, so can you just kind of break down that EPS guidance?
Sam Samad: Yes, sure. To talk about EPS guidance, let me talk a little bit about revenue as well, because--you know, we took up revenue, as you know, by $285 million at the midpoint. The majority of that was really M&A, and the majority of the M&A was really LifeLabs, so in terms of the $285 million at the midpoint, I would say the majority really is driven by M&A, which as we said scales up with profitability, so little to no profitability in the initial term. To your point around EPS, we tightened the range by a nickel on each side. The midpoint remains unchanged at $8.90. We are absorbing an $0.08 headwind from Milton in Q4, so yes, you are correct in the sense that EPS excluding the impact of Milton would have gone up, and that’s driven by the strength of the organic business. We’re seeing some, as you saw in Q3, great rev per req at 3.3%, organic rev per req was even higher than that. We’re seeing good utilization, so some of that strength is offsetting the impact of Milton, but largely kept the EPS unchanged at the midpoint.
Meghan Holtz: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg : Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I believe [audio loss] reduced pretty meaningfully. I think you’re still seeing wage inflation here above historical norms, so can you just talk about some of the pushes and pulls in terms of historically low unemployment rate? Are there actually maybe some tailwinds you’re seeing with insurance and other things, maybe even price increases that could help offset that, and can you talk about maybe some of the headwinds in terms of wage pressures, how long they’re expected to continue, and if we did continue to see some of those wage pressures, are there any other ways you can get operating leverage, say AI, automation, etc.? Thank you.
Sam Samad: Dave, just real quick, you broke up there in the very beginning. What did you start with?
David Westenberg: I started there with turnover rates being reduced; however, I still believe wage inflation is above historical norms, so can you just talk about the pushes and pulls with that, and then I think you got the rest of the question all right.
Sam Samad: Yes, we got it, thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so as we indicated in the script, our turnover rates have come down here in 2024, so last year they were in the low 20s, and we’re now below 20%, in the 18% to 19% range. Some of this still depends on job category, but overall we’ve seen really nice improvement. Now, the wage inflation of 3% to 4%, I’d say it’s slightly less than last year, but in terms of historical norms, if you want to go back to 2012 to 2019, kind of pre-COVID, I would tell you it was in the 2% to 3% range, so it’s 100 basis points higher than it historically was. As we walk into next year, it might be a bit early to tell, but I would still think it’s going to hang closer to 3%, in that range. I think you’re reading the same articles we are - the quit rate in American has certainly come down. I think unemployment is relatively stable, so I think there will be continued tightness in the labor markets, particularly on our frontline employees, and by those employees, we mean our phlebotomists, our logistics, our specimen processors. It’s actually those positions where we see a more competitive labor environment primarily because those three types of roles, they can move from industry to industry. They don’t need to stay in the lab industry. Now, there’s lots of things we’re doing to continue to offset that wage inflation. We’ve talked a lot about the use of automation and AI in our laboratories. As we indicated in the script, we just went live with our third highly automated laboratory, full automation in our Lenexa, Kansas operation. We’ve installed what we called some front end specimen automation sorting types of equipment in several of our laboratories, and we’re getting nice use out of that; and then we continue to expand some of our automated and AI-driven platforms, like the COPAN--the COPAN microbiology platform, which continues to give us a ton of productivity across our laboratories.
Sam Samad: Yes, and if I just add a couple of things, David, with regards to just overall productivity and leverage in the P&L as both we look in 2024 and going forward, but we are seeing a couple of positive dynamics there as well that I’m sure you’re aware of. In terms of rev per req, pricing is a modest favorable. I don’t mean to say that it still isn’t a challenging pricing environment in the health system space, but overall we’re getting flat to positive reimbursement. We’re seeing tests per req continue to go up versus historically, we’re seeing a nice step up in terms of tests per req as well as test mix, which are both giving us a positive in terms of overall rev per req. Utilization, we’ve talked about continues to be positive, and also aided by the fact that we’ve gained share with some of the acquisitions that we’ve done, so overall all of these would drive us to additional productivity and improved leverage as we look forward, and this year in 2024.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow up--for Sam, I have a couple of follow-ups, just trying to dig into the quarterly revenue a little bit. The first was could you just tell me what the COVID sales were? I’m trying to gauge what the base was doing within the 4% organic growth. Then second is it looks like M&A added about $100 million of sales in the quarter. How much was the initial five weeks from LifeLabs versus everything else? Could it have been, like, 50/50?
Sam Samad: Sure Jack, yes. With regards to COVID, as you have noted, we’ve stopped really reporting COVID and we’ve stopped reporting base versus total, because it’s really become somewhat insignificant. All I would say is it was largely within our expectations in Q3. It’s impacted from a year-to-year--on a year-to-year basis, it impacted growth by about 50 basis points. That was the impact of COVID in terms of total impact on revenue growth. Now with regards to M&A, I think your other question, so we grew by 8.5% in total revenues for the quarter, organic growth was about 4.2%, so we had about a 4% contribution from M&A. LifeLabs over five weeks or so was about $70 million roughly in terms of revenues in the quarter, so that should give you a sense as to the contribution of LifeLabs. Obviously it’s a significant portion of the M&A growth.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. [Audio loss] so long term question. One, can you just confirm the DCP impact in the quarter? I know that created some unnecessary volatility, just--you know, it was always neutral to EPS. Then longer term, I think what you guys were saying was it sounds like you’re saying in general that unit pricing, we should think of sort of as stable to slightly positive for 2025 as well - I think that’s what you are saying. Just if you could confirm that, that’d be great. Thank you.
Sam Samad: Yes, with regards to DCP, Elizabeth - first, thanks for the question. On a year-to-year basis, it was up, I would say close to $10 million in the quarter itself, so it was a negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. That should give you the detail that you want. It’s going to ebb and flow depending on the markets, but this quarter it was a negative impact year-over-year. Then with regards to pricing, I think the current view and what we’ve been seeing in 2024 is that--you know, if I kind of bifurcate that, health systems is definitely a net negative in terms of a challenging health systems environment, in terms of the reimbursement and pricing dynamics. Health plans, I would say modestly positive, flat to modestly positive. Overall when you put the pieces together, and we’ve got the government business right now, we expect to be flat pricing as well since the PAMA cuts were deferred, so overall I’d say the expectation is flat to slightly positive, is the current view. We’ll give you more information when we give specific 2025 guidance on the Q4 call.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Yes, the next question is from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. With the hospital outreach deals and the market share gains, you’ve been talking about that a little bit more recently, and are there specific geographies where you’re seeing that sort of halo effect around these deals? Has anything changed in terms of your strategy around what you target or how you’re approaching these hospital outreach deals? I guess any way to quantify it as well how much in terms of market share gains is this contributing at the moment, just from either a volume or revenue perspective? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so the three deals we announced, Allina in the Minneapolis market and closed Ohio Health in Columbus, Ohio, and University Hospitals which we expect to close later in the quarter in Cleveland, Ohio, all three of those markets had the characteristics of the majority of independent physicians were owned by health systems and therefore using the labs of those health systems. It puts us into those three marketplaces. Our share in those markets was de minimis before these acquisitions, and so now we have a strong presence in those three markets, all of which are big markets, growing markets. We will continue to look for other markets in the U.S. where we have strong payor access. By the way, in all of those markets, we were in network with obviously all the nationals and all the Blues plans that play in those markets, so we had strong access but our ability to sell, given that the physicians were largely owned by the health systems, was very limited. Those are the characteristics of the markets that we look for in terms of these outreach acquisitions. We look for markets where we have strong access, which we do nationally, and we look for markets where health systems have dominated in that space and they may be willing to get out of that market.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephanie Davis: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. You had in the prepared remarks comments about volume and revenue benefits from narrower networks at the MA plans, so I was curious, given some of the challenges those clients are facing, could you see potential for an accelerated pace of adoption of this strategy and some forward benefits in the coming few years?
Jim Davis: I think all of the Medicare Advantage plans versus Medicare are going to have, by definition, more narrow networks. Medicare, as you know, is any willing provider, and if you look at the Medicare work spread across the country, that health systems generally do fairly well in that space. Again, by definition when a life moves from a Medicare plan to a Medicare Advantage plan, most of the Medicare Advantage plans have networks that are more defined and more narrow, so there is generally good things that come from that. Now going forward, the Medicare Advantage plans, yes, they seem to be under some--they’re experiencing higher utilization - that’s generally good for us, but they’re experiencing profit pressures on that book of business as well, so to the extent more of that work comes to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics, it means good quality, great service, and generally lower costs, so we welcome the opportunity to work with all the Medicare Advantage plans to continue to move work from high priced out-of-network labs to labs like Quest Diagnostics.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, good morning. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on LifeLabs. Jim, I think in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that the demographics are more favorable in Canada. Can you maybe just help us understand what market growth looks like in Canada, and then secondly, you talked about the margins being below the corporate average at Quest today and that over two to three years, you’ll get there? Can you give us an idea of what the margins look like today for LifeLabs?
Jim Davis: Yes, so first on the demographics of Canada, the population growth of Canada is actually significantly higher than the U.S., so it’s been north of 1% for the last several years, so that’s good news for us and for all those that participate. Second is the aging of the Canadian population is also--the average age of the population there is north of what it is in the U.S., and the demographics of older people--you know, what we see in the U.S., obviously Medicare and Medicare Advantage, there is more reqs per life, they visit physicians more frequently, generally higher acuity levels, and so serving an older population is also beneficial to the industry, to us. That’s why we like the demographics of Canada. There’s some variation between that in Ontario, in British Columbia, the two major provinces that we serve, but in total we think it’s a great place to operate. Now in terms of the margin, yes, the operating margin rate is lower than our company average, and we expect over the next couple years, through the synergies that we expect to get and through sharing of ideas, best practices from us to them and them to us, we expect to get the margin rate back to close to Quest company average.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Brackmann: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to go back to your comment on integration and digestion. Can you maybe just sort of talk about how your integration efforts or tactics have evolved over the last few years, the things that you can share which maybe give a little bit more comfort on keeping up this accelerated pace of deals going forward? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yes, so it very much depends on the deal. I mean, let’s start with LifeLabs - LifeLabs, it operates in Canada, obviously we’re here in the U.S., so there is not what I would call big synergies across--we’re not shutting down any laboratories, we’re not changing the phlebotomy network or the logistics network at all. What we do look for in opportunities like that is--you know, we look for procurement synergies, right - what are we buying things at, what are they buying things at, and then we’re going to take the best of the best price, and in general that is on the Quest Diagnostics side. Second is we benchmark their operations versus our operations - you know, in phlebotomy, the draws per FTE, logistics, how many stops per person. In the laboratory, we benchmark not just the overall laboratory but the departments within the laboratory - microbiology, auto chemistry. Really what it is, it’s a series of best practices shared from each side, and in some cases we obviously learn things from them that we bring back into our operations. That’s the nature of LifeLabs. Now, with the health system deals, in general what we’re acquiring is a book of business. We’re not acquiring laboratories, we’re not acquiring logistics. In many cases, we take on the phlebotomists that were serving that network. Really, the integration is about, number one, IT integration, integrating with all of their physicians, whether they’re on Epic or Cerner of whatever EMR they’re on; and then second, it’s about the movement of that work from the hospital lab into Quest Diagnostics, so we look for opportunities in logistics and, again, phlebotomy to get synergies and productivity out of that. Generally, what we bring to these integrations are dedicated full time groups of people. They hit within the regional structure of Quest, so depending on the region, we come in with a dedicated team that works the IT side, the phlebotomy side, the logistics side and the laboratory side, and as Sam said in his remarks, it will take several quarters to get these books of business up to the profitability rate that we expect. It’s a lot of hard work and the team has some deep experience in doing this.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for getting my question in - I appreciate it. I just want to go through some of these moving pieces. I appreciated the color that you gave on 2025, but if we just kind of think--tell me I’m not thinking about this incorrectly, revenue growth should probably be better, given all the M&A that’s maturing into next year. You talked about the organic growth is still estimated to be up 3% roughly. The cost trends, wages and the like, 3% to 4%--3%, hopefully Invigorate is there to offset that, plus you add in the benefit of the maturation of LifeLabs, which $0.10 to $0.15, is probably going to be more than that as you’re getting an extra quarter than you anticipated, and you have Haystack dilution coming down. Isn’t it-- I mean, unless I’m not thinking about the impact, or there is a negative impact to core margins, shouldn’t EPS grow faster next year than your traditional CAGR, just thinking about all those moving pieces?
Sam Samad: Yes, so I think you’ve got the moving pieces right, Kevin. As you said, we’ve got--and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we’ve got M&A excluding LifeLabs growing at the high end of the range that we’ve given, about 2%. We’ve got LifeLabs adding a full year worth of revenues in there, so that will help revenues as well, so yes, revenue growth will be faster. We’ve got also the carryover from some of the M&A that we’ve done this year. I mean, in terms of the cost headwinds right now, it’s, I’d say early to say that we’re going to face lesser headwinds in general, like in terms of inflation for instance. We’re still assuming in general that 3% to 4%. I wouldn’t say that we’re assuming that that’s going to moderate significantly next year, so what we’re seeing today is in that 3% to 4% range, and I think we’re expecting that to be the same. I think the pricing dynamics, we’ll give more detail on that on the Q4 call, but in general fairly in line with what we’re seeing right now, which is flat to slightly positive, although as I said before, we are seeing competitive dynamics in the health system space. For now, we’re seeing EPS is growing in the high single digits, so to the extent that we provide more information on the Q4 call that’s different than that, we will; but at this point with the visibility that we have with all the moving pieces, we feel comfortable just reaffirming that growth rate for EPS. There isn’t anything here that’s a negative that we’re--you know, that you’re teasing out, that’s something that we’re not disclosing. It’s basically we feel comfortable that with all the moving parts, that we’re at the high end of the guidance range that we gave before.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our last question will come from Michael Riskin of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.
Michael Riskin: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I’ll close with one, a lot of this has been covered. I wanted to ask a little bit on PAMA - obviously it’s been delayed. You made some comments about potentially working on a permanent legislative solution. Could you expand on that a little bit, like what that could look like, and obviously PAMA has been delayed for a number of years now, so we’re kind of used to this, but any sense of what the future could look like there, just so we’re not in a constant delay cycle again? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so you’re right - PAMA has now been delayed five straight years, and it is certainly a welcome relief to us and to our entire industry. Now having said that, look - SALSA has continued to be on the legislative agenda. It’s a complex task to get these things approved - there is one Senate committee, two House committees that you have to work through, and as you know with the election coming up, a lot of these committees could potentially change - the leadership can change, members can change, and so our trade association and the members of it will be hard at work once the election is over and once the committee memberships are defined, we’ll be hard at work to figure out who on these committees are going to support us and to put forth a fix to this constant year-over-year, I would say battle that we have to defer these cuts. We were happy with the SALSA solution, which called for--if enacted, called for another year of a delay followed by a new data collection process. There were agreed to reductions, but I’m not sure that’s the solution we’re going to put forth on the table. You know, we’ve had five straight years of delayed cuts, and while that sounds good, in fact it’s not good because we’ve had five really heavy years of wage inflation and other inflation, and we’re going to press the case that in fact the Medicare rates should go up. We’ve gotten rates up through our commercial plans. Yes, as Sam said, there’s been pressure on our hospital reference pricing, but we believe, given the inflationary environment that we’ve lived in from 2019 to 2024, that the rates need to go up, and so that’s the fix that we’re going to propose. We believe a new data collection process will indicate that when they benchmark our pricing across all the commercial plans, including what the commercial plans are paying hospital labs. I think we’ll find that the combination of those prices would lead one to believe that Medicare pricing should go up, so that’s what we’re going to push for going forward.
Jim Davis: Okay, so thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate your support. Have a good day, everyone.

Any references to base business, testing, revenues, or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks Shawn and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter, with base business revenue growth of nearly 4% and total revenue growth of 2.5% as well as continued improvement in productivity and profitability in the base business. This performance is due to growth of new physician and hospital customers, more favorable test mix that includes greater adoption of advanced diagnostics and continued strength in healthcare utilization. We also made progress improving our operational quality and efficiency through greater use of automation and AI. In addition, we are excited to announce four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns, and that will enable us to expand in strategic growth areas. Our planned acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted name in laboratory services for millions of Canadians, will enable us to grow in Canada, which has a population that is growing, and aging faster, than in the U.S. LifeLabs is especially strong in two of Canada’s largest and fastest growing provinces, British Columbia and Ontario, which collectively account for about half of the country’s population. We are familiar with the Canadian market, having delivered reference testing to many providers there for over 20 years. LifeLabs has been one of those reference partners for about a decade, so we know firsthand that their business, team and reputation is strong, and provides a solid foundation for growth. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year. Our recently announced acquisition of Select Lab Assets of Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system, will enable us to extend our reach in Minneapolis and throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. We also announced our plans to acquire the outreach lab assets of OhioHealth, a nationally recognized charitable health system in Ohio. Both transactions will broaden our presence in geographic areas of the United States where we’ve had limited access to providers due to the predominance of health systems. These acquisitions show our ability to attract and partner with top, growing health systems that share our commitment to expanding patient access to innovative and more affordable testing. We expect to complete both transactions in the third quarter. We also completed our acquisition of PathAI Diagnostics, which provides a readymade platform on which to scale digital pathology and AI to help health systems and other providers improve quality, speed and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. These acquisitions take time and involve teams of dedicated individuals. I want to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering on our M&A strategy, and we will now turn our attention to the hard work of integrating these deals. Now, I’ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the second quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including within brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on progress we have made in each of these areas. While we grew total volumes from Diagnostic Information Services 1.1% with base business volume growth of 1.7%, volumes from our base clinical business grew 3.2% in the second quarter, due to the strength among physicians and hospitals. In Physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit base business revenue growth. This growth was driven by continued strength in healthcare utilization, as well as overall market growth, and share gains due to new customer wins. We drove favorable test mix as well as growth in test per requisition, which we attribute to greater utilization of our expanding portfolio of advanced diagnostics. Finally, we also saw strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost-efficient options like Quest. Our broad health plan access, which extends to approximately 90% of covered lives in the U.S., enabled us to take advantage of high demand for lab services, consistent with recent quarters. Health plans value our ability to improve access, scale innovation and drive costs out of healthcare. We are also working to develop opportunities to serve new geographies with our health plan partners. In Hospital lab services, we grew base business revenues by nearly 4%. Growth of reference testing remains higher than historical levels as hospitals struggled to fill open positions, especially in technical fields, such as histotechnology, microbiology and cytotechnology. Our advanced diagnostics portfolio provides a compelling alternative for hospitals to send us more reference work. Hospitals face several challenges, including high supply costs, high wages and decisions about how and where to deploy their capital. Patients want better value from lab services as well as easier access. Plus, diagnostic innovation is evolving at a fast pace. These dynamics are contributing to an accelerating trend of outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements with the national labs. Our specialization and scale empower us to deliver a breadth of quality, innovative and accessible services that are often far more affordable for the patient. That’s why top hospitals are choosing Quest for reference testing, professional lab services and outreach asset sales that deliver quality and efficiency. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer facing platform, questhealth.com, grew total revenues nearly 40% while base business revenues grew more than 50% versus the prior year. As we learn more about our customers as our portfolio expands, we are improving growth and marketing productivity. Today, about 25% of our revenues are from existing customers and 20% of our revenues are from tests we introduced in the past year. In Advanced Diagnostics, several key clinical areas drove double-digit revenue growth, continuing the trend in recent quarters. This growth was particularly strong in brain health, women’s health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Our Alzheimer’s disease portfolio was the primary driver of growth for our brain health offering. Demand was strong for our AD-Detect blood tests which assess risk based on amyloid, p-tau and APOE biomarkers. Demand was also strong for our CSF test options for aiding treatment decisions. Yesterday, we introduced our Neurofilament Light Chain test, which helps assess neuronal damage that may signify Alzheimer’s disease as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are encouraged by early results of our Haystack MRD Early Experience program prior to the broad national launch later this year. Physicians from leading cancer institutions are using the Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for a range of cancers, including colorectal, lung and breast. We also grew the body of evidence on the clinical and economic value of ctDNA blood testing in cancer care. A study published in JAMA Health Forum in June found that MRD testing could reduce costs for health plans, particularly commercial payers, by identifying patients that would benefit from chemotherapy after stage II colon cancer surgery. In addition, research presented at the June ASCO conference showed that Haystack MRD testing identified complete clinical response to immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer earlier than standard assessments, such as PET,MRI and endoscopy scans. Finally, we recently expanded our Haystack research collaborations to include Lisata Therapeutics, which will use Haystack MRD to study an investigational treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Turning to advanced cardiometabolic testing, we are seeing interest in several biomarkers that improve early detection of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease. These include insulin resistance, which can identify pre-diabetes risk before AIc tests, and ApoB, a more precise marker of heart attack risk than traditional lipid panels. They also include Lp(a), which is an inherited marker of heart disease risk found in up to 20% of the population and for which several therapies are now in development. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we expanded our use of automation and AI in order to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we advanced our use of automation in front-end specimen processing to now include five of our labs, freeing more of our processors to focus on value-added work. We also expanded our AI capabilities in microbiology to include the ability to segregate out specimens with no evidence of microbial growth so our medical scientists can concentrate on reviewing those with the greatest likelihood of disease. In addition, we broadened our use of AI in customer service to help our representatives access answers more quickly, improving their efficiency and service quality. Now, I’ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.4 billion, up 2.5% versus the prior year while base business revenues grew 3.8%. Organic base business revenues grew by 3.1%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 2.8% compared to the prior year reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.1% versus the second quarter of 2023 with acquisitions contributing 40 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 1.7% versus the prior year. Total revenue per requisition was up 1.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix, partially offset by the timing of certain value-based arrangements in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat this year and lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per req was up 2.4%. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Clinical base business revenues were up 5.1% while volumes grew 3.2%. This primarily reflects growth through our physician and hospital channels, which comprise approximately 90% of our total revenues, and excludes the impact of lower volumes primarily in our employer businesses providing workforce drug testing and employee population health services. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $355 million, or 14.8% of revenues, compared to $348 million, or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $398 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $389 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong growth in the base business, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues and wage increases. Reported EPS was $2.03 in the quarter compared to $2.05 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.35, versus $2.30 the prior year. Cash from operations was $514 million year-to-date through the second quarter versus $538 million in the prior year. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.58 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.77, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.00. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. Given the uncertainty around when the LifeLabs acquisition will close, we are not including this transaction in our updated 2024 guidance. However, in the first 12 months after closing the acquisition, we expect the transaction to generate approximately $710 million in annual revenues and to be slightly dilutive to GAAP EPS, due primarily to amortization of intangibles and other items, but approximately $0.10 to $0.15 accretive to adjusted EPS. These assumptions include the impact of expected debt financing to close the acquisition. With that said, the following are some key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our revenue guidance reflects the recently announced acquisitions of PathAI Diagnostics, Allina Health, and OhioHealth as well as the strength of our base business. The PathAI Diagnostics acquisition closed in June, while Allina Health and OhioHealth are expected to close in Q3. The revenue contribution from these acquisitions represents the majority of the increase in our updated revenue guidance. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters. Therefore, we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024, but do expect increasing profitability next year. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year, driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense expected to be approximately $190 million. This does not include interest expense related to debt financing for the LifeLabs acquisition. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. Finally, our operations were affected by the worldwide IT outage last week, which limited our ability to collect and process specimens on Friday and through the weekend. Our labs were processing specimens by Friday afternoon, and the rest of our operations, including patient service centers, were largely restored to normal by yesterday morning. At this point, we estimate the IT outage and a minor impact from hurricane Beryl in Texas earlier this month could amount to a roughly $0.06 to $0.08 headwind on our Q3 earnings. This is currently reflected in our updated full year guidance. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and base revenue growth across our core customer channels, due to strong commercial execution, innovative offerings and ongoing strength in healthcare utilization. We announced four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns and position us for growth in new geographic and service areas. We improved productivity as well as service levels and quality, through greater use of automation and AI. Finally, I’d like to personally thank my nearly 50,000 Quest colleagues for our strong performance this quarter, which is largely the result of the dedication, care and collaboration that they show patients, customers each and every single day. This commitment was exemplified by the tireless efforts of our teams to restore outstanding service for patients and customers this past weekend following the global IT outage. I’m proud to work with so many talented people committed to living our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. With that, we’d be happy to take your questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up question on volume. I believe you said the total base volume is up 1.7%. But if you exclude employer base, it's up 3.2%. Can you just give us more detail on what's happening in that business? Is it just the overall job market? And maybe if you can provide some like profitability versus staff position-based business versus the employer-based business and whether or not it was in line with your estimates? Then my second question just has to do around the Canadian acquisition. Can you just give us more details on that market? How is it different than the U.S.? Why you view it as attractive? Maybe some long-term growth revenue algorithms versus the U.S. business? Is it growing in line with the business? Is it higher growth? That would be great. Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yeah, good morning Ann. Let me start here. So, on the employer side, we have two principal businesses that serve employers. One is our Employee Drug Testing Business, second is our Employer Population Health business. There is a third business as you know called ExamOne that does health risk assessments for life insurance companies. Taken together, all three of those businesses showed meaningful declines in the quarter, and really largely represent the difference in the 3.2% that Sam referred too and the 1.7%. In the drug testing market, there's a couple of shifts going on. Number one, a lot of the job growth is still coming in the services industry, hotel workers, restaurant workers. A lot of those industries just have given up on drug testing. Other companies that still do drug testing, as you probably know, many have eliminated marijuana off the panel, so that has created some pressure. Then the final thing I'd tell you, is there's a shift going on in employee drug testing, where more companies are doing what we call on-site or oral testing, and if that test is positive, it eventually reflexes back to a central lab. But if it's a negative test, it's just an on-site screen and the employee passes and we don't get that work. On the Employee Population Health, we're just seeing companies not spend as much money on these wellness events that they've typically done in the past. Finally again, ExamOne, our life insurance business, that does risk assessments for life insurance. Just the life insurance policies, we saw a spike. During COVID people started to get life insurance again. Post-COVID, that negative trend has continued, which we were seeing actually pre-COVID. Now, let me turn to the Canada market for just a minute here. So look, there's a lot to like about the Canadian market. First of all, a population of roughly 41 million people. The population growth rate is actually faster than the U.S. The population growth there at about 1.1%. Here in the U.S., population growing less than 50 basis points. The aging of the population there as well is a good trend that we like and LifeLabs is really centered in two key markets, British Columbia and Ontario; Ontario being the biggest province in Canada, British Columbia being the second largest province. Collectively, those two provinces are over 50% or close to 50% of the Canadian population. We like the reimbursement model in Canada. It's steady. It's consistent. We think it will fill growth over the coming years. When we look at things like test per req, when we look at the types of testing done here in the U.S. versus Canada, we think there's opportunity to grow the types of testing that we bring into that market from an esoteric standpoint, from an advanced testing standpoint. So we feel great about entering the Canadian market. By the way, it's a market we know. We've served that market for many, many years as a reference provider. We've served LifeLabs, we've served other independent labs and hospital labs up in Canada. So we know the market, we're familiar with it, and we think it's a great opportunity for Quest Diagnostics.
Sam Samad: Maybe a couple of comments to add on the services businesses Ann, just to give you some financials behind them or at least some percentages. I mean, the Workforce Health Solutions businesses, Employer Population Health, and the Employer Solutions are less than 5% of our overall revenues. So just to give you a sense of bucketing of how much those businesses are. So they are not that material or not material to our overall revenues, but as Jim said, they have been impacted post-COVID somewhat significantly and with some of the market dynamics in the drug testing business, so they are impacting our growth rates. And then ExamOne is on top of that, but it's also impacted by some of the dynamics that Jim said coming out of COVID. So these businesses are down significantly year-over-year, but we don't expect further deterioration as we look forward. So there is a year-over-year impact, but we don't expect that to further amplify as we go forward.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Yes, the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks for taking my question. It's not usually your want to raise guidance by more than a beat, in any particular quarter. Yet you did, and now we find out there was actually from what appears to be a core, even a greater upside in the second half than what you had originally had, if you back out the impact of the strike and the hurricanes and the like, the IT issues, I mean. So, is that mostly driven just by core? Are you expecting margins to expand a little bit on a year-over-year basis more than what we saw in the second quarter? I guess, I just want to understand what's driving the enthusiasm for the second half improvements. You had the M&A stuff that you mentioned, but you said there wasn't a lot of contributions. So I'm guessing its core, but I'm wondering, is it expected volume? Is it expected mix? Is it expected cost to come in better? You know wage, labor, churn, that kind of thing.
Sam Samad: Yeah, so maybe I'll start Kevin, and Jim can add comments. First, let's kind of talk about the details in terms of what we shared. We said we're going to take up revenues by $100 million. We said we're going to take up EPS – and this is at the midpoint. We're going to take up EPS by $0.05 to $8.80 to $9. Within the $100 million that we talked about, the majority of that is really new M&A. So essentially M&A that we have signed, that we expect to close sometime between mid Q3 and the end of the year, and those reflect the M&A related to, or the transactions which are Allina Health, OhioHealth. We have some upside from PathAI as well, which we closed in Q2, but wasn't in our original guidance. So the revenue has a majority – the majority of the revenues is really driven by the M&A that we expect to close. The EPS increase is related to contribution from this M&A, although as we talked about in the prepared remarks, M&A ramps up in terms of profitability, so 2024, in the second half, very little contribution in terms of profitability from M&A. The remainder, I would say is contribution from the base business and some M&A, but little. And we are absorbing as you said, the impact of the IT outage, which is $0.06 to $0.08 in Q3 that we expect to, that we have now sized. This is preliminary. We'll get better detail as we go, but we are absorbing that impact. So, in terms of what's driving this improvement or the raise of EPS, we're basically continuing with a lot of the productivity work and the cost reductions that we have talked about. We have a lot of the AI and productivity improvements that Jim mentioned, a lot of the focus on improving margins. Importantly, base volumes continue to be very strong, and that's the biggest, I would say driver in terms of improved margins in the business. We continue to see base volumes be strong, utilization be strong. So really, that's the key driver. It's strength of volumes. It's continued productivity and cost improvements. It's also the fact that we have, as we've talked about many times over previous calls, a positive pricing and reimbursement environment, which is now stabilized, which is now flat to improving, as opposed to a negative price impact that we used to see in prior years.
Jim Davis: Yeah. Kevin, you probably saw a meaningful improvement in rev per rack in the quarter, and as Sam mentioned, within that rev per rack calculation, price per task, flat to last year. So the improvement is really coming in three areas. One, test per req continued to be very strong, north of four. Pre-COVID, that was a number that was south of four, it was in the threes. So that's a nice uptick, and that's coming from some of our advanced testing around allergy, tick testing, cardiometabolic testing, the neurology testing. And in that also is a mixed improvement that comes from some of those advanced tests. The final thing I'd say is, we saw again, strength in our overall Medicare Advantage and Medicare Book of Business. That pricing as you know, tends to be better than the average, and we also see more advanced tests coming on those requisitions versus our normal general health and wellness requisition. So we expect those trends to continue into the back half of the year, and that's contributing to the improvements that we're laying out there.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny : Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can just dive a little bit into the market. I know there's still some small moving pieces. I appreciate the color you've given so far on some of the employer testing. If I sort through all of the data points you have, the $3.2 billion base business volumes, (A) I just want to make sure I got that number correctly. And then (B) as you think about that number, how do you think about that in terms of translating where you see the health of broad-based market utilization versus where your competitive position is allowing you to take share? I guess just trying to understand fully where you see utilization baked into the implied second half guidance versus what we've seen over the last six to 12 months on a baseline business. Thanks so much.
Jim Davis: Yeah, again, the 3.2% represents the volume growth that we see through what we call our core or base business. And that means our physician business, our hospital reference business, our hospital PLS business, and embedded in that is both clinical, as well as anatomical pathology. So that entire book of business, which is about 90% of the company, the volumes grew 3.2%. Down from Q1, but the compare in Q2 was higher. But again, the 3.2%, we feel really good about that. Now that 3.2% volume growth again translated into 5.1% revenue growth, and that was coming again on the strength of test mix plus the test per req increase that we've been seeing year-over-year. So we feel good about that, again, going into the second half of the year. In terms of the implied growth in the second half of the year, it's in the 3.7% revenue range. So again, and that's just the base or organic, that's without acquisition. The timing of the close of these acquisitions we've set in Q3 with Allina and OhioHealth, we just don't know when in Q3, okay, so there's still some uncertainty about when these deals will officially close.
A - Sam Samad: And Mike, good morning. Maybe I'll add a couple of comments just in terms of utilization. I mean, as we have been mentioning, utilization continues to be strong. We've seen it strong in Q1. We've seen it strong in Q2. The year-over-year compare in Q2 was maybe a little bit tougher versus Q2 of 2023. We had some lapping of some wins, and just overall we saw more of a resurgence in the base business in Q2 of last year. But in terms of the dynamics there, we do believe that both in terms of – there's strong utilization out there. We think some of it is return to care, but also just general strength of utilization by just additional testing, and that's reflected in the higher number of tests per req that we're seeing, but also we are gaining share. We do believe that we are gaining share, and we're gaining share through some of these also outreach acquisitions that we're doing that help us direct more testing to Quest.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Thanks for the question guys. Sam, maybe just to expand on the utilization piece. Obviously, you guys have seen pretty nice elevated levels there the past couple of quarters. Can you just talk about what you are seeing and then what the guide implies in terms of how you're feeling about it? I know previously, the guide just assumed normal utilization. Obviously, it stayed a little bit elevated here. And just how you are thinking about the trend? Does it gradually come down to normal? We'd love to just discuss that a bit. Thanks.
Sam Samad: Yeah, I mean, as we've talked about before Patrick, we do expect eventually utilization to level off to essentially what we've talked about in terms of our long-term growth algorithm, which is roughly around 3%-ish in terms of organic growth. And then as we said before, in terms of long-term growth, we expect 1% to 2% contribution from acquisitions. So we still think longer term, if you are thinking over the next, let's say, longer period. I'm not going to necessarily bracket it with a time period, but I think that's the right algorithm to be thinking about. In terms of for us, our current guide, right now at the midpoint we're saying total growth is close to 3%, 3.1%. Our base revenue guide is somewhere around 5% for the full year. Our second half, if you think about second half, that's essentially on the base revenue growth. It's about a 5.3% second half growth. Now recall the 5.3% in the second half, and this is revenue. It includes as we said, the majority of the $100 million take up of the guide is acquisitions. So in that 5.3% second half, there is a significant portion which is acquisitions. So in effect, if you look at just organic as Jim just alluded to, it's actually a slightly slower second half than what we saw in the first half. So embedded in that is the expectation Patrick, that this utilization doesn't continue at the same level, but starts to slow down a bit. So again, total growth, first half base – or sorry, full year base is 5%, second half base is 5.3%, but within that there's some acquisition, so the second half is closer to something between 3.5% to 4% in terms of base.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
David Westenberg : Hi Noah. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to take it a little bit more of a long-term and look at the business here. How should we think about digital pathology, in light of the acquisition with PathAI? Can we see a more immediate path to incorporate it more broadly? If so, would there be cost savings in the intermediate term? And then, is there any maybe potential for pricing benefits given that a human plus AI kind of reading probably is a better outcome and so maybe would justify kind of a higher price and just as a background. Can you talk about maybe a broader framework for how much revenue of your business is pathology overall? Just anything you feel comfortable with. Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yeah, we said in the past, just on our revenue from anatomical pathology, that it was – and this was pre-PathAI diagnostics, said it was roughly a $500 million book of business. But we're excited about the digital pathology opportunity on numerous fronts. On the surface, unlike radiology, digital pathology does not naturally lower your cost, because you're actually, you still need to create the slide. Once you've created the slide, then you digitize the slide, okay, so there's actually an extra step in the process. Now here is where it creates productivity and as you said, we think better quality. Number one, we do anatomical pathology in over 20 locations across the country, because you want the pathologist to sit right near where you are preparing the slide, so that you don't have to move slides and vehicles and things like that. So we believe that it's going to – digital pathology will allow us to collapse the network of sites that actually do what we call the histology work or the preparation of the slides. So there will be cost savings when we collapse that network. Second is, it allows us to route the image to expert pathologists wherever they sit in the country. So if our guru for breast pathology sits on the west coast, you move those slides out there. If the prostate guru sits on the east coast, you move those slides there. So, and yes, we believe once you've digitized that slide, there's many companies out there that are working on algorithms. There's one or two that have been FDA approved that allow you to apply algorithmic analysis to the digital image in order to improve the quality of the read. In terms of reimbursement, we absolutely believe there's a strong case to be made for a higher reimbursement using these algorithms. The final thing I would tell you is that, with digital pathology, it opens up a realm of new just histology-only types of operations. Meaning, we will take on the histology work for a health system. They'll still keep the pathologists, but they'll shut down their histology operations. We'll do the slide preparation, digitize it, and send that back to the hospital pathologist for them still to do the reading. We call this a technical-only solution, and it's a solution that's starting to take off and the margins on the technical component of histology are quite good. So we're bullish on the overall market opportunity here.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a two-parter here. On value-based care contracts, you mentioned that you lacked some of the payments that were made through those contracts or relationships last year. I guess how much did that benefit you last year and how should we be thinking about modeling that on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Will those incentive payments or contributions, are they relatively one-time in nature? Is that something you'll be breaking out for us going forward and how material have those payments been, I guess, year-to-date? And then a second part of my question would just be more on the regulatory environment. Just what you are thinking in terms of PAMA and SALSA and your expectations into 2025 on that front? Thanks.
Jim Davis: All right, so let me start with your value-based care comment. I'll ask Sam to add some color, and then I'll come back and address PAMA and SALSA. So, on the value-based care, it made positive contributions in the second quarter of this year. They just weren't bigger than the second quarter of last year. Last year we had a meaningful gain. We acknowledged that last second quarter. Again, this year it was positive, but the delta between last year and this year was a headwind for us. It is very difficult for us to give you guidance on how to model these things. There's really two principal components to these value-based payments. One is from shared savings from acquisitions, and those are lumpy. They are based on the acquisitions they do. And in some cases, payments can be six months post-deal closure. In some cases it could be a year post-deal closure. It just depends on the contract. The other type of value-based incentive payment that we have with some of our payers is around the movement of requisitions from high-priced, either out-of-network laboratories or high-priced health system laboratories. And again, that could be a once-a-year true-up, and depending on when we sign that contract, it could be in June, it could be in January, it could be in April, so very, very hard to model these things. So Sam, any other color on this.
A - Sam Samad: I think you've really captured it, Jim. The key thing there Erin is, it's difficult to give you a sense as to how the pacing is going to be. We’ve always said these are lumpy and sometimes there's also accounting nuances on these, where if it's a shared service, shared savings commitment for instance, we might accrue for that shared savings as if we're not going to achieve it, but then when we do achieve it, we have to release that accrual so to speak, and get a benefit in that quarter. Suffice it to say that these continue to be a positive for us in terms of our overall pricing in Q2 of 2024. It was a pricing or a positive benefit for us in the quarter, but on a year-over-year base, we had a significant benefit in Q2, 2023. So it impacted us negatively in terms of total revenues on a year-over-year basis. So I think everything that Jim said stands in terms of the difficulty of giving you a modeling algorithm for these. And then PAMA, Jim, did you want to comment?
Jim Davis: Yeah, in terms of PAMA in SALSA, while we continue to, we and our trade association and other independent labs continue to push the case for SALSA, we acknowledge it's going to be difficult to get that through in a year with an election year, especially now given many of the changes that occurred in the last week. Having said that, we will continue to push very hard for another one-year delay in PAMA. The recent CBO scoring on this was actually bigger than it was last year. They projected it would save the government over $3 billion. And in addition, the committee in the House that overlooks this is looking for a pay for program to pay for continued telehealth benefits. So this becomes a really nice pay for program that can satisfy the requirement to fund the telehealth. So we're confident that at a minimum that would be a one-year delay in PAMA, and hopefully we can get this done and figure it out in the October-November timeframe as opposed to waiting for the December timeframe like we've seen in the past.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jeffries. Your line is open, sir.
Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe Sam, as I think about your comments on Haystack, I understand maintaining the drag guidance for this year. But how are you thinking about the ramp on that as we think about 2025 and given some of the announcements you've made on new partnerships there? So just curious how we should be thinking about the development and the ramp of Haystack going forward? Thanks.
A - Jim Davis: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Brian. So as we said in the prepared remarks, Haystack dilution this year will be somewhere in the $0.35 to $0.40 range, which is about a $0.20 increase in terms of dilution from prior year. For 2025 Brian, the way we see it is, it's still going to be dilutive, but it's going to be less dilutive than we see in 2024, because we will start to recognize revenues on the assay as we launch later this year. In 2026, we expect this – we expect Haystack to be slightly accretive. And we expect by the end of 2025 also to get to a positive return on invested capital from this acquisition. In terms of all the things that we've seen, the early launch has been really successful. We've had a very, very high interest in terms of number of key thought leaders and cancer centers that have signed up for this. So everything that we see today is really encouraging. And you touched on the partnerships that we've made as well. We continue to sign new partnerships in terms of cancer centers that are, or companies that are partnering with us to evaluate the use of the assay and MRD in a specific type of cancer. So really excited about the upcoming launch. I think the early launch has been very positive, and hopefully this gives you a sense as to the, you know the financial impact in terms of accretion dilution.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Since you last reported the LDT rule that came out, can you maybe just talk about what the impact is there? I heard your comments on PAMA and SALSA, but anything else on the regulatory front that we should be aware of?
Jim Davis: Yeah, thanks Lisa. So as you know, our trade association filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Texas, District Court of Texas, and work by outside counsel that the trade association has retained. It continues – we expect movement in the case in the latter part of this year, November, December, and probably into January of next year. Having said that, the rule is in place. We are running the company and operating the company with the rule in place. There's certain requirements that we need to have in place by May of next year, including a complaint handling unit up and running, as well as the ability to report adverse events. And these capabilities, some of which we had in the company, some of which we have to add are ongoing as we speak. We continue, we've launched training for the organization, in particular our R&D teams, our product marketing teams around design controls. And again, we're living with the rule and implementing things for the directive of the FDA. We've said this year, it's not going to add a material cost into the business, but we continue to evaluate what we need to be fully compliant, especially if the lawsuit is not successful.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin : Hey. Thanks for taking the question guys. I'm going to stay on the regulatory side. It's still fairly recent, but we had a couple of questions coming from investors on Chevron deference, and the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Chevron to outshine what could mean for deregulation. It's still kind of a hypothetical I think, but just curious what’s your take on that, given your place in the industry.
Jim Davis: Well, it certainly doesn't hurt the case that we believe is in front of, again, the Federal District Court in Texas. I'm not a legal expert by any means, but as you know, look, Congress is the one that sets the operating parameters for various departments that exist like the FDA. We believe what Congress authorized the FDA to do, is to regulate medical devices. Congress also authorized the CLIA Act of 1988 that talked about the regulation of clinical laboratories. So we believe it's very clear what Congress intended. Obviously, others don't see it that way, but we do believe that yes, what has come out of the Supreme Court recently is favorable and clearly dictates what should occur within the four walls of regulatory bodies.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir.
Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Either for Sam or for Jim, I was wondering if you could give an update on what you're seeing in terms of cost trends, how are wage costs trending, an update on turnover. And sorry if I missed this Sam, what's the full year margin target? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yeah, so from a wage standpoint, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected wage increases to be in that 3% to 4% range. We're still operating within that 3% to 4%, so we're comfortable with that estimate for the back half of the year that it'll play out in that range. In terms of turnover, last year all-in for our frontline physicians, patient services, logistics, specimen processing, our laboratory workers, we were north of 20%. In the first quarter we came down below 20% into the mid-18s, and we kind of hung there in the second quarter. So we feel good that generally you can see an uptick sometimes after your first quarter, after bonus payments and things like that, but we've maintained a relatively flat position. We obviously have some hot spots around the country in certain job categories that tend to be competitive-related, either with health systems or with other industries. So we address those hot spots and we expect to make meaningful improvements in the back half of this year.
Sam Samad: Yeah, and for a margin target Jack, we didn't give one, so you didn't miss it. But we did say that operating margins are expected to be up year-over-year, which is what we had shared also on the Q1 call.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.
Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you, just on the balance sheet and the upcoming debt maturities. Anything that you can sort of share in terms of your expectations for timing or interest costs associated with those refinancing? And I guess just related to that, any color that you can provide on the debt assumptions for the LifeLabs acquisition. Thanks.
Sam Samad: Sure, Andrew, and good morning. So, let's start with the LifeLabs. What we are assuming, I mean, I shared in the prepared remarks that we expect the acquisition. First of all, we're not expecting LifeLabs to close this year, at least in our guidance assumptions. It could, but we're not assuming it's in guidance. But for 2025 it's a $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion, or at least in its first year, let's call it that. It's $0.10 to $0.15. We're assuming that it's funded by a combination of debt and cash. But within that assumption of $0.10 to $1.15 is that 75% of that purchase price is funded with debt. So the roughly $1 billion purchase price, 75% of it is debt funded, which is what drives the $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in the first year. In terms of just broadly on debt assumptions and liquidity, etcetera, I think here you talked about balance sheet assumptions. Listen, a lot of that is going to depend on market conditions and depend on the timing of the close of some of these acquisitions, not just LifeLabs, primarily LifeLabs, but also we have OhioHealth, Allina Health. We also closed PathAI in June. So as we've been talking about, we've had a busy M&A pipeline and it's starting to come to fruition. So we're going to evaluate market conditions. We've got the flexibility to access the capital markets. We've got very strong short term liquidity through the access to our facilities. But our goal continues to be to target a 2.5x to 3x leverage ratio, that's our goal. There could be some slight tip above that higher end of 3x, but then we expect to de-lever back to somewhere within that 2.5x to 3x in short time, given the growth and the accretion from these acquisitions. So again, no specific debt number right now, but we'll keep you posted as we get more timing on the closes of these acquisitions.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: The next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. A multi-part question here. How are volumes looking at from your preferred network customers versus everyone else? Looking at both the physician market and the hospital market, are you losing, gaining, or maintaining share? Any quantification of any of those would be helpful?
Jim Davis: Okay. So, on volume from our payers with preferred arrangements. The volume with several and of them Patrick, is higher. Now, some of that can be also driven by Medicare Advantage, the various size of the Medicare Advantage books of business. But in general, when we operate within these preferred networks where we have incentives in place to move, share from out-of-network labs, high-priced health systems, we definitely see benefits. In terms of market share statistics around our physician book of business and our health system book of business, it's hard to tell, right. There's just not great industry reports that talk about that. But I can tell you, when we said that that book of business was up 5.1% from a revenue standpoint, our physician growing faster than that, health system growing slightly lower than that, but still they are growing in ranges that are significantly above what we saw from a pre-COVID standpoint. So that leads us to believe, and also just based on the number of new wins with large physician groups, the number of new wins in our reference book of business, it leads us to believe that, yes, we are picking up share in this industry. Much of that share, we believe, is coming from health systems that potentially aren't as aggressive on some of that outreach book of business, from specialty labs and also from small, very small little regional labs.
Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question.
Operator: We have time for one last question, and that is from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephanie Davis : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. I was just curious if there's anything that's changed either the environment or maybe in strategy that had this pick up in M&A so much this year. And how sustainable is this or how much of this is to kind of strike them while the iron is hot? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yeah, no change in the strategy at all Stephanie. And as we've been saying for many quarters in a row, the M&A funnel is full. Now, we don't go into a year planning on getting four deals announced in one quarter. It just, in fact, you would prefer to space these out a little bit, but there's always somebody on the other end that you are negotiating with, and these things sometimes take time. So, look, we're really excited about all of these. Allina Health in Minneapolis, it represents a market where the independent labs basically have really, really low share in that market space, so really excited about the Minneapolis marketplace. We're also very excited about Columbus, Ohio, dominated by two health systems, very difficult for independent labs to operate there, and so this gives us a substantial foothold within that Columbus marketplace. Obviously excited about the Canadian marketplace as we talked, and again, PathAI represents both, a nice opportunity in the Memphis marketplace itself, where we believe we can grow our book of business there. As well, it doesn't really matter where that lab is located, because a lot of the work is done digitally, so it accepts specimens from all over the country. I would tell you that there's still opportunities within the funnel. The emphasis continues to be on these outreach tuck-in deals. It continues to be in, to focus in markets where our share position or access to independent labs is waning, and that's where our focus will be in the second half of this year.
Sam Samad: One other thing I'd add, Stephanie, is all of these acquisitions that we announced meet our criteria. They basically hit the mark on all of the criteria that we have. Accretive in the first year, they meet our return on invested capital threshold. They meet our MPV criteria. So again, the activity would depend also that these acquisitions are going to hit our profitability criteria and our heroic hurdle rate, and they do.
Jim Davis: Okay, so that concludes our call today. We really appreciate everybody joining. Thanks for your support, and have a great week ahead.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered nearly 6% base business revenue growth, continuing the strong momentum of recent quarters. We also grew total revenues for the first time since the height of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Our strong commercial focus on physicians and hospitals, combined with our broad health plan access, enabled us to take advantage of sustained high rates of healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. Our investments in advanced diagnostics also enabled double-digit growth within multiple key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, and advanced cardiometabolic health. In addition, our Invigorate initiative, which includes ongoing investments in automation and AI, continued to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. Given the strength of our business, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Before turning to highlights from the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the FDA's proposed rule to regulate laboratory-developed testing services. We still encourage the administration to withdraw the proposed rule and engage in advancing appropriate legislation that preserves the critical role of laboratory diagnostics. We are disappointed that the FDA continues to move forward with this regulation, which we believe, if enacted, will compromise patient access to critical lab testing, slow diagnostic innovation, and add unnecessary healthcare costs. We also believe that the rule raises serious legal issues, including that the FDA lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate these services. While we will be prepared to comply with the rule, we will continue to work with our trade association, ACLA, on potential next steps. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the first quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller, independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we've made in each of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered high single-digit based business revenue growth driven by sustained high healthcare utilization, overall market growth and share gains. This growth also reflects new customer wins and our strengthening relationships with physician practices of all sizes, including large multi-specialty physician groups and those owned by large retailers. A significant driver of our success in the physician channel is our broad health plan access, as approximately 90% of health plan members in the U.S. have access to laboratory services at Quest Diagnostics. Health Plans value our size, scale, and innovation. We partner closely with them to reduce laboratory costs through programs that redirect volume from hospital outreach labs and out-of-network labs, which often charge significantly higher prices than we do, raising healthcare costs for patients and employers. We also remain disciplined in our pricing strategy as we increase our investments in improving the customer experience, such as through digital platform enhancements and adjustments to Frontline Pay. As we highlighted previously, we successfully renegotiated our large health plan contracts that were up for renewal last year. In addition, more than 50% of our health plan revenues now have some type of value-based incentive. In Physician Services, our recent acquisition of Lenco, an independent lab in New York, also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our M&A pipeline continues to be robust, and we are making progress with several promising opportunities. In Hospital Lab Services, we grew base business revenues by mid-single digits. Hospital reference testing, in particular, continued to grow faster than pre-pandemic trends, maintaining the momentum from last year. Hospitals are sending us more reference testing, largely because of our innovation, our quality, and our value. They also face persistent challenges with staffing certain roles in specialized fields like histology, microbiology, and cytotechnology, which we can more easily fill with our talent and our technology. In general, as hospitals face both staffing and cost challenges, they continue to reevaluate their lab strategies. Additionally, as the cost of capital continues to rise, some are revisiting their investment priorities and are directing more capital into other clinical areas that generate better returns. Quest provides hospitals with a range of ways to help optimize lab operations, whether through reference testing, savings and efficiencies through professional lab services, or access to capital by selling their outreach programs. Many hospitals and health system leaders are approaching us with a heightened sense of urgency for help with their lab strategies. As a result, our pipeline of both PLS and outreach opportunities remains very strong. Consumer-initiated testing revenues grew double digits, while base business revenues nearly doubled, building on the gains that we delivered last year from our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com. Some of our most popular test categories included general health panels, STDs, and tuberculosis testing. We also continue to expand our test menu, such as with our launch of PFAS testing for assessing potential exposure to dangerous forever chemicals, and are extending our reach through various channel partners. In Advanced Diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit revenue growth within several key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Growth in brain health was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which includes our Quest AD-Detect blood tests for early risk assessment of Alzheimer's disease and our CSF Tests for diagnosing and monitoring. We are launching our Quest AD-Detect pTau-217 blood test to providers this week, and we intend to add additional biomarkers this year to further expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we completed the validation of our Haystack MRD test in March and have oversubscribed our Haystack MRD Early Experience Program with nearly 20 leading cancer institutions as participants. The Early Experience Program is the final step to prepare for our broad national launch of the clinical test later this year. We are also excited about the opportunities in early blood-based cancer screening. This quarter, our Lewisville, Texas site received the first specimens for the PROMIS Clinical Trial on a liquid biopsy screening test for colorectal cancer from our partner, Universal DX. We look forward to supporting Universal's efforts to gain U.S. regulatory approval for this test. Lastly, our STEP500 somatic tumor sequencing service, which helps providers select therapy for late-stage cancers based on tumor mutation profiles, is generating interest from large cancer centers. Our investments in cancer screening, treatment selection, and monitoring are positioning us to be a leader in the MRD space and other fast-growth molecular genomics and oncology markets. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we continued to deploy automation and AI to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we made progress creating what we term a digital front door, which will use AI in our website and service center kiosks to answer basic questions from patients, reducing workload on Phlebotomist and calls to our customer service team. We also recently automated elements of the specimen preparation process in several labs and expect to deploy these systems across other sites in 2024. These systems make our front-end operations more efficient and improve quality while also freeing our employees to focus on other value-added work. Finally, I'd like to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering a superior customer experience. Our industry just celebrated Lab Week, which reminds us of the key role labs play at the heart of healthcare. I'm proud that our nearly 50,000 employees bring Quest's purpose to life every day. Working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.37 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year, while base business revenues grew nearly 6%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 1.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 60 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 3.3% versus the prior year, despite the impact of severe weather in the first two weeks of January. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume growth by approximately 30 basis points. Revenue per requisition was up slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per rec was up 2.6% due to an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $300 million, or 12.7% of revenues, compared to $305 million, or 13.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $350 million or 15% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income was relatively consistent versus the prior year due to strong growth in the base business, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, and higher benefit costs. Reported EPS was $1.72 in the quarter compared to $1.78 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04, flat versus the prior year. Cash from operations was $154 million in the first quarter versus $94 million in the prior year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we repaid $300 million of senior notes which matured on April 1st. Turning to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.4 billion and $9.48 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.82, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.72 to $8.97. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are some key assumptions underlying our guidance to consider as you update your models. COVID-19 testing revenues to decline approximately $175 million for the full year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only includes acquisitions that have been announced or closed to-date. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense to be approximately $190 million. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. While we are only one quarter into the year, given the strong volume trends in Q1, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, which more than offsets the $0.05 to $0.07 headwind we experienced from weather in January. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong revenue growth across our core customer channels, physicians, hospitals, and consumers, building on trends from 2023. Our strong customer relationships, broad health plan access, and investments in advanced diagnostics are enabling us to take advantage of sustained high healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. We are steadily improving productivity as well as service levels and quality, giving us confidence in improved profitability in 2024. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open, sir.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to focus on the margins Sam. Obviously, a big story throughout last year. Nice to see them come in a little bit better than expected this quarter. Can you talk about the moving pieces? It sounds like Haystack was as expected in terms of the dilution for the year. You are kind of maintaining that expectation. But can you talk about the better performance this quarter and then expectations as we work our way through the year, the right way to think about the cadence there? I just want to make sure we have that metric kind of ironed out as we think about the progress as we work our way through 2024 here.
Jim Davis : Yeah, sure Patrick, and good morning. So maybe the best way to look at it is think about it in terms of year-over-year. We were 14.8% operating margins in Q1 of this year compared to 15% last year. So some moving parts for you to consider and think about, because you can look at this in many different ways. But versus last year, obviously a big headwind in terms of COVID, both in terms of volumes, but also price. We had $90 million less COVID this quarter versus last year same quarter, at a much lower price as well, because we were getting reimbursed at $100 price back then. If you think about other smaller headwinds, I mean Haystack as you said, we still expect it to be $0.20 incremental dilution versus last year for the full year, well you saw that in Q1. But then offsetting these headwinds, the biggest one being COVID, was base volume growth and productivity improvement. So we actually offset almost the majority of the COVID headwind through base improvement in terms of margins. The consumer-initiated testing business also expanded operating margins as well. We continue to see great momentum in that business and good improvement in profitability. Our base gross margins actually improved quite significantly from Q1 of last year, so very encouraged by the start that we've had and the momentum that we see going forward. In terms of cadence, I think to answer your second question, it's I'd say normal seasonality that you would expect going forward. A step up in Q2 in terms of operating margins, maybe consistent operating margins to Q2 and Q3, and then a step down in Q4, which is, I would say normal pre-COVID seasonality for us. Operator, next question.
Operator: Yes. The next question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Great, thanks. Good morning. So you beat consensus by 11%, but only raised EPS by 1% – I mean, I'm sorry 1%. Can you tell us what Q1 came in versus your internal expectations? And should we view that differential as conservatism, or is it something else we should consider as we model? Thanks.
Sam Samad : So let me start, Ann. Thank you for the question by the way. This is Sam, and Jim if you want to add anything as well, by all means. We beat in Q1, both in terms of versus external expectations, but also versus our own internal expectations. So we came in better. We had called out at the beginning of the year on the Q4 earnings call that we expect to see a $0.05 to $0.07 headwind from weather, in terms of EPS headwind from weather. That was at the time driven by the fact that really the first two weeks, three weeks of January were quite tough for us in terms of utilization and in terms of weather. We offset a significant portion of that. I mean, you heard on the prepared remarks that we had a 30 basis point headwind impact as a result of weather, but really we offset most of the headwinds in terms of the EPS impact. So the $0.05 to $0.07, largely we feel good that that's behind us and that's essentially taken off the table. So we felt comfortable increasing our EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint. Now, we're only in the second quarter here. We still have three quarters to go. Utilization was really strong, especially base business utilization in the first quarter. We're expecting in the next three quarters that we go back to, I would say, more normal utilization, not what we saw in Q1. So that's what our EPS range is also driven by. But I would say very pleased with the beat that we had in Q1 and taking the weather headwind off the table.
Jim Davis : Yeah. The only thing I'd add Ann, is that the volume growth was broad-based. We saw it across all physician channels and we saw it in health systems as well. So it did beat our internal expectations after a slow start in January. It came back very nicely in February and March and we finished strong.
Ann Hynes : Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask a little bit about LDT. I'm sure you’re hoping that the ruling was going to come out before you reported, so that you can actually address it. But maybe talk a little bit, now that you've had some time to go over the initial proposal and maybe what you are expecting in the final proposal? Maybe can you let us know about the scope of the tests that you think are going to be included, and any sort of financial implications that you might have for fiscal ‘24? Did it change the way you were guiding? Is there anything in the guidance for this? And maybe how you think it plays out with regards to, are you going to try to get an injunction or anything like that through an ACLA?
Jim Davis : Yeah. So thanks, Kevin. So look, we don't know what the final rule is yet. We've all seen the proposed rule. It largely follows 21 CFR Part 820, which is the regulated device code. So we're preparing for it, but let me just tell you, look, we start with a strong quality management system and a very strong quality organization in Quest Diagnostics today. As you know we follow the CLIA guidelines. CLIA was implemented in 1988. It's a very robust and strict set of guidelines that we follow, and we feel good about that. I would also tell you that myself and many other people in Quest Diagnostics have come from regulated device manufacturing companies in the healthcare space, so we know what to do, we know how to do it. Certainly there's gaps between what CLIA recommends and what 21 CFR recommends, and we'll address those gaps once we know what the final rule is, but we'll be prepared. There's not going to be any impact on earnings or EPS here in 2024. As you know the timeframe laid out was a three to four year timeframe. So we'll address this in a thoughtful way. We'll be prepared, and we've got the confidence and quality organization in place to do it.
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Taji Phillips : Good morning. You've got Taji on for Brian. Thank you for taking my question. So first, just on the M&A contribution, obviously called out 60 basis points, contribution to total volume. Just curious, is the 50 basis point expectation for the full year contribution to revenue still stand? Thank you.
Jim Davis : Well, if we don't do any other acquisitions this year, then yes, the 50 basis point trend will continue for the following quarters. But, as we mentioned in the script, our funnel is good, it's robust and we would expect to close some additional transactions this year. But timing is involved and these things do take time. We're cautiously optimistic.
Sam Samad : Yeah, just to be clear, our consistent approach is always going to be, that we will include in the guidance that we provide only the things that have been announced and our carryover acquisitions. So, anything that we haven't announced will not be included in our guidance. To Jim's point, if we do close any other transactions, we will include them in our guidance perspective going forwarded.
Operator: The next question will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask on just the broader advanced diagnostic segment. How that's tracking relative to kind of internal expectations. You've made advances in areas like Alzheimer's, for instance and now you did Haystack acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about potential holes in your offering that you see as opportunities? And then on the Haystack front, just what's the next catalyst on that front? Thanks.
Jim Davis : Yeah. So, from an advanced diagnostic standpoint, it certainly met and even exceeded our expectations here in the quarter. So, let me talk about brain health first. The uptake of our AB 42/40 test, which is a blood-based test for amyloid plaque has again exceeded expectations. We're really, really pleased with how that test is doing. We announced yesterday in a press release that we've added a p-tau217. We had already introduced p-tau181. So we feel like the brain health blood-based portfolio is in great shape. The CSS side of the portfolio continues to do well as well. On the women's healthcare side, prenatal genetics and carrier screening are doing very well. We continue to see double-digit growth there. With respect to Haystack, as you know, it's still pre-revenue, but we are about to embark on what we call our early experience program. We said in the script that we were oversubscribed. We saw it somewhere between 15 and 20 partners to start the program with, and we filled that up a lot more quickly than we thought and had to cut it off at 20 customers. So, feel good about that. We're going to run that early experience program for the next several months, which will position us for a broader national launch later in the quarter. So, feeling good about the contribution of advanced diagnostics across our portfolio of tests.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe, Sam, if I can turn back to the guidance you talked about, the dynamics of utilization and the expectation that it will be a slightly more normal environment. As you think about that, how does that factor into your expectations for organic volume, not only on the total number, but also on mix and how that...
Sam Samad: Hey, Mike, sorry. We kind of lost you for two seconds there. Can you please repeat the question? Because I missed a portion of it.
Michael Cherny : Is this better?
Sam Samad: Yes, this is much better. Thank you.
Michael Cherny : Okay, I'm going to try to fix my headset after this. Apologize for that. So, it's a question just on the dynamics of what's ingrained in the organic volume expectations, is included both from a normalization of the market, but also a mixed perspective and how that factors into your expectations for margin expansion, and where are the push and pull points that will allow you to make sure you hit the margin expansion versus areas that you could potentially fall short?
Sam Samad : Yeah, I can start, and by all means, Jim you can add some color as well. I think as Jim talked about earlier, Mike, we've got some areas within advanced diagnostics that are growing in the double digits, which really helps us from growing some of the key tests that we have in that portfolio, and also helps us from profitability standpoint as well. But overall base volumes, we grew in revenues 5.7%, grew less than that in volumes in Q1. Our expectation is that we're growing in the sort of close to mid-single digits, maybe slightly below that in terms of volumes, and that drives a lot of productivity and improvement in terms of our margins as we look forward. So, both in terms of mix and some of these advanced diagnostics tests that we have, but also in terms of volume growth overall for the remaining three quarters, we expect that to drive an improvement in terms of productivity. Now remember, we are – in the next three quarters, we're not assuming that we continue at the same level and same rate of whether you call it base revenue growth and maybe to some extent base clinical volume growth. We do expect that some of this – as utilization starts to come down and normalize. Maybe that's a conservative assumption, not sure, but at this point, we're more comfortable saying that it's going to be, volume growth is going to be closer to that, just slightly lower than mid-single digits. Jim, anything you would add there?
Jim Davis : Yeah, I would just say, the mix in the quarter was really good. On a total basis, so all in, even with COVID we still had 10 basis points of growth from a rev-per-rec standpoint, pricing relatively flat. So it suggests that test-pa rec and test-mix were really, really strong. Remember, that offset, as Sam said in the script, $90 million worth of COVID decline. COVID that last year was at $100 per test. So, we completely offset that from a mix standpoint and still saw growth in rev-per-rec. So, really happy with the mix that we saw in the quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could unpack the core growth a little bit more. So, nearly 6% that was a 3% beat versus what I was looking for. Historically, the lab has been a pretty steady business. So, to post a beat like this, it's pretty notable. Can you just lay out the factors for why maybe outside of core utilization growth came in a lot stronger in the quarter? Any thoughts on share gains? Was that a dynamic? Thanks.
Jim Davis : I think it's all of the above, Jack. Certainly, the utilization remains strong, consistent with what we've seen in the last three or four quarters. But, we also said that, yeah, we think we're picking up share. We closed several large transactions with two integrated large physician groups in the quarter. Our core physician volume growth was strong. Our hospital reference growth was strong. Our PLS volume relatively strong in the quarter. So, that suggests utilization in hospitals was also up, and our pathology business contributing as well to growth. So, we see it across all physician types, all physician channels, retailers, as well as these large physician groups. It's a combination of utilization plus share gain.
Sam Samad : Yeah, and Jack, this is Sam. I'll mention one other thing as well. If you're looking at overall base business growth, I mean, the Quest Health Consumer-Initiated Testing business as well was a very good strength and tailwind in the quarter. Basically, that base business excluding COVID almost doubled in the quarter – year-over-year.
Operator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Maybe a slight two-parter for me. First just to pick up Sam, what you were just saying about the consumer business. Can you talk about when you sort of think about, how you think about the margin progression of that and sort of like what your expectations are for that to get more towards the corporate average? And then secondarily, could you just comment on the continued labor environment? How are you seeing sort of wages and turnover versus the prior quarter? Thank you.
Sam Samad : Yeah. Hey, I'll address both. So the margins on our consumer business are consistent with the margins in the overall business. So, it's right there. It's at the meeting for the company and it continued to improve all last year and so feel good about that. In terms of the labor environment, we definitely saw a tick down or a tick up, let's just say, in our retention rates. Not yet back to pre-COVID levels, but below in the high teens, below the 20% threshold that we were running at last year. So, we feel good about that. We saw a downward tick in logistics attrition, our specimen processing. It was across the board. All front-line jobs improved in the quarter and feel good about the direction that that's moving in.
Operator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. In your prepared comments, you talked about 50% of health plans now having some type of value-based care arrangement. Can you maybe just give us an example of what that looks like and talk about what that means to the margin?
Jim Davis : Yeah. So we call it value-based incentives is what we're talking about here. Generally there is two types. So, one is related to acquisitions. So when we acquire an outreach book of business, and let's say the health plan was paying that health system 200% to 300% of Medicare, it is not going to come down to the rates that we are contracted with that health plan with on day one. It will step down over time. In fact, there's – again, since it doesn't step right down to our rate, we're getting paid a higher price for that work over some period of time. The second incentive types are broad-based or types of incentives are really related to volume movement. So, movement of high-priced requisitions from health system laboratories or from out-of-network laboratories into Quest Diagnostics. In essence, you're getting paid for share gains at that health plan that are tied to share gains coming from, moving those requisitions from, again, health systems and out-of-network labs. So, really those are the two types of value incentives that we get.
Lisa Gill : Just to confirm, there's no impact from the change cyber-attack at all on Quest in the quarter?
Jim Davis : No, less than 2% of our requisitions were ever moving through those pipes from an adjudication standpoint. There's somewhere between a $15 million and $20 million cash impact, but no revenue impact in the quarter.
Sam Samad : And just to be clear, the cash impact is really a delay, not necessarily any impact to revenue.
Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thanks for the comment.
Operator: This question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line has opened, sir.
Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to follow up on an earlier point you touched on, the COVID headwind that you overcame in the quarter and just how to think about price for the rest of the year. So as you said, impressive that you saw revenue for requisition growth, despite some of that headwind. How should we think about that through the rest of the year? I mean, and again, that's kind of a two-parter in terms of COVID headwinds and fading as you go through the year and then the pricing benefit. You had some major health plan renegotiation that concluded last year. Is that what's driving some of that growth and anything else in that arena that we should be thinking of for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Jim Davis : Yeah, so let me start and then I'll let Sam make some comments. So, remember, in the rev-rec calculation, there's multiple moving parts here. The first one is pure price. We said it was flat in the quarter and we expected to be flattish for the rest of the year. We also said in the rev-rec calculation is test-per-rec – test-per-rec, test-mix, and then payer-mix. Test-per-rec, positive in the quarter, we expect that to continue. Test-mix was favorable in the quarter. We expect that to continue. So all told, we like the trend that we saw in the first quarter. Now, there's always puts and takes as we move through each quarter and, we'll have to see how it plays out. But Sam, do you?
Sam Samad: Yeah, I mean, I'll add maybe a couple of things. First of all, the COVID point, Michael, COVID is not really material for the rest of the year. We said for the full year, it's going to be a $175 million decline. We've had $90 million of that decline happen in Q1. So, the biggest impact really was going to be felt in Q1. But yeah, there is a price impact related to it, given the fact that – a small, minor price impact, actually, because the price went down middle of May last year. So really it's a minor price impact. Then just a little bit of color on the pricing dynamics. As Jim said, it's flattish for the full year in terms of price impact. If you look at the ingredients within that, the health plans, we expect them to be, modestly up in terms of price. The health systems is a negative impact in terms of price. Then we have some other businesses where we've had some price increases that helps. So overall, I think the net neutral in terms of price impact for the year.
Michael Ryskin : Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You touched a bit on the automation opportunity in your centers in your prepared remarks. So I was hoping you could help us tease out what the mix of the cost structure looks like in the centers. How should we think about the Phlebotomy talent that would be difficult to improve with AI solutions, versus how much of that cost is more admin or front desk and could have that AI opportunity coming up?
Jim Davis: Well, Stephanie, we've always said that about 50% of the cost structure in the company is wages, labor and within the laboratories, it's obviously higher than that. Within the Phlebotomy, it's mostly a people expense, although there's supplies and rent for our patient service centers. I would say in the laboratories, much of the automation efforts continue in the specimen processing area, what we call sorting, aliquoting, pouring off tubes of urine, and things like that. That's where our automation efforts continue to pay dividends for us. On the Phlebotomy side, as I mentioned, yes, it's a highly labor-intensive operation. Now, in a typical 10 to 12 minute draw time, there's still probably five to six minutes of that time doing manual paperwork, computer entry type of stuff. The biggest opportunity there to improve that is still the movement from paper requisitions to electronic requisitions. What still comes into our patient service center today is 35% to 45% paper that we end up having to input that information into our Quest system. So we work back through the physician offices that send us that paper and try to convert that. I would tell you also, we're working on some other kits that could allow for some self-draw. So these are early stages, early stage development. But, we continue to work on some other things that should make our Phlebotomy staff even more productive.
Operator: And our final question.
Stephanie Davis : Thank you.
Operator: Our final question of today, will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just following up on some of the questions related to advanced diagnostics from earlier. I guess it's been about a year since you guys announced that Haystack acquisition. So, can you maybe just talk about how your views on the MRD segment or that asset in particular may have evolved since then? I know you mentioned no change in dilution or spending related to it this year, but how so we'll be thinking about potential additional investments here in the future to drag some of those share wins. Thanks.
Jim Davis : Andrew, our thesis hasn't changed at all on the Haystack acquisition. The MRD market continues to grow by our estimates strong double digits. I mean, there's one primary competitor in that space today that is doing very, very well with the test and making inroads in the market, and we applaud them and they're doing terrific. So, we think having a second, third credible offering in the marketplace that has a very, very, good basis for competition, very strong and very low limits of detection. So, feel good about that test. We still feel great about the investment and where this market is going. We're going to build on that. We've launched our STEP500, assay as well that allows cancer doctors, medical oncologists to get advice from a treatment planning therapy – therapy planning standpoint. So we feel good about that. We like, by the way, on Haystack it's a tumor-informed test. Again, we feel good about the technology. As we mentioned earlier, we've signed up 20 pre-launch customers for this early experience program. These are a broad base set of customers from community-based oncologists to academic medical centers. So, we like the mix of customers that have come to us right away for this. Once we wrap this early experience program up, we'll be launching on a national basis later this year.
Sam Samad : Andrew, just to add, this is Sam from a dilution standpoint. So our expectations this year have not changed. It's still in total 35% dilution, which is $0.20 of incremental dilution versus last year. For next year, we expect less dilution from Haystack. So on a year-over-year basis, it's actually a tailwind, and then we expect to be basically to start being neutral to a creative as we look towards ‘26. So, nothing has changed from a dilution or financial expectations, and we're really thrilled about the interest in the early experience program that Jim referenced.
Operator: And that was the final question.
Jim Davis : All right, thanks, operator. And thanks again for joining our call today. We really appreciate your continued support. Have a good day, everyone.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I’d now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. For the full-year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business, in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top-line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our invigorate goal, which helped us to offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth, while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the saving access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA. Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab-developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings. We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single-digits versus the prior year. As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services. Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year. We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their non-core outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com. PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, eye cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018. In Advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care. Our innovations include our AV detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and Apo lead genetic risk. This week, we also added P-Tau181 to our AV detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, P-Tau181 and Apo lead. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation trials in TriSalus Life Sciences. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PRISM-RA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. This year, we'll add five additional sites. Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology. Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes. Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion. While COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full-year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Stewart Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jim mentioned earlier. We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an increment impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1. And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath, the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership. To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Probably one for Sam, just on the margin outlook for '24. Can you just expand a little bit on expectations there, including maybe the cadence for the year. And then just on the margin front with PAMA, obviously, the push out, it's not a function of you getting any windfall by any means, but just that potential headwind being alleviated. Were there investments that you guys were kind of holding off on until you got more clarity on the outcome there? And then as you plan the budget, you green lit with some more of those as PAMA got pushed out. Just wondering how you thought about that expense piece there and a bit more color on margins?
Sam Samad: Yes. Thank you, Patrick. So listen, we made a lot of great progress in 2023 in terms of expanding our margins and offsetting the COVID headwind that we saw in '23. In terms of '24 expectations, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're looking to expand margins, to continue to expand margins in '24. With, again, the key drivers of that are going to be volume growth, the expectation of volume growth that we have in the plan, that's going to be the biggest impact in terms of driving margins. We're going to be looking at continuing the great work that we're doing on Invigorate and offsetting any cost headwinds. We're assuming the labor inflation to be in line with what we saw in 2023. So somewhere in that 3% to 4% growth range, not necessarily expecting it to get worse, but not necessarily expecting it to get better either. In terms of your question on PAMA, Patrick, you're absolutely right. It's not a positive. It's the absence of a negative. So essentially, the delay gives us certainty now for '24 that we're not going to see a decline. And had PAMA occurred or had PAMA come back in 2024, you're right in the sense that we would have had to potentially defer certain investments. We would have had to make some potentially difficult cuts to offset some of that impact. And the fact that we have a delay affords us the ability now to make certain investments and to avoid some of those difficult cuts that I referenced. But I think the key punchline for 2024 is that we continue to expand operating margins. Jim, you wanted to make a comment.
Jim Davis: Yes. So Patrick, you heard me discuss in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. There's still one important blood-based biomarker that we will bring up later this year. And that will complete our investments in our Alzheimer's testing from a blood-based standpoint. You heard me mention that PFAS testing. We're bringing that test up. We'll be launching that here in the first quarter. We have gotten significant consumer and physician demand to bring that test up. And then finally, we're upgrading some of our laboratory information systems in a couple of our esoteric labs. And so, the lack of this PAMA cut gives us the ability to continue to make those investments.
Operator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: I have a sort of unrelated two-part combo one. One, can you talk about sort of the progress you're making on Haystack? I know sort of you ended up sort of on the higher end of the dilution. Is that because you're sort of accelerating test pushout, didn't have seen incremental progress on that side? And then secondarily, can you remind us on your thoughts about share repo for the year? I know that's not in your current base guidance assumptions, but just wanted to hear your updated thoughts on that for capital deployment.
Jim Davis : Okay. Let me address the progress on Haystack, Sam will take the second question. So Haystack is proceeding as we expected. There's no incremental investment versus what we thought. We said last year, $0.15 to $0.20 for the half year. And then likewise, $0.15 to $0.20 incremental this year. We are bringing the assay up in our Lewisville, Texas Cancer Center of Excellence. It's proceeding as we expected. We announced -- you heard in my prepared remarks, discussions of three clinical trials. So we are doing testing right this moment. Obviously, we're not getting paid for that testing as we continue to validate the assay. But we expect to have it launched here in the first half of the year for commercial purposes.
Sam Samad: Yes. And I'll take the second question, Elizabeth. Just to be clear, the Haystack dilution in 2023 was in line with our expectations. It was $0.15 to $0.20. That's what we had called and that's where it came in, in that range of $0.15 to $0.20. With regards to share repo, so we did $275 million of share repo in Q4. Our current expectations are to basically offset equity dilution -- sorry, I said in '24, it's '23 in Q4. And our expectations are to offset equity dilution in '24. And that would work out to something in the similar range that we did in Q4. So somewhere around $250 million to $275 million. That's the base assumption, which is to offset equity dilution.
Operator: Our next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: There are a lot of moving pieces in the 2024 bridge you provided. If we look at operating margins, excluding Haystack dilution, how are operating margins in 2024 versus 2023? And then 4Q margins missed a street by a decent amount. Can you help us bridge the 4Q margins to what you're guiding to for 2024?
Sam Samad: Sure. Why don't I take that, Pito. So first of all, in terms of operating margin for 2024, what's implied in the guide at the midpoint is expansion of operating margins. We're not calling out specifically what the operating margin rate. But there's definitely growth in terms of the operating margin rate and operating margin dollars in '24 versus '23 where we came in. And that's what's implied in the guide that we gave. With regards to the moving parts around Q4 and then how you bridge that into 2024, listen, there were three things that really impacted us in Q4 from an operating margin rate perspective. We came in at 14.8%. It was still growth year-over-year, significant growth year-over-year despite a significant drop in COVID revenues. But in terms of versus expectations, yes, we missed in terms of operating margin for three key reasons. Number one was employee health care costs. So I would weigh these three reasons, by the way, equally, so one-third, one-third, one-third. But basically, employee health care cost was one-third of that miss. They came in higher than expected in Q4, and we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in '24 with regards to that. Additional -- some additional investments that we made towards the end of the year and some higher costs that we made not necessarily related to labor costs, but some investments that we made targeted investments in Q4, namely IT. So that was one-third of the miss as well. And then one-third was deferred compensation expense, which came in higher. Now remember, that's not an EPS impact. That's an operating margin impact that gets offset on the non-operating expense line. but that impacted our margins again to the tune of one-third of that miss versus our expectations. Now if you look towards '24, the employee health care costs, I mean, we've factored that into our guide. We've also taken steps to lower employee health care costs by -- I mean, we had frozen for the last three years, the employee contribution part of our employee health care cost plans. And we're having now to pass some of that on back to employees in 2024 because we had, as I said, frozen them over the last few years, even with the significant inflation that you've seen in terms of health care. So that's already assumed in 2024. As I mentioned to Patrick, what's assumed is also volume growth that's going to help us grow margins. The deferred compensation, that's just noise. We don't really budget for that. If there's a headwind or a tailwind in '24, that just gets offset on the non-operating line and it shows up as neutral in EPS. And then as I said, we made some additional investments in Q4 to position the business for 2024, and that's factored into the guide in terms of any additional investments that we make in '24. So we feel confident about our growth in terms of operating margins next -- this year.
Jim Davis: Yes. Pito, let me just go back to Q4 just to talk about the progress we made year-over-year. So as Sam indicated, our revenue in Q4 versus '22 was down $45 million. And if you look at the mix of that revenue, COVID was down $145 million year-over-year. And remember, we were getting paid $100, a record at that point. Our base business offset $100 million of that, which is why we were down $45 million. Despite that, bad mix and the lower revenue, we still improved our operating margin by 60 basis points. So we made significant progress in the quarter and that progress will continue as we march into 2024.
Operator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Jim, I was hoping to hear from you, like what are you assuming in terms of core utilization in terms of the guide? You've had elevated rates the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. Do you think that can sustain? Or are you seeing moderation in any areas?
Jim Davis: Yes. So for the fourth quarter, Jack, we saw volume growth of 5.1%. For the total year, we had volume growth of 6.5%. Now, I would tell you at the very beginning portion of this year, the first two to three weeks with the weather that we saw across the U.S., volume growth was stunted a bit. But in the last week or so, we’ve seen volume recover to the normal rates and expectations that we have for the year. So you’ve heard several of the health plans have reported higher utilization in the fourth quarter. We, ourselves, because of our own health care costs, we know there was higher utilization of our own employees. So we expect it to continue at slightly above the normal market rates, albeit the first month of the year has been tempered a little bit by weather.
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Maybe, Sam, as I think about all the comments from Jim on how it looks like the revenue outlook is good, right? You have all these tailwinds potentially going forward with new tests and whatnot. Help us bridge to getting back to that EPS or earnings growth in the long-term outlook that you've provided? Because obviously, '24 is an aberration. Are there some one-timers here? But how do you guys comfortable in that long-term earnings growth, '25 going forward?
Sam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first of all, let me say definitively that we are absolutely still confident about our long-term growth guide that we gave, which is essentially to grow revenues in the mid-single digits to grow EPS in the high single-digits. So long-term growth is unchanged. As you yourself mentioned, there are some headwinds in 2024 that I think are transient or temporary that we see this year. So we've got a COVID revenue decline, which is approximately $175 million or roughly $0.50 year-over-year. You've got -- and we've called this before, but you've got Haystack dilution, which is now full year dilution versus a half year dilution that we saw in '23. And then you've got interest expense, which is to the tune of about $0.25, which is really as a result of the additional debt that we took on and the higher borrowing costs driven by the macro environment that we’re in. But that’s really to fund acquisitions and to fund growth in the business as well in the base business. We’ve got a strong pipeline, and we feel really confident about the M&A landscape and the M&A opportunities ahead of us. And we upsized the issuance in November to basically partly pay for the acquisitions that we made in ‘23, Haystack and to some extent, NewYork-Presbyterian, but also to fund the future acquisitions, some of which are not included in this guide. So I would say the punchline is we’re definitely still confident about the long-term growth of the business and the EPS guide that we gave.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.
Andrea Alfonso: It's Andrea Alfonso in for Kevin. Unfortunately, I'm in the enviable position of asking yet another question around margin expectations. But I guess my question is, when we think about just the expansion of margins you expect and thinking about the puts and takes into next year. I guess I want to isolate like what gets better? I know that there's maybe some assumption in there around the M&A you've absorbed so far? Is that mildly accretive or just sort of in line or maybe below the margin. Some of your -- in one of your slides, I think there was some mention of GAAP charges around workforce reductions, et cetera. Is that sort of just lingering on from 2023 or is that a new tranche? Just trying to get an understanding on those two items.
Sam Samad: Yes. So thank you for the question. With regards to margin expansion, I mean as I mentioned earlier, a big factor is going to be driven by volume growth that we see in 2024. That's really the key factor. We're going to continue to invigorate actions that we have talked about to the tune of 3% cost reduction across our entire cost base. And that's -- we actually met that target in '23, we slightly exceeded it. And in '24, it's going to be continuing with those initiatives. With regards to any workforce reductions, there aren't any workforce reductions planned right now. Usually, when we have -- when you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP, we just have a placeholder for potential workforce reductions there or potential restructuring charges. But there isn't anything that's related specifically to any headcount cuts. Now we do have the cost reductions in '24 that we continue to see. So in Q1, for instance, we have some benefit from some cost reductions that we didn't see in Q1 of last year, but then we'll continue to be very disciplined about our P&L as we go forward in '24. Yes, so that's really the key driver in terms of our margin growth.
Operator: The next question will come from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ms. Gill, please check the mute button on your phone.
Lisa Gill: You talked a lot about volume growth this morning, but I'm just curious on the price side. So if I go back to the last couple of quarters, you talked about stabilizing pricing with health plans. You talked earlier about health plan leakage and the opportunity there. So maybe can you put those two pieces together for us as we think about the growth for next year of how much is volume and how much of that is on the price side?
Jim Davis: Yes. So let me just recap '23 and then we'll get into '24. So in 2023, price, pure price, price per test provided us a slight lift year-over-year, okay? So our base rev per req that we've reported was up 1.2% and price was a positive contributor towards that. Now going into 2024, we expect, again, price to be flat to slightly up for the year. We concluded all of the significant health plan renegotiations in '23. Obviously, there's a new tranche that always comes about one-third -- 25% to 33% renew every year. But we feel confident that prices will remain flat to slightly up as we enter 2024.
Operator: The next question will come from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik de Bruin: So changing track a little. Look, the LDT legislation looks like it's making more progress than it has. It's like -- can you quantify what your exposure is to LDTs and sort of your thought process here? I mean, you're introducing a bunch of new tests would qualify for that. So how do you think about incremental investments if that goes through? And would you discontinue to test there? And then as a follow-up, there's been some legal movement lately on the MRD space. There's been some litigation that's happened that has blocked some other players from the market. Does Haystack have freedom to operate as you sort of look at what's changed in the IP landscape on that? And how do you think about your IP portfolio on Haystack and being able to not get sued?
Jim Davis: Yes. So let me address your second question first. We have no risk with respect to the IP on the underlying technology that we're using in Haystack. We feel very confident about it. Much of that IP comes out of John Hopkins University, and we're solid there. So no risk. In terms of LDTs, I think we've said in the past about 10% of our tests are considered LDTs. We'll wait to hear from the FDA in April what the final rule is, and then we'll make decisions as an industry from there. What I would tell you is that we do a significant amount of work for the pharmaceutical industry today, and we do a significant amount of work for four international laboratories. Both of those require us to be ISO certified. And when you're doing work for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for companion diagnostics, you're essentially operating already under FDA regulation. So it's not going to be anything radical that we don't know what we need to do. Will there be further investments and steps required to get all of our laboratories that do LDTs accredited? Yes, there will be. But it’s not a heavy lift for Quest Diagnostics.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.
Andrew Brackmann : I want to go back to the Alzheimer's offerings and the investments that you're making there. Can you maybe just sort of talk at a high level about the opportunity that you see for that category? Should we sort of think about this market kind of ultimately looking at something like oncology where you have screening therapy selection monitoring et cetera? Or does it sort of take a different path for you guys?
Jim Davis: Yes. So thanks for the question. It's a great question. So first, I would say that there's just broader awareness of testing options that are now available to both consumers and to physicians. In part, this is because of new therapeutics that have been introduced has just created widespread awareness. As you know, the majority of testing today for Alzheimer's is conducted via PET-CT, which are expensive $2,500 to $4,000 exams or CSF testing, cerebral spinal fluid, which is not an expensive lab test. However, the procedure to extract CFS out of the human body is an expensive procedure. And likewise, the total cost of that is roughly $1,000. We have brought up blood-based assays for ApoE, which is a genetic risk for Alzheimer's. We brought up a blood-based assay for what we call AB42/40, which is generally considered the earliest indicator amyloid plaque, the earliest indicator of dementia and/or Alzheimer's onset. And then we brought up one of the two protein markers that are also involved, the Tau markers. We brought up 181 and there's a second one 217 that we will be bringing up later this year. That, in essence, completes our blood-based offering. And I think there's widespread consumer interest, widespread interest amongst primary care physicians. And we've had double-digit growth all year long in both our blood-based assays and CSF testing, and we expect that double-digit growth to continue on in 2024 and beyond.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephanie Davis of Barclays.
Stephanie Davis: So I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on to the AI question you're having and discussions around the prepared remarks. Could you tell me just a little bit more about what you'll be investing into and how maybe the rollout of things of the AI job, the AI job helper will help you guys out? And then I guess on a follow-up to that one, is it safe to assume that you'll have more IT investments as you develop some of these AI solutions that will then have more out year yield for your margin opportunity?
Jim Davis: Yes. So good question. The AI tool that we referred to with respect to our Clifton lab, is really -- it was a tool that we used to analyze the workflow within several departments in the Clifton Laboratory, that actually looked at from fairly simple things like steps and movement between equipment, loading and unloading of certain racks and we reviewed it and you find some really quick easy simplification efforts to adjust equipment, move equipment to minimize the human content or labor involved in each one of these steps. More broadly, we've deployed AI in two critical areas. One is in microbiology. Microbiology, as you know, you grow things in a dish, you look at it under a microscope. But with one of our partners, we now -- we can take digital images of what's growing in the dish and the system actually reviews those images and makes the initial call of a negative or positive. We still review the positives by high, but it's a digital image as opposed to doing it under a microscope. But it's a much quicker read because the system has generally indicated -- this system is already indicated if it is positive. We're also in the process of deploying artificial intelligence and digitizing pathology. So as you know, pathology is generally read under a microscope. We're in the process of implementing digital systems that allow for one to read off of a monitor versus under a microscope. And once you’ve digitized that slide, you’re now able to apply algorithms to, again, at least help with what we call region of interest, pointing out to the pathologist where they should look and inevitably helping the pathologists make the proper diagnosis.
Operator: And the last question for today's call will come from Eric Coldwell of Baird.
Eric Coldwell: I have actually going to have a couple here. First, the -- I missed this. What was the M&A contribution to revenue growth in 2024 guidance?
Sam Samad: So it's about 50 basis points right now is what's in the guide, Eric. And it really reflects, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the carryover that we have from the acquisitions that we did in '23, which is really NewYork-Presbyterian, The Steward Health Care, the Lenco acquisition that we signed. And really, that's it.
Eric Coldwell: So if I take mid-point revenue guidance at $1.6 million, remove the COVID headwind, you get to about 3.5% on the base and then take out 50 bps from M&A, you're at 3% organic on the base.
Sam Samad: Yes, that's correct.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. Second question, a higher mix of hospital reference testing, it sounds like. You talked about trends in hospital reference being above plan being above long-term history. What kind of an impact does that have on gross margin in the quarter?
Jim Davis: Yes. So in general, our reference testing, which is more LDT like than it is the routine testing, as you know, Eric. In general, that carries a higher test margin, higher gross margin. And in general, right, we're not drawing specimens that are derived or taken in hospitals. So there's a very little phlebotomy cost involved in reference work. So generally, the operating margin of our hospital-based tests are going to be higher than the average of the business. So that business did grow at a faster rate than our overall book of business, both in Q4 as well as for the total year. So it was good mix.
Operator: And that was our final question for today.
Jim Davis: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to further updates through the year. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.  Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We grew our base business nearly 5% in the third quarter, largely by driving growth in our physician and hospital channels. Our consumer channel also continued to produce solid base business revenue growth. In addition, we are pleased that we have now successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. These strength and collaborations will position us to build on growth opportunities going forward our Invigorate program is on track to deliver 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. In addition, the productivity of our base business improved sequentially and year-over-year. Given the strength of our business and a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth. This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the third quarter, then Sam will provide more details on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023. Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. Our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We are enabling growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions remain a key driver of our growth with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth driven by the strength in our cardiometabolic and general health and wellness testing. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. Our success is a result of the clinical and economic value we deliver to health plans and their members. Today, more than 50% of the health of the health plan revenues are generated from these value-based contracts, which are fueling double-digit growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. Together with the health plans, we have a renewed focus on initiatives to reduce leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs. In addition, we are working together to redirect volume from high-cost labs to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients and employers which are paying for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, base revenues grew high single digits in the quarter as we saw strength in hospital reference testing and continued progress with our most recent PLS relationships, including Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. Our hospital strategy is to help health systems improve productivity and patient care by delivering innovative laboratory testing that is high quality, accessible and affordable. We continue to manage a robust pipeline of professional lab services and hospital outreach acquisition opportunities. Health systems continue to face labor and cost pressures, which are prompting more of them to reach out to us for help with their lab strategy and in some cases, monetize their hospital outreach business. Our professional lab services can help manage hospitals labs, supply chain and workforce. We are also providing insights from our analytical solutions to guide hospitals to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In addition, hospital outreach acquisitions enable health systems to focus their expertise and capital on the areas of their business that support patient care and drive growth. In Consumer Health, we generated solid base business revenue growth from our consumer-initiated testing channel in the quarter. In addition, our consumer channel was again profitable this quarter. We attribute the strong performance to continuing demand for our expanded test menu, including STIs, comprehensive health and tuberculosis blood testing. Underpinning each of these key channels, physician, hospital and consumer is our advanced diagnostics. These highly innovative higher-growth test areas include molecular genomics and oncology as well as several other key areas. During the quarter, we grew revenues double digits in multiple clinical areas including neurology, women's and reproductive health, cardiometabolic and infectious disease and immunology. We are particularly encouraged by growth in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio, which features our AD-Detect blood testing services. These innovative services use highly sensitive mass spectrometry technologies to provide insight into Alzheimer's risk based on amyloid proteins and the APOE genetic risk marker. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our Alzheimer's cerebral spinal fluid panel as well, which helps providers identified levels of both amyloid and tau proteins as well as the APOE status. We also grew significantly in women's and reproductive health, especially in non-invasive prenatal and carrier screening tests. During the quarter, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our adeno-associated virus called AAV companion diagnostic, which we developed in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy. This FDA designation places us at the forefront of AAV test innovation in the growing area of cell and gene therapies and positions us to build collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies. Finally, the integration of Haystack Oncology remains on track. The acquisition positions us to enter the high-growth liquid biopsy area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. We expect to launch our first MRD test in early 2024 from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. Now turning to operational and productivity improvement. Our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our targeted 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. I'd like to share 3 examples of how we're improving operations. First, we are deploying front-end automation to enhance specimen processing in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. More sites are planned to receive front-end automation during 2024. We are expanding the use of optical character recognition, or OCR, to scan in data from samples coming into our labs. By freeing up specimen processors from this manual data entry, we will improve our productivity of paper-based recs coming into all of our regional labs by 30%. Finally, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Post pandemic, we need less space for some of our call center and administrative functions. We've reduced our real estate footprint by nearly 250,000 square feet by consolidating functions into existing spaces. Before I hand it over to Sam, I'd like to offer our perspective on the rule recently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration that would regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab developed tests are essential medical innovations that providers use to guide care for patients every day. These services are highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would impact patient care by compromising access, slowing diagnostic innovation and adding unnecessary cost to our health care system. We agree with the long-standing assertion of our trade association, ACLA, that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs under its existing medical device authority. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance.
Sam Samad : Quarter consolidated revenues were $2.3 billion, down 7.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.6% to $2.27 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 92% to $26 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 7.9% compared to the prior year reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 0.5% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.7% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 7.2% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec declined 0.4% due to growth in our PLS relationships and lower demand for respiratory panels, partially offset by an increase in unit price reimbursement and test mix. Positive unit price reimbursement was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $342 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $392 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $380 million or 16.6% of revenues compared to $423 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases and higher benefit costs, partially offset by growth in the base business, lower performance-based compensation and headcount reductions. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions and our actions to reduce support costs by approximately $100 million this year remain on track. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $2.17 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.22 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $745 million versus $1.38 billion in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and timing of collections. Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.19 billion and $9.24 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.99 billion and $9.04 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS narrowed to be in a range of $7.61 to $7.71 and adjusted EPS narrowed to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 with the midpoint of $8.70, unchanged. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered solid base business revenue growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. We successfully completed negotiations for all of our strategic health plan relationships that were scheduled for this year. We also drove improved productivity in our base business as we have done throughout 2023. Finally, given the strength of our base business, combined with a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth ahead. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.
Ann Hynes : Can you just comment on progress on what's happening with the turnover? And do you still feel good about your 16.5% margin goal for 2023?
Jim Davis: Yes, the employee turnover, again, improved from Q2 to Q3. So we're certainly seeing improvements as we've marched from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and expect to see more improvements as we go to Q4. Having said that, we're still not back to 2019 or pre-COVID levels. But we feel optimistic that as we go into next year, it will actually be a continued tailwind for us. Sam, do you want to comment on...
Sam Samad: Yes, sure. Ann, thanks for the question. So as you recall on the Q2 call, we talked about operating margin expectations being approximately 16.5%. As Jim mentioned, we're seeing slight improvements in terms of turnover. We have made some investments and are going to be making some investments in terms of frontline phlebotomist in anticipation of volumes coming into the winter season here, but also the strong utilization that we've seen. And with regards to margins, we now expect to be slightly below the approximately 16.5% for the year. We're making really good progress on all the cost initiatives and also the productivity improvement initiatives. Volumes have been strong, but we -- especially in light of volumes, we have to make some targeted investments in terms of frontline staff and phlebotomist.
Jim Davis: Yes. Ann, let me just make one other comment on the margins. If you go back and start with Q1 of this year. In Q1, we were just slightly north of 15% and in that quarter, we did $120 million of COVID revenue. And as you know, the reimbursement was still at $100 that quarter. We go to the second quarter, and we improved our margins up to 16.7%, with COVID going from $120 million down to $41 million. And then the second quarter COVID was at a blended rate of, call it, $75. Now we go back into the third quarter and COVID is really insignificant in our results. It's only 1% of our total revenue and the reimbursement on that small 1%, as you know, for the whole quarter was at $50. And we hit 16.6%, so basically in line with Q2, so we're really proud of the productivity efforts and it's really coming through in these numbers and the progress that the teams have made from Q1 to Q2 to Q3.
Operator: And our next call is David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg : So just -- thank you for the commentary on the FDA's proposal on LDTs. I'm not sure if you can answer it yet because, I mean, right now, it's still kind of maybe a little bit more hypothetical here. But how should we anticipate potential cost if it stands the way it is. I mean, is this about going back to the FDA with some of the more high-value tests? Or is this maybe about switching out to maybe IVD-cleared products. I mean how does this look for Quest and I get some of this is maybe theoretical right now because we don't know what it's going to look like in a month.
Jim Davis: Yes. I think your last statement is accurate. It's largely theoretical at this point because we don't know what it's going to look like. And the FDA certainly opened this up to commentary and response back from industry and ACLA and other associations. Look, having said all that, LDTs are not the most significant part of our operations. In fact, it's -- on a volume basis, it's less than 10% of what we do. And the 3 labs that we do are LDTs, most -- the majority of our LDTs in are actually ISO certified. We do companion diagnostics, which is a regulated form of testing, right? You're on label for a pharmaceutical drug, so it's just not -- it's not a huge deal for us right now. Now having said all that, we're going to work with our trade association. We don't believe the rule makes sense. We don't believe it's fair. And we'll continue to work to arrive at something that we do think is good for everyone. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. 
Lisa Gill: I'm just curious if you have an update as to how we should think about PAMA or SALSA going into 2024 given the current environment in DC. 
James Davis : Well, you're right, the current environment is a little uncertain at this point. But here's what I would say. The current standstill in Congress, I think we'll make what we call a comprehensive PAMA reform more difficult, right? So SALSA, I think, will be more difficult to get through this year. Having said all that, PAMA, a delay in the cuts of PAMA, again, went to the CBO. So this is a new analysis from the CBO updated versus last year. And again, the CBO scored a 1-year delay as a significant cost savings to the government. And again, the reasons for that is because if you continue to delay the PAMA cuts, you're going to continue to delay a new data collection process. And we, our trade association and obviously, the CBO is convinced that a new data collection process will lead to higher rates. So we feel good that the likelihood of a fourth PAMA delay will occur. But certainly, it has to be part of some broader health care package. And there's a lot of things that will be in that health care package that are important to a lot of different constituencies. So we're confident that something will get done there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Kieran Ryan: You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Just looking at the sequential margin progression implied from 3Q to 4Q this year. It looks like it's materially better than kind of what you averaged in that pre-COVID 2017 -- 2019 range. So is that just really the tailwinds you have around CIT Invigorate better turnover and lower deferred comp just combining to drive better trends than normal. And I was just wondering, is there any offset there on some of these oil and commodity-related costs that we've seen step-up relatively recently? 
Sam Samad: Yeah, Kiran, this is Sam. Thanks for the question. So I think some of the drivers that you would expect in Q4 are, you know, what we've been executing and seeing in Q3 and earlier in the year. I mean, Jim talked about the sequential improvement in operating margins despite the fact that COVID is coming down significantly. So what we would expect in Q4 is the following that helps our margins, which has been playing out so far over the course of the year. One is price. We continue to see a healthy positive environment around price and we, in fact, saw positive price in Q3, and we expect to see positive price in Q4. And that's driven by all the work that we're doing around the strategic plan, the third-party plan renewals and some of the value-based contracting that we're doing there. So definitely, the healthiest pricing environment that we've seen in a while. CIT, as you said, is a factor. It was dilutive in the first quarter. It turned profitable in the second quarter. It was profitable in the third, and we expect it to be profitable again in the fourth. We continue to do the cost -- I mean, we see the benefit of the cost reductions in Q4. We talked about $100 million of annual impact of cost reductions on the SG&A line, and we expect to see that at least 1/3 of that be in Q4 as well because those savings started in Q2 and then we're taking a lot of actions as well around improving productivity. Invigorate is one of them that you mentioned, but that's also factoring into margin. So all of that is driving the better than pre-pandemic trends that you've talked about. Now as I said earlier, we are still seeing turnover in -- higher than what we would expect. It has improved slightly in Q3, but it is still trending higher than where it was pre-pandemic. And as I said, given the strong utilization that we're seeing across the business, and we saw that in Q3 as well, we're having to make some targeted increases across frontline staff and phlebotomists to help service some of these volumes. And we expect that to be an impact in Q4 and offsetting more of a headwind of an impact.
Operator: Our next caller is Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.
Elizabeth Anderson : I guess I just want to double click on the gross margin a little bit more in the third quarter. I think in different answers, you've given us bits and pieces. But if you could just talk either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis, sort of rank or either if you have dollar amounts or sort of rank order the biggest contributing factors? And then secondly, it sounds like you have some good sightline into the Invigorate savings in fourth quarter and some continued productivity initiatives. How do we think about the flow-through on sort of that -- as we start to think about 2024 and sort of what we might be expecting from those sort cost saving in Invigorate programs?
Sam Samad: Yes. Thank you. So with regards to gross margin, gross margins in Q3 were in line with our expectations. I mean, the key driver, I would say, for them being below Q2 levels, were the fact that we had lower revenues of $45 million going in Q3 versus Q2. So sequentially, we saw a $45 million lower revenues. Now a portion of that was COVID, not the biggest portion. It was about roughly $15 million lower revenues in terms of COVID. And then because of seasonality, as expected, we saw lower revenues on the base [Technical Difficulty] as well. So when you think about the impact on gross margins and gross margins were down a percentage point sequentially, that's almost entirely driven by revenue, the revenue decline. And then on COVID, we're also talking about -- or what we are seeing in Q3 was a lower price around COVID. In Q2, driven by the fact that the PHE didn't end until midway through the quarter, we saw a higher price on average for COVID, we saw a lower price in Q3. So that has an impact on gross margin as well. So those are the key drivers on gross margin. It's in line with our expectations. Invigorate, and Jim will make a couple of comments on Invigorate here. But with regards to Invigorate the actions are yielding the 3% productivity improvements and cost reductions that we expected. And those will continue into 2024. But Jim, maybe make a couple of comments.
Jim Davis: Yes, certainly, Elizabeth. So we're going to set targets going into 2024 that are similar to what we've done in the past. So we expect to generate approximately 3% variable cost productivity throughout our entire operations. That's phlebotomy, logistics, the front end of our lab and then actually all of the processing. We've talked broadly about the use of automation. We're Driving that as fast and furious as we can. We've talked about the use of artificial intelligence to do some of the manual work that our lab text, this could be automated reading of curves. We've talked about in the past, the use of artificial intelligence and microbiology, hematology, urinalysis, and then we continue to work the standard things that we always work as a business, reimbursement and denials is always a big bucket of opportunity for us. Paper [reqs], I talked in the prepared remarks about implementing OCR technology to read all of these paper [reqs] that still come in. We work them down every single year, but there's still a fair number. Even if it's 15% to 20%, when you do the math on that, close to 200 million rec, there's still a ton of opportunity there. So we feel good about our productivity efforts going into next year. We invest in it. We put talented teams around it, and we'll continue to drive it hard.
Operator: Next caller is Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin : I've got two. The first one, just going back to PAMA. In 2023, it got delayed, and I think it will probably get delayed in '24. But in '23, we didn't see a lot of the savings dropped down to the bottom line because of Haystack and some of the other investments that you're doing. I guess, for '24, does that drop down, if we're to get delayed, i.e., is it accretive to what your plans would be is that you're going to do it? Or does it get offset by that? So that's the first one. And then I've got a follow-up.
Jim Davis: Yes. Well, first, I'd say with respect to the drop down, when we look at the drop-down on the incremental growth we've gotten through our base business and we look at the drop-down on that growth, we're pretty happy with it, okay? And that is after the dilution effect that we've seen from Haystack, the investments we're making there, which are going to propel future growth. As we go into next year, we will take -- we're not going to give guidance today, but we're going to take a close look if PAMA does get delayed, we'll obviously look at both investment opportunities to drive future growth. We'll look at investment opportunities to drive margin improvement, Invigorate investments. And then we'll also obviously look at returning like we always do, the majority of our free cash to shareholders.
Derik De Bruin : And just a follow-up on the Alzheimer's diagnostics, are you going to seek FDA approval for that? I'm just sort of curious on reimbursement, patient cost, what's the test cost in doing it? I'm just curious on sort of what your strategy is there given that it is a new diagnostic category.
Jim Davis: Okay. So there is reimbursement for the test today. CMS has established about $100 reimbursement for the blood-based AD 4240 test. Having said all that, the preponderance of our orders and the preponderance of our reimbursement actually comes from client build, where we directly bill health systems that are carrying for these patients. And I would tell you that the reimbursement is better than what we see on average from Medicare because it's an incredibly value-added test. So we price it appropriately. At this point, we're not seeking FDA approval for it, it's an LDT like many of the LDTs that we run. And so, we're pretty happy with it. The growth has been substantial and I would also tell you that the growth of our CSF testing, the cerebral spinal fluid testing is also significantly up in the quarter as clinicians are using both CSF and blood-based biomarkers to make to help with the diagnosis of patients.
Sam Samad: And Derek, maybe just to come back to the PAMA question and add a couple of points there for you and others that are on the call. Given the uncertainty around PAMA, we will plan today as if PAMA is going to come back and will not be delayed in 2024. I'd say that's the prudent thing to do. That's the only thing we can do at this stage given the uncertainty. So we will plan as if prices will come down next year because PAMA will come back. Now if -- as we -- I would say, on balance, I'd say there's a likely chance that PAMA will get delayed. And if that were to happen, and as we've talked about before, we could see an $80 million to $90 million benefit as a result of that delay, not benefit versus this year, but benefit versus our planning. And when that -- and if that happens, I should say, then we will assess how much we invest in the business to everything that Jim said earlier to how much potentially could drop to the bottom line to EPS. But that decision is not made yet. We'll make that decision when we set guidance. And will evaluate investments that we can make and then evaluate what we can drive as EPS improvement.
Operator: Our next caller is Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.
Andrew Brackmann : Jim, I want to go back to your comments around reducing leakage to high cost labs. I think you talked about in your opening remarks. I know that's sort of part of the strategy here, but can you maybe just sort of talk about that opportunity broadly and just sort of quantify how big that could be for your growth going forward?
Jim Davis: Yes. I think there's 2 buckets of opportunity there. One is reducing leakage to out-of-network labs. And then the second is what I would call steerage of work from high-priced in-network labs generally in health systems to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So generally 2 different initiatives, but it really starts with just very strong and tight collaboration with our commercial payers. We work hand-in-hand with them. They provide us the information on what physicians are using out-of-network high-priced laboratories, and they provide us the information that what doctors are sending work into health system labs, which, as you know, not good for patients who are going to pay higher deductibles, higher co-pays and obviously not good for the people that are paying for the health care in general, that's still employers in the country. So it's a really tight partnership. We get the information. We distribute that information out to our commercial team. We call on the customers, try to convince them to move the work. At the same time, we're always messaging as are the commercial payers out to patients to remind them that they can save money by using independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. We continue to message physicians and providers, and that's why we're seeing significantly higher growth rates with the commercial plans where we have established these types of relationships.
Operator: Our next caller is Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo : Congrats on the contract renewals with your major payer partners. Can you maybe talk a little bit about if there's anything new in the contracts, the duration of the contracts? Is there -- the last time you did this, there were incentives that actually benefited you in terms of driving volumes. Just wondering if anything has changed, both positively or negatively, pricing, duration, terms, incentives, that kind of thing?
Jim Davis: Yes. We generally don't talk about the terms, duration and things like that. But what I will tell you is that the trend continues. We seek to establish a fair price first and foremost. And then second, as I just mentioned in the previous question, where we can move these requisitions and improve our share of the commercial payer spend. We try to design incentives around that. In addition, we try to design incentives, when we do a hospital outreach acquisition and the prices go from 300% of Medicare as an example down to our rates, we try to step those rates down over a period of time so that we derive benefit and the commercial plan derives benefit. So we work hard to build those types of incentives into the agreement and I think the trend just continues in the direction we want.
Kevin Caliendo : Does this lead to sort of more value-based care potential for you guys going forward?
Jim Davis: Well, I separate again, value-based care from value-based contracts. These are what we call value-based contracts, meaning when we deliver value back to the commercial payer, there can be incentive payments involved in that. When we talk about value-based care, these are really our arrangements with some of these ACO reach organizations and some of the other large physician groups that have taken on risk from Medicare Advantage plans. And we continue to embed ourselves when these within these ACO reach programs and continue to work closely with large physician groups that take on this risk. And as we said in the past as we said in the past, when these types of relationships are really good for the lab industry, they -- if you're managing risk, you're managing the cost of health care to a fixed number every year, you're generally going to be incented to provide early care and early diagnostics so that you don't let disease progress into more expensive inpatient care and we continue to work towards that.
Operator: Our next caller is Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan : I have a couple of cleanup questions for Sam. First is on collections. So seeing a little AR build? I know you called it out, but anything -- any color you can add on that? And then second is on the base growth, 5% pretty good. I was just wondering if weather weekdays had any impact could have actually been better on an underlying basis?
Sam Samad: Yes. Sure. I'll take the first one, Jack, and Jim will talk a little bit about the -- any one-timer, so to speak, whether days. Listen, collections nothing of note there. I think AR trending or DSO is trending a bit up. That's really more normal trends given the reduction in COVID. With COVID, I think that would help our DSOs overall a shorter collection window and DSOs were down as a result of a higher mix of COVID. But if you look back to pre-pandemic, I think the DSOs are kind of trending back to where they were pre-pandemic. So really nothing of note there. There's some timing at the end of Q3 as well, but that's just normal timing within quarters. So I would say, in general, collections are on track, and we're happy with where things are. But Jim, did you want to make a couple of comments around base earning growth and any one-timers?
Jim Davis: Yes, weather and days and things like that, versus last year, weather was a slight help I mean, not significant at all, Jack, but it was a slight help because last year's hurricane in September was worse than this year's hurricane. The only other comment on days that I would make is early in the quarter in July. The fourth of July fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Monday last year. So in essence, your Monday and Tuesday are really, really bad days versus a year ago. You only had one bad day called a Monday because the fourth fell on a Monday. But again, that's one day out of 90. So yes, I mean, a little bit of an impact there, but not that significant.
Operator: Our next caller is Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly : Maybe a couple of follow-ups on Haystack. It sounds like still a 24 time line there. Can you just talk about I guess, any more specific timing and the catalyst set there when we could expect to see some data? And then just also the spend expectations related to getting that through the approval process as we work our way through ‘24 would be helpful.
Jim Davis: Yes, as we've said, Haystack continues on the timeline that we set for ourselves, for the team. There's been evidence generation, obviously that's what we made our -- was part of our decision-making process. Now as we get the assay, what I call ready for commercial release, commercial production, we're in the process of establishing relationships with some of our key oncology partners. So when the assay is ready, we'll start to do some of the testing likely we'll use a lot of that early testing to then seek reimbursement once we get a substantial buildup of testing that we feel good about approaching the Maxon and so far, so good. We're bringing up the assay, as we mentioned, in our Lewisville, Texas Oncology Center of Excellence and feel good about that. I'll let Sam touch on the financials with respect to...
Sam Samad: Yes, sure. I mean with regards to spend, I'll talk in dilution terms and EPS terms here this year, and then I'll talk -- address your question around '24, Patrick. So again, very pleased with the progress that the team is making. This year, we're expecting EPS dilution to be in the $0.15 to $0.20 range. We talked about that on the Q2 call. It's still in the same range, $0.15 to $0.20. If you look towards '24, what we've said and this still applies, is that the annualized dilution in 2024 is going to be less than what we expect to see -- what you see this year. So the $0.15 to $0.20, if you annualize that, that's $0.30 to $0.40 next year. So we expect on an annual basis next year to be less than where things are trending this year. So improvement just on an annual basis. And then as we look forward, we expect 25% dilution to be lower than 24%, and then we expect 26% to actually be accretive. So that's consistent with what we said when we announced the deal consistent with what we said on the Q2 call.
Operator: Our next caller is Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright : You laid out some of those key profit drivers for the fourth quarter. And as we think about what kind of continues into 2024, I think you mentioned in the previous question kind of -- or a previous question, productivity gains should continue, and I understand there's PAMA dynamics as well that are somewhat unknown. But should we anticipate a deviation from the long-term profit guidance is like 50 to 100 basis points operating margin expansion next year?
Sam Samad: Well, let me clarify, Erin, and thanks for the question, by the way. So what we talked about at Investor Day is an improvement of 75 to 150 basis points over the 3 years and that's off of the rate that we have for 2023. So we had said at the time the rate was approximately 17%. We said we could improve over the next 3 years by 75 to 150 basis points in terms of operating margin with the lower end being PAMA did come back in '24 and the higher end of 150 being either if we had comprehensive reform around SALSA or PAMA gets delayed. So the 75 to 150 over the 3 years still applies. That has not changed. Now it's going to apply off of a lower base in 2023 because our operating margin expectations have come down. As I said earlier on the call, we expect it to be slightly below -- marginally below the approximately 16.5% that we talked about on the Q2 call. The positive drivers and by the way, that operating margin expansion was for 3 -- over the 3 years, not for 2024. But the positive drivers in 2024 still apply. I mean, first of all, first and foremost, I would say, is the pricing environment. We are very encouraged by the pricing environment. We talked about the strategic relationships that have been renewed, and we're seeing positive price ex PAMA, depending on what happens next year, but we're seeing positive price, and we expect that to continue. We're seeing the growth investments starting to yield fruit and CIT being one of them. And we talked about that becoming profitable. Productivity improvement, both in terms of Invigorate and also hires that we do, for instance, phlebotomist that we're adding we expect that productivity or their productivity to improve next year as well as they gain more experience and they're more productive. So all of those drivers we expect to continue. Turnover is a bit of an uncertain item. We don't necessarily expect it to become worse than it is today. But it's too early to say right now whether that improves markedly in 2024. The early signs that we saw in Q3. Right now, we're encouraging. We saw some slight improvement, but it's too early to say to project what that would mean for 2024.
Jim Davis: Yes. Erin. The last thing I'd say is we're encouraged by the volume trends. And as you know, incremental volume coming into the business in a business that has lots of fixed costs certainly mixes up the existing margin rate. So we feel good about the volume trends in our physician office. We feel good about the volume trends in health systems. And as I mentioned in the script, we feel good about our funnel of M&A opportunities that are in front of us as we march through the fourth quarter and early next year.
Operator: Our last caller is Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut : I guess, Sam, just to follow up on Erin's question really quickly. If we think about the composition of margin between gross profit and G&A, is this the right baseline to build off of factoring all the things that you mentioned, such productivity gains and maybe PAMA. And then maybe just, Jim, a quick follow-up. Hospital deals. Obviously, you've had some growth there. How should we be thinking about the pipeline and your ability to sustain the growth rate given what's in the pipeline today?
Sam Samad: Yes. I mean with regards to the first question, Brian, we believe it is the right baseline to build off of. 2024 is not the period to look at in terms of that improvement that we talked about, the 75 to 150. There are a couple of factors in there. One of them, there's the uncertainty of PAMA, obviously. But the other one is COVID, which is approximately $200 million this year, is going to be a factor next year in terms of the drop off. It's going to be a negative factor. Again, albeit a much smaller one than what we saw from '22 into '23, but it's still going to be a factor in terms of the approximately $200 million going to something we believe much less than that as it becomes just another regular test like a flu test, for instance, but the baseline, we believe, is the right one, and we are still confident about the 75 to 150 basis point improvement on operating margin over the 3 years.
Jim Davis: Yes. Brian, as I said in the script, we're encouraged by the breadth and depth of our funnel of opportunities in hospital outreach as well as PLS. And I say that our teams are working them very hard. And the trends are pointing in our direction, right, with the cost of capital going up for health systems, their investments, I think, are truly focusing on the things that will drive growth for health systems, whether that's investments in neurology, cardiology, cancer, obstetric, those are the things that drive growth in health systems. And so when you make all those investments, albeit now at capital costs that are significantly higher, they can turn to us to make the investments they need in laboratories. When you see institutions like New York Presby sell their outreach book of business and really focus their investments on the things that are driving their growth. I think that's a good sign of how health care systems, they're really good strategic ones are really thinking today.
Operator: That was our last question for the day.
Jim Davis : All right. Everyone, thanks again for joining our call today. We certainly appreciate all your continued support. I also want to thank the Quest Diagnostics team who, as we've transitioned away from COVID, have really done a magnificent job in continuing to drive growth in our base business, drive productivity and continue to satisfy our patients, providers and all those that use Quest Diagnostics. So thanks, everyone, and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.  Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.  Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.
James Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Demand for our services remains strong across all regions boosted by the collaborations we have formed with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid an environment where people are returning to care.  We are particularly encouraged by the revenue growth in our base business of nearly 10% from our health system customers. Also in the second quarter, we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year despite persistently high employee turnover.  Total adjusted operating margin improved more than 170 basis points compared to the first quarter despite a decline of approximately $80 million in COVID revenue.  This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the second quarter, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023.  Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. As we shared at Investor Day, our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers as they navigate the changing landscape in health care. We will enable this growth with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology.  In addition, acquisitions will continue to be key drivers of our growth. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service.  So let's review progress we've made in each one of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered strong base volume growth from physicians, largely through our partnerships with health plans, which have expanded our access to the market. A growing number of these involve value-based arrangements and are generating faster growth and share gains than the traditional relationships. These arrangements position us as a more strategic partner with health plans as we work together on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs.  In addition, NewYork-Presbyterian's recently acquired outreach assets brought us new volume from the physicians.  In Hospital Lab Services, base revenue from health systems grew nearly 10% in the quarter. The Professional Lab Services business had a very strong quarter as we saw solid growth from both new and existing PLS relationships.  We are particularly encouraged by progress with our new PLS partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. As hospitals continue to experience financial challenges, we are here to help whether through professional lab services, reference testing or purchasing the hospital's outreach assets. We are now seeing growing momentum with a significant pipeline of potential deals with large health systems.  In Consumer Health, we had strong base business growth on questhealth.com. We continue to optimize our marketing efforts to target our customers more strategically and now expect consumer-initiated testing to be profitable through the balance of 2023.  Also during the quarter, we launched Genetic Insights, our first consumer-initiated genetics health test on questhealth.com. This saliva-based test leverages our expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 3 dozen genes for inherited risk of conditions ranging from breast and colon cancer through carrier status for cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs. We are encouraged by initial demand for this new offering, which adds to our growing test options for health-minded consumers.  As discussed at Investor Day in March, a key pillar of our strategy is to support faster growth across all customer segments through highly specialized advanced diagnostics. These offerings include molecular genomics and oncology tests such as germline testing to assess prenatal and hereditary genetic risk and somatic testing for tumor sequencing.  Advanced Diagnostics also encompasses other key areas, including neurology, women's reproductive health and cardiometabolic health. In neurology, we continue to achieve strong growth from our innovative Quest AD-Detect, portfolio of Alzheimer's blood tests, which help identify early indications of beta amyloid and ApoE status. AD-Detect strongly positions Quest to lead in this rapidly evolving Alzheimer's landscape. Emerging therapies for Alzheimer's represent a new era in treatment and testing for this disease. Like many diseases, early intervention in Alzheimer's may promote better outcomes.  Our AD-Detect portfolio enables accessible and convenient evaluation of Alzheimer's risk potentially at early stages and the monitoring of progression. AD-Detect is now available to our physician customers in the U.S., and we believe it also has the potential to generate strong consumer demand.  In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services. In June, we completed our acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which positions us to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive technique for early detection of residual or recurring cancer with the potential to improve outcomes for patients being treated for cancer.  The integration of Haystack is on track, and we continue to expect to introduce our first MRD test in early 2024. We intend to launch this test from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where we also recently introduced our solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring.  I'd like to say a little more about our M&A strategy. Haystack is a capabilities acquisition. And as we've said, it will initially be dilutive for earnings per share. However, our primary focus in M&A continues to be on traditional hospital outreach purchases and tuck-in lab deals that are accretive to earnings in the first year.  To underscore what I said earlier, our M&A pipeline is robust as hospital systems faced continued margin pressures due to labor challenges and a shift from inpatient to outpatient care.  Turning to operational and productivity improvement, our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our 3% annual productivity savings target. As we discussed at Investor Day, Invigorate includes deploying automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. In the quarter, we implemented our automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, Kansas. Next up is Lewisville, Texas. When complete, 4 of our major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with embedded artificial intelligence identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity.  We are also excited by results of a pilot in our Clifton lab that showed AI speed data collection in specimen processing and expect to implement this AI solution across all of our major regional labs later this year. In genomics, we're utilizing AI in bioinformatics to improve and speed variant classification and prioritization. These are just a couple of the many examples of our use of AI and automation to continuously improve our operations.  In addition, we believe generative AI has great potential to deliver insights and content not only to better target and serve customers, but also to create innovations that help standardize our lab operations. We are encouraged by preliminary results of pilots that use generative AI and our customer service center to automate call their sentiment analysis and quality control and in our marketing operations to improve market research and customer targeting.  Now before I turn it over to Sam, I'll close by saying that we always knew 2023 would be a challenging year as we transitioned away from COVID-19 testing and supported the nation's return to care. Our dedicated employees on the front lines and everyone else who supports them, have done a magnificent job of bringing our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. I'm really proud to be leading this Quest Diagnostics' team.  And now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.34 billion, down 4.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 9.5% to $2.3 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 88% to $41 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 4.9% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business.  Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew 0.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 7.4% versus the prior year as we continue to see a broad-based return to care throughout the quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.5% due to more tests per req, changes in test mix and benefits recognized with certain value-based arrangements.  Unit price reimbursement was flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $348 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $388 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $389 million or 16.7% of revenues compared to $435 million or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Compared to the first quarter, we made strong progress improving the profitability of the business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially while total revenues were essentially flat versus Q1.  We also absorbed higher SG&A costs related to an increase in the market value of the obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan in the second quarter, which lowered adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. This has no impact on EPS. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. Since last fall, we have taken a series of actions to reduce support costs, which will save more than $100 million this year.  Those savings largely began in Q2, and we're on track with our estimates in the quarter. Frontline employee turnover improved marginally earlier this year, but the pace of improvement has not met our expectations, and it remains well above historical levels. We continue to feel the effects of the tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages.  Turnover continues to be a drag on productivity despite the strong base business growth. Reported EPS was $2.05 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $538 million versus $882 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income.  Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.12 billion and $9.22 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.92 billion and $9.02 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $7.92 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We've raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect our strong performance through the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Note that the year-over-year comparison for the base business becomes more difficult in the second half of 2023 as we begin to lap some PLS wins later in the year. Also, we are not expecting demand for respiratory panels to be as strong as we saw in last year's flu season, which could be a headwind to revenue of nearly 100 basis points in the back half.  We expect revenue and adjusted EPS to be more even in the third and fourth quarters, which is a slight departure from our typical earnings seasonality due to the following factors: Unit price reimbursement is expected to improve in the back half. Our CIT business turned profitable in Q2 and is expected to be more accretive to both revenue and earnings as we move throughout the second half of 2023. And cost actions taken throughout the first half of the year will continue to improve the overall profitability of the business.  Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to experience higher frontline turnover and a tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Higher SG&A costs related to our supplemental deferred comp plan also lowered the operating margin by 30 basis points in the first half of 2023, but had no impact on EPS. As a result, our updated guidance reflects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 16.5% for the full year.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
James Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth as our collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians enabled us to benefit from strong demand amid a broad return to care.  We made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year. This was slightly offset by persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases cost. And finally, our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: I wanted to start and ask about kind of the health plan commentary. Is it possible to tease out how much of this growth could be share gain related versus just strong underlying demand and somewhat related, we have heard more discussion about national payers being more active around payment integrity. I was just curious if you're seeing that at all, could that be a positive or negative for Quest?
James Davis: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So it's always hard to discern in this industry what is share gain versus demand return to care and things like that. We don't get perfect data on it. But our sense is it's some of both. On the share gain side, we look closely at our growth through each of the commercial payers. And when we see gains that are above and beyond the average and we see the benefits of those programs, those value-based programs that we work with them, which is around leakage. It's around focusing on physicians that are using out-of-network labs, we see the benefits of those programs, and therefore, conclude its share gain. Certainly, there's been some strong return to care.  On the Payment Integrity side, I can tell you that, look, it's a never-ending effort here in Quest Diagnostics to continuously work denials, to make sure that we understand the payer policies, what are the diagnostic that support those policies and then work back through our physician base to make sure that the tests that they're ordering are appropriate tests. So we haven't seen any discernible impact with some of those policies you're referring to. But we work collaboratively with the payers to understand them and then work back with our physician base to try to correct any errors.
Jack Meehan: Super. Sam, one question on margins. Sorry if I missed this. What is the guide now assume for margins for the year? And can you just talk about what you're assuming in terms of the pace of productivity improvement?
Sam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So we are assuming for the year, operating margins to be at approximately 16.5%. In terms of productivity, you've seen good benefits from our Invigorate program. And we expect those to, if anything, continue for the rest of the year and even accelerate in Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing good momentum on our Invigorate programs. We're seeing the $100 million of SG&A savings that we've talked about. We're seeing those materialize as of the beginning of Q2, and they will continue for the rest of the year as well for a total year impact of $100 million.  On the other side, we are also seeing, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a tough labor and turnover and macro environment. So turnover continues to persist to be higher than we expected, and that's driving pressure also on margins. But we are expecting approximately 16.5% for the year in terms of OM.
James Davis: Yes. Jack, I would just add, obviously, you can see the base -- you can see the margin improvement from Q1 to Q2. That comes through pretty clear. You can do the math on the base margin improvements from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year, when you make the assumptions on the drop-down of the COVID revenue, which you've -- you're in the range with the numbers you've used in the past. So we're really pleased with the base margin improvement from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year and very pleased with the improvement from Q1 of this year to Q2 of this year.
Operator: Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Congrats on a good quarter. My question is, I realized there was a ton of noise this quarter on the deferred comp and how that nets out. How -- could one -- what is your assumption in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the back half of the year? I appreciate that it can be different based on what happens to the future stock price. But I just want to understand whether it's sort of continuing the forecast of last year's trajectory into this year or 2Q going forward or what have you?  And then secondarily, how do you think about you mentioned the labor productivity and sort of the still elevated turnover. So how do you think about sort of the cost benefit of analysis of perhaps like investing more in wages or something like that versus the productivity gains that you would -- you could potentially receive from that?
Sam Samad: Okay. Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate the congrats. So let me talk about DCP deferred compensation, and I'll turn to Jim for productivity and some of the trade-offs that you're referring to there. So in terms of DCP, let me just clarify what it is and the impact.  So first of all, the expense that we saw, which impacts SG&A is the -- related to the increase in the market value of obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan. That does not have an impact on EPS because it is offset on the nonoperating income line with a benefit. So it's a net neutral on EPS, but it does impact operating margin. Sometimes we don't see it materially impact us. It's related to market movements.  This quarter, it impacted us materially to the tune of 30 basis points impact on operating margin percent. So if you exclude that, it would be our operating margin percent would have been 17%. If you compare it to last year, because last year, and this is where it gets maybe a bit more complicated. But last year, we actually had a benefit in terms of expenses on -- related to deferred compensation, plan market value -- the fair market value change. And so compared to last year Q2, it's an impact of 1%.  So actually, if you compare Q2 2023 OM versus Q2 2022 OM, we would have been relatively flat in terms of operating margin percent quarter-over-quarter last year even despite the drop in COVID revenues, a significant drop to the tune of approximately $300 million that we saw year-over-year in terms of COVID revenues.  Now as you look towards the rest of the year, Liz, we don't forecast deferred compensation plan. I mean that's not something that we forecast. We assume it's a net neutral impact, both on the P&L, on EPS and on operating margin. So the impact that we saw in the first half, which is roughly about 50 basis points of operating margin or 30 basis points, I should say, is carried through for the rest of the year. And so that 16.5% full year operating margin is impacted by the DCP in the first half. So that's the best way I can characterize it.
James Davis: Yes. And Liz, on the labor front, at Investor Day, we showed a chart that said pre-COVID, our turnover of what we call our frontline roles, which is phlebotomy, logistics, specimen processing, our call centers, was in the 14% range, our total turnover. We showed a chart that said in the fourth quarter, it was upwards of 23%. It's come down modestly in the first part of the year, but still hasn't come down to the levels, obviously, pre-COVID or to where we would like them. Now you're right. It's a trade-off between increasing wage rates and the price -- and the cost you pay for this turnover. We've estimated that each turnover, each person can cost us upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 depending on the role. And that's simply the lost productivity or the time it takes to get somebody from day 1 to as efficient in that role as a person who's been in the role for 2-plus years.  So it's about $8,000 to $10,000 which if you do the math on that, could have upwards of a $20 million impact in the second half of this year. Now we're at the high end of our wage rate guidance that we gave. We said 3% to 4%. We're certainly at that high end. And if we need to make adjustments, we obviously look at the ROI on that. And we're faced with those decisions. And in certain markets, we will make adjustments to get the turnover to a place that we're comfortable with.
Operator: Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Maybe just to pivot over and ask you about your Health System Business. I think last quarter, you said in aggregate, it was growing about 70%. And this quarter, the press release says it's just under 10%. And I suspect with NewYork-Presbyterian and so forth coming online fully in the back half, it might be even higher than 10%. When you think about your margin targets and what you're shooting for, can you comment on how the growth in that side of the business is impacting margins and the opportunity? And if there's any updated thoughts on the pipeline that you're seeing, maybe give us that as well.
James Davis: Yes. Thanks, A.J. Just on the NewYork-Presbyterian book of business, when we buy that outreach book of business, it actually is in our Physician bucket, not our Health System bucket, because it's physician offices, and we build third-party payers for that.  Our Health System business in the quarter was really helped by the PLS side. Our reference book of business was strong as well, but our PLS growth was very, very strong. excited by the 3 deals that we mentioned in the script with Tower Health, Lee Health and Northern Lights being some of the newer ones. So it was -- that generated substantially more growth in the quarter.  Now as we've always said, PLS has slightly lower operating margins than our normal physician office book of business. But we really like the ROIC on that, okay? So it's got a strong return on capital and that's why we continue to do this. So in terms of the outlook, our funnel of opportunities is strong. We hope to have more closed in the second half of this year on both the PLS side as well as new reference wins. So we're optimistic that the Health Systems portion of our business will continue to grow.
Sam Samad: Yes. And one additional comment, A.J. So with regards to the expectations in the second half on PLS, as Jim said, we are seeing strong growth in that business. In the second half, from a year-over-year perspective, we had some big wins in the first half of last year as well that ramped up in the second half of last year. So from a year-over-year perspective, we do lap some of those PLS wins and that mutes our revenue growth to some extent. But we're seeing really great momentum on the PLS side of the business.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Sam, again, that 16.5%, is that now the right number to work off in terms of the long-term guide? And you talked about a few of the moving parts, the unit pricing, maybe looking a little better, labor hitting it. Any of these things onetime that would wear off? And then on that pricing, I know you guys negotiate kind of 1/4 of the contracts annually. Can you just talk about the pricing environment at the moment?
Sam Samad: Yes. No, it's -- so the 16.5% would be the launching point if you're thinking about the 3-year outlook, Patrick, and the improvement that we guided in the -- in Investor Day, which is the 75 to 150 basis point improvement. That's still the right number to be thinking about longer term off of the 16.5% launching point at the end of this year.  In terms of a couple of things that you mentioned, onetime items I think we talked about the DCP, which was more significant in Q2 and for the first half of the year, maybe you can call that onetime. But although it is recurring, but we don't forecast for it. Sometimes it's a benefit. Sometimes it's a negative in terms of an operating margin percent. Last year, in the first half, it was actually a benefit. This year in the first half, it's a negative.  Pricing environment is very good. It's really good. We're seeing good momentum with the health plan value-based contract arrangements that we have. And we expect the pricing environment actually in the second half, where the pricing benefit in the second half to improve versus the first half.  Now as we think about '24, we've talked about before that PAMA is still an uncertainty. And so until we have more certainty around whether there's another PAMA delay or a SALSA bill that gets passed, there's still some uncertainty there for '24.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Congrats on the quarter. Sam, maybe I'll follow up just on Patrick's question, right? So as I think about your previous comments on 2024 guidance or targets for operating margin, does this push out what you had previously kind of guided to for 2024? And maybe kind of related to that, as I think about the $100 million of corporate savings that you've outlined that began in Q2. I mean is there more to squeeze or is it sort of the target run rate and we're just going to see it flow through the P&L into next year as well?
Sam Samad: Yes. So with regards to -- thank you, Brian, first of all, for the question. So with regards to 24, we didn't guide 24. We gave some long-term targets around what we expect our operating margin to look like over the next 3 years as we continue to execute on productivity improvements, Invigorate and apply cost savings into the business. The $100 million that you referred to, which, by the way, next year will be part of our run rate. So we wouldn't expect to see an improvement year-over-year in '24 versus '23 because we're -- except for maybe 1 quarter.  But I would say the 16.5%, as I mentioned to Patrick, becomes the launching point for the future. And we do expect with continued Invigorate offsetting inflation with the cost reductions in the business that we've applied and now will continue and that are generating the expected improvements, we do expect to drive improvement in our operating margins long term. There is the uncertainty about PAMA, which is what drives the range of either 75 to 150 basis points improvement over the 3 years.
James Davis: Yes. Then in terms of the cost take out $100 million. Look, we're always looking to be the most efficient we can and obviously, spend every dollar as wisely as we can. But we're also going to continue to invest in this business. We've made strong investments in CIT. And I think as you heard in our script, it's paying off for us. We've got really nice growth out of that. It's now turned profitable.  The Alzheimer's test that we've brought to market that requires investment, and we're going to continue to invest in that space. We're going to continue to invest in molecular genomics and oncology because we're getting growth in that space. And with the Haystack acquisition, we're going to continue to invest there to try to get the test to market as quickly as possible and build a stronger presence. So we're always going to balance the 2. But we're investing in this business for the future.
Operator: The next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Chickering: There's been a big debate among both the corporates and investors on the sustainability of the current trends of utilization. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing in July and sorry if I missed this, but how much of the 2Q organic growth was sort of organic versus the PLS transactions? And how should we think about organic growth continuing in the back half of the year?
James Davis: Yes. So we're optimistic that the growth will continue here. In the second half of the year, July to date has been strong consistent with what we saw in June. We generally don't break apart our PLS growth from the growth in our core business. We've said externally that our PLS growth is -- our PLS business is about a $600 million franchise. We said the health system market grew at 10%, PLS grew north of that, reference grew less than that.  So I think you can get a sense for what that contributes to our total growth. But we're optimistic on the prospects with our health systems. The funnel of PLS opportunities remain strong. Health systems need our help, and we think we've got a great offering that helps meet their needs.
Sam Samad: And Pito, maybe I can give a couple of additional comments on sort of second half versus first half, which is I think, where you're driving at here. So listen, we've had a great first half, close to 10% revenue growth. But as you think about the second half, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, we had some easier compare in the first half versus 2022. Obviously, we were in the midst of COVID, base business was impacted by that. So there was some easier compare in the first half that we don't expect to repeat in the second half.  On the prepared remarks, we talked about the COVID flu panel, which is about a 1% negative impact on growth in the second half, definitely compared to the first half. We talked about lapping some PLS wins, which also has a muting effect on our growth in the second half. So when you factor all of these combined, obviously, you can look at our implied growth in the second half based on guidance and it's well lower than the first half, and it's driven by some of these factors that I just gave you.  In terms of July, we are still seeing higher than our traditional utilization. So we're still encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of utilization in July. So -- but we're being appropriately conservative in the second half in terms of what the utilization would look like.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: It's Kevin Caliendo. So I guess, if I can just bridge all this, if we just take -- go back to the starting point with 17% and then the operating margin then went to 16.8% with Haystack, now it's 16.5%, and we had this sort of onetime issue in the quarter with DCP, which took that down. But you're also calling out some labor trend issues. Maybe -- is the delta the expectation around the labor cost and churn? Like is there a way to quantify that? And should we expect that to continue going forward? I'm just trying to bridge all of these things and then think about the impact of '24 how we get the sort of margin expansion that was originally expected for '24 with these sort of headwinds that are playing out?
James Davis: Yes, Kevin, let me take the labor piece, and then I'll turn it over to Sam here. So on a previous question, we talked about pre-COVID, our attrition rate of our frontline positions was in the 14% range. In December, Q4 it was 23%. The chart we showed at Investor Day in March, it's slightly better than that. We have quantified it. We've said it's about $8,000 to $10,000 per employee. And in the second half of the year, we think it can be upwards of a $20 million impact versus where we would want it to be at this point in the year.  So now, is the labor market is easy? Unemployment rate sits at 3.6% right now. The Fed has signaled that they're trying to actually get the unemployment rate back upwards of up to 4.1%, 4.5%. The interest rates are going to take a notch up again today. So we think there's going to be easing in the markets going forward, but it's hard to predict. And so right now, I think we're being appropriately conservative on the guidance in the second half.
Sam Samad: Yes. And so Kevin, let me give you some commentary around second half versus first half margins and why you should have confidence in the margin outlook that we gave, the approximately 16.5% for the year.  So first of all, and just to remind everybody, in Q2, our margins expanded by 170 basis points sequentially despite an $80 million drop in COVID, roughly $80 million drop in COVID. So we had some great momentum in terms of operating margin.  As we look towards second half versus first half, here are some of the dynamics that you should factor. Our CIT business, which was net dilutive on operating margins in the first half, becomes accretive in the second half. So we expect to see that business -- as we're very encouraged by the momentum and it becomes actually, it's become profitable in Q2, and it's going to be accretive for the second half of the year. Pricing is a net -- also net accretive and will continue to improve in the second half, and it's definitely a step-up from the first half.  SG&A, we started to achieve those $100 million annualized savings in Q2. And so we expect to achieve the remainder in Q3 and Q4, we didn't have that benefit in Q1 of this year. We talked about DCP, and I don't want to focus too much on that, but it was a headwind in the first half, which we don't expect in the second half. Offsetting that is the fact that we have some lower COVID revenues in the second half because right now per our guidance, we're expecting approximately $40 million in the second half, which is definitely well south of the $160 million that we achieved in the first.  So -- but as you look at this momentum of all of these things, plus the ramp-up of Invigorate improvements that we expect to see in the second half -- and yes, there is some Haystack dilution, which is to the tune of about $0.15 to $0.20 for the year. But as you look at all of these factors, we are very confident about the ability to achieve the outlook that we gave in terms of operating margins.
James Davis: Kevin, the last thing I'd add is when you think about price in this business, we tend to always think about commercial payers, Medicare and Medicaid. You have to remember that there's another $2.5 billion on an annual basis where we price directly to Health Systems, to Physicians. And then we have $800 million worth of other businesses between employer solutions, our drug testing business, our wellness business, and our ExamOne business, which serves life insurance companies.  So we are getting price in those segments of our business. And as Sam indicated, our price performance will be better in the second half than it was in the first half primarily from the lift we're getting on that side of our portfolio.
Operator: And our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: I just want to go back to your earlier comments around value-based care where you talked about leakage out-of-network opportunities. But can you maybe just talk about how you see this over time and how you see the evolution of value-based care as it pertains to lab. Is this a margin-enhancing opportunity or just more of a volume opportunity? One, how do I think about that? And then just secondly, I've heard you talk about the pipeline of Health Systems. Is there any way to size what that current pipeline looks like?
James Davis: Yes. So on the first question, I just want to make sure we're not confusing terminology here, value-based care and value-based incentives. So when we talk about value-based care, these are generally arrangements where Medicare has put lives directly into these ACO reach programs for Medicare Advantage plans delegate lives into large integrated physician groups.  Now in both of those situations, we are contracting directly with these ACO REACH organizations and directly with these large physician groups. And we believe that those value-based care programs that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are driving are very good for the lab business because generally, they delegate lives at a fixed price, and in fact, labs become much more useful in terms of helping physicians ensure that diseases and conditions do not progress. So we feel good about that.  I think what we're generally -- when we talk about the health plans and we talk about these things called value-based incentives. So these are programs that we structure with the health plans to help them reduce leakage to out-of-network labs and to help us redirect requisitions that are flowing into more expensive health system laboratories and have those requisitions flow directly into Quest Diagnostics.  So when we are successful in those efforts, there can be value-based incentives that we earn when we help them earn the -- when we achieve those targets of reducing leakage and moving work from higher-priced hospital labs into independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So we seek to do more of both of those programs, value-based care programs with ACO REACH and these value-based incentive programs with our large payers.
Operator: And our last question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: I have two. First one, a bit higher level, more strategic. So United Healthcare Preferred Lab Network was updated in July. I saw that they removed Mayo, but were there any other notable changes in that contract or your relationship there? And then broadly on that same topic, what's the outlook for other MCO opportunities to narrow networks or move the National Labs like you and LabCorp into, say, more preferred roles? Are there opportunities being discussed in the market today?
James Davis: Yes. So on the first part of your question, we did not note any other notable changes with respect to the preferred lab network. We still remain part of that preferred plan network, and that's our plan going forward. In terms of narrowing networks, when we speak to all our commercial payers, we always think it's better, from their perspective, to have both independent labs in network that actually improves their ability to make sure that requisitions are going to lower cost, lower price environments, which is good for the payer. It's good for the employer, and it's good for the patient. And so we don't see any change in that trend to narrow networks that restrict access to independent laboratories.  Now having said that, there's laboratories that play on the fringe that could be expensive single-type test environments. And I think the payers are always looking at specialty labs versus independent labs that can do some of that specialty work as well.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. My other question, and I apologize if I think you got close to answering this a few times, and I've been toggling a couple of events this morning. But did you quantify or could you quantify the reduction in investment spending seen year-over-year in the second quarter and also the portion of the incremental $100 million plus cost action that you actually captured in 2Q. So we have a sense on what's left for the rest of the year.
Sam Samad: Yes. Sure, Eric. So no, we didn't quantify the reduction in investment spend. We did have lower investment spend in Q2 versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't quantified how much it is.  With regards to the SG&A benefits and the $100 million, I think the assumption that you can make is it's about 1/3 of that $100 million that was realized in Q2 and we expect the same to occur in Q3 and Q4.
James Davis: Yes. I just want to remind, we're going to continue to invest for growth in this business. As we mentioned, again in the script, we've invested in CIT, and we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. We look at a metric called return on ad spend, it's now positive. So we're going to continue to invest there because we believe it's driving growth, and it's now driving profitable growth.  We talked about our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. We're going to continue to invest in that area. These blood-based tests, we have the AB42, 40 test up and running. We have the ApoE up and running. These are blood-based tests. These are going to be more useful than CSF or PET scans and less costly to the environment.  We're going to continue to invest in the molecular side of our business. We're going to continue to invest in the oncology business. And that's going to -- all of these things are going to position us for the higher growth segments of the laboratory industry and ensure our long-term outlook.
Operator: We did have one more question come in. Our last question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: This is John on for Derik. We talked about this quite a bit, but talked about the focus of the M&A pipeline will be on the deals you've traditionally done before. And it seems you certainly have plenty to come in the coming quarters and you have lots of balance. And of course, you're investing in Alzheimer's portfolio and whatnot. But as you look to launch your first MRD product in 2024, could you talk about potential deals or products that you can -- you see would complement your current oncology portfolio that you don't have in your current internal pipeline?
James Davis: Well, we think with the combination of Haystack, which, as you noted, is centered on minimally residual disease testing post cancer diagnosis. And we brought up our own internal assay for therapy selection. So from a therapy monitoring and therapy selection standpoint, we believe we're very well positioned for future growth. We continue to invest on the genetics side of our business, hereditary genetics, genetic offerings for diagnostic purposes and then the family planning and prenatal genetics is also an area that continues to receive focus.  So we believe we're well positioned on the cancer side. We continue to make some investments on the genetic side and that's where the -- we think we're well positioned. Now again, our focus right now, we'll continue to focus on hospital outreach deals and other small tuck-ins that are accretive to our business.
Operator: That was our last question.
James Davis: All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We -- again, I believe we had a strong quarter here. The outlook for the second half. We've taken up our revenue guidance, feel good about that, and thank you for supporting Quest Diagnostics. Have a great day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and thank you all for standing by. Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer portion. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I’m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We’re off to a strong start in 2023. Our base business grew double digit compared to prior year, driven by strong performance across physician and health system lab services. This morning we announced the acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Later in my remarks I’ll describe how this transaction is aligned to the molecular genomics and oncology strategy we shared last month at Investor Day and how it positions us well in the fast-growing category of minimal residual disease testing. Now, turning to the first quarter. Total revenues were $2.3 billion. Total base business revenue grew 10%, supported by base business volume growth of nearly 8%. And earnings per share were a $1.78 on a reported basis and $2.4 on an adjusted basis. Now, let's look at some of the highlights from the quarter. The strong volume growth we experienced in our base business across all customer types, points to a continued return to care in the quarter. We saw a faster growth in number of test per requisition across a broad range of clinical test categories. This suggests more people are returning to the healthcare system for routine care after delaying care during the pandemic. Health plan volumes also continue to grow faster than the overall business. This trend is directly related to our ongoing efforts to partner with health plans to actively steer patients to high quality, lower-cost providers like Quest, thereby saving money for the health plan, employers and plan members. During the first quarter, base revenues from health systems grew approximately 7%. At Investor Day, we said this book of business would grow at about 5% to 6% CAGR, and we're having success across the board with new wins in our reference and professional lab services offerings. Some of these highlights include: in February, we announced that we're helping Tower Health in Pennsylvania manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing. Our Northern Light Health PLS relationship began to ramp up in the quarter. Northern Light is a large integrated health system in Maine, where we are providing services for all nine of its hospital labs and its cancer center. We also closed our acquisition of Northern Lights outreach lab assets. Finally, we completed our strategic laboratory services acquisition with NewYork-Presbyterian, with new test volumes starting to flow into our Clifton, New Jersey laboratory earlier this month. This is the third outreach acquisition we completed in the last six months. As we enter the second quarter, our pipeline of new health system business remains strong, including many additional PLS opportunities. Now I'd like to say a few words about our announcement this morning regarding our planned acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Haystack is an early stage oncology company, focused on minimal residual disease, or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive liquid biopsy technology that can detect circulating DNA from residual or recurring tumor cells. The technology was licensed from Johns Hopkins where it was developed by genomics and cancer pioneers. Most patients treated for cancer must be monitored for years following surgery and initial treatment. This is because there’s always the potential that some cancer was missed and may recur. At Investor Day we talked about Quest’s strong position in the mature cancer areas of screening and diagnosis and that we will also play a leading roll in therapy selection with our TSO500 assay. Haystack liquid biopsy technology, combined with our strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing will now position us to play a leading roll in a fast growing MRD category. We expect to focus initially on colorectal, breast and lung cancers and to start generating revenue next year. We are also encouraged by other recent developments in advanced diagnostics. In the area of brain health we saw strong growth which we attribute largely to Quest AD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test. This proprietary test launched last year, helps us assess the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We are now introducing additional tests to help us assess the inherited risk of Alzheimer's and provide personalized recommendations to lower risk. We also saw strong growth in our advanced cardiometabolic portfolio; prenatal genetics, our blood-based tuberculosis screening and hepatitis B and C testing. We are encouraged by the CDC's recent decision to recommend one-time screening for hepatitis B. In consumer health, we continue to add to our test menu with new services, including long COVID and menopause testing. We also generated strong year-over-year volume growth in allergy and general health testing, as consumers utilize our offerings as a complement to the care provided by their physician. In the coming months, we plan to launch a new consumer genetics panel as well. Turning to Invigorate. We are well on our way toward achieving our 3% annual productivity savings target. Here are some recent examples among the many contributors. We are improving the efficiency of our patient services network. In some cases, we're closing smaller draw sites and adding staff to larger, higher volume locations. At the same time, we're making it easier for walk-ins to register and be seen through our schedule at check-in service. We are adding new features to the pre-registration process, which improves both collections and patient convenience. During the pandemic, we relied heavily on third-party logistics to supplement our own team's collections of COVID-19 test and other specimens. COVID-19 volumes have declined and the labor market eases, we are reducing our dependence on these vendors, which will generate savings for our logistics operations. Finally, we're continuing to enhance our labor staffing models across our lab network to reflect post-pandemic total volumes and drive productivity. As we have said before, we continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. The actions we've taken will start to help margins beginning in the second quarter. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on where we are with Medicare clinical lab fee schedule cuts. As you know, PAMA cuts were suspended for 2023. We strongly support the recent bipartisan reintroduction of the legislation in Congress to fix PAMA through the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act, or SALSA. We are working with our trade association on driving advocacy for SALSA through a campaign to stop lab cuts, aimed at congressional outreach on the importance of lab services. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 10.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 10% to $2.21 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% and to $119 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 11.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services, versus the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 3.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 10 basis points to total volume. In the quarter, total base testing volumes grew 7.9% versus the prior year. Recall, our base testing volumes in the first quarter of last year were negatively impacted by surge in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the Omicron variant. If we normalize for the impact of the easier comps due to the Omicron surge in Q1 2022, we estimate base volume growth at approximately 4%. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the first quarter. We resulted approximately 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter, down approximately 5 million tests versus Q1 of 2022. The Revenue per requisition declined 7.7% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.3%, due primarily to more tests per acquisition, as well as positive payer and test mix. Unit price was roughly flat, which was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $305 million or 13.1% of revenues compared to $513 million or 19.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $350 million or 15% of revenues compared to $554 million or 21.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Reported EPS was $1.78 in the quarter compared to $2.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04 compared to $3.22 last year. Cash from operations was $94 million in the first quarter versus $480 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and an additional payroll cycle during the quarter versus the prior year. Now turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $8.93 billion and $9.08 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.78 billion and $8.88 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $8.02 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.45 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We have lowered our COVID-19 revenue guidance, which now assumes very modest COVID-19 revenue following the end of the public health emergency in May. COVID 19 molecular volumes have declined faster than we expected over the last several weeks. And we now expect minimal volume contribution from the retail channel post PHE. We have raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect stronger base volume trends and the recent close of the NewYork-Presbyterian transaction. We expect the Haystack Oncology transaction to close in the second quarter. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the expected dilution from this transaction in 2023. We expect this deal to be modestly dilutive to EPS over the next three years and accretive to earnings by 2026. We anticipate Haystack Oncology to begin contributing revenue in 2024 and to have a positive ROIC by the end of 2025. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we're off to a strong start in 2023 and our base business grew double digits compared to prior year. We are excited about our announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. With Haystack, we expect to build on our strengths in cancer screening and diagnosis to play a leading role in the higher growth areas of MRD detection. And finally, we're well on our way toward generating our targeted 3% Invigorate savings and productivity improvements. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Great. Thank you. My question is focused on the base volume growth, which was strong. And in your commentary, you talked about health plans that you're gaining more market share there and you are winning more market share, I think you said with, reference labs. So maybe can you give us more detail on that? Is it existing health care partners? Do you have a new health care partner? Is your relationship with existing partners may be changing? And I'm just trying to figure out how much is a return to normal versus maybe actual market share you could be gaining? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes. Hey, thanks, Ann and good morning. So our growth in the quarter, again, 10% base revenue growth was strong across all channels, our physician segment and our health systems segment. Now within the health systems segment, we look at our reference business and our PLS business. Our reference business was powered by growth from existing accounts as well as we had several new big wins that, we actually win those deals in previous quarters, but the start-up was in the first quarter. On the PLS side, our professional lab services, our growth at existing site same-store sales was very strong. But we also added, as you know, a couple of new PLS sites, both in the fourth quarter that were ramping up and in the first quarter. Those were Lee Health in Florida, as I mentioned in the script, Tower Health and then Northern Light in Maine, a multi-hospital health system up in Northern Maine continued to wrap up in the first quarter. So broad-based growth, physician business was very strong, health system business strong and PLS certainly helped the average growth rate in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. This might be one for Sam. Just on the margin side. As we look at the base margins back in COVID, shaking out somewhere around 13%. I guess when you look at the go forward, even getting into next year, kind of approaching that 17% type number. Can you just talk about -- I don't know if it's a bridge or just the progression towards that how you work your way towards that, particularly as COVID continues to come out of the model a little bit. I just want to focus on that base margin piece and how we think about the step up there.
Sam Samad: Sure, Patrick and good morning. Thanks for the question. So listen, we had 15% operating margins in Q1. I'll talk about some of the drivers in terms of -- to your question, looking forward and how we get to that approximately 17% that we guided to on Investor Day, and we're still committed to that approximately 17% number that we guided for 2023. So here are some key drivers. First of all, Q1 margins came in on the base business strong. And, overall, as expected, we had a negative impact from COVID revenues, both coming down more precipitously than expected, but also the mix on COVID. We saw more testing done at the PLS sites that at other sites, which are lower cost for us. But in terms of Q1, came in as expected. As we look forward, we start to see a few things help margins. First of all, keep in mind, Q1 is usually our weakest quarter as well. But as we look forward, you expect Invigorate savings to or productivity improvements to ramp up, and that has already started but will ramp up over the course of the year. We set our SG&A reductions of approximately $100 million will really take effect more so in Q2 onwards. And so, that will help margins going forward as well. We're seeing, as I said, good strong base business growth and volume that's going to help us. We're seeing good tailwind from pricing. Our pricing environment is the best that it's ever been. We're seeing a modest benefit from pricing this year compared to the 50 basis point headwind that we saw last year. And before that, we used to have even more headwind than that. So all of those factors, as you look forward in terms of productivity, in terms of SG&A improvement, in terms of volume growth, give us confidence about getting to that 17%.
Jim Davis: Yes. The last thing I'd add, Patrick, is our test mix in the quarter was strong. Our investments in advanced diagnostics continue to pay off. We saw, as I said in the script, really nice growth in advanced cardiometabolic testing, prenatal genetics, hep B, hep C. So these are all margin accretive types of tests. So we feel good about that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A question for you guys. As I think about the call out you made on test per req being up in the quarter. Maybe if you can give us some color on what is driving that and how you think that will progress going forward? Yes, that's all. Thank you.
Jim Davis: So I think there's evidence of a strong return to care. So I just said that our advanced testing portfolio was certainly up in the quarter. We also saw just strong growth in routine testing, routine cardiometabolic, lipid panels, chemistry panels and things like that. Generally, general health and wellness visit has high test per req, because you're testing across the entire human body. So I think our test per req were really powered by that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk more about your visibility into pricing and contract renewals, particularly with payers this year, should have -- how far along are you in terms of the renewals and sort of what incrementally have you been seeing? Or is it sort of similar to what you called out on current trends? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Sure. So I think as everybody knows, in general, our contracts with commercial payers average three to five years. So on average, every year, we're going to renegotiate about 25% of our health plans contracts. We're now a-third of the way through the year, and we've progressed nicely on two of the contracts that have been renewed. We have a few more to do throughout the rest of the year. So what I would tell you is, look, we have a great value story. Consistently, we're able to move requisitions from high-priced institutions, health systems and out-of-network labs into Quest Diagnostics. And we try to negotiate incentives for doing that. And when we do that work, we get paid incremental value. So these value-based contracts are on the rise. And we certainly make the case around inflation and things like that. But as I've said in the past, we don't lead with that. We lead with the fact that we offer great value, and we want to get paid for that value. So negotiations are going well. We said in the quarter that price was flat, which we haven't been able to say in a long time. Q4, we were down 50 basis points. Q1 we're flat. So we continue to make improvement and expect to make improvement throughout the rest of the year.
Elizabeth Anderson : Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Haystack acquisition. Can you maybe talk through the process there, why now, why this company? Talk through any -- I know there's some regulatory and commercial milestones this company has coming up? And also, maybe just talk through how we should think about the dilution in terms of modeling it and where would show up through the P&L.
Jim Davis: Yes. So let me just have Sam address the dilution first, and then I'll come back and talk about why Haystack and why now, Sam?
Sam Samad: Yes. So, Kevin, first of all, thanks for the question. So we said this deal will be modestly dilutive this year and modestly dilutive for the next three years and will be actually accretive for us in terms of earnings in 2026. We haven't shared exactly how dilutive of it is for 2023. But let me give you a couple of, maybe, nuggets or qualitative directional comments. First of all, in terms of our overall guidance, as you saw, we kept our guidance midpoint the same. We narrowed the guidance by $0.10 on EPS, so I'm referring here specifically to adjusted EPS. And the drivers of that were, improved base business, which is taking us higher, lower COVID, which is going the other way, and some modest dilution from the Haystack acquisition. But all in all, if you put all those together, we're still at the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance that we were last quarter. In terms of going forward, the annualized EPS dilution from Haystack next year is actually less than what we expect to see this year. So it starts to improve. It's -- next year is the peak dilution for the deal. And in 2025, the dilution is lower. So it's actually a year-over-year EPS improvement. And then in 2026, as I said, it's accretive for us from an EPS perspective. ROIC wise, as I said, it turns positive by the end of 2025. And we expect it to have a -- it definitely clears our hurdle for ROIC expectations in the next five years.
Jim Davis: Yes. So Kevin, let me talk a little bit now about why Haystack and why now. So first, as we talked about at Investor Day, when we are looking to close a capability gap, if you will, in our portfolio, the first thing we do is we reach out to our IBD partners. And over the last several years, we've had deep discussions. We know what their road maps are. And we didn't think that was a pathway to follow to get into this space, at least in the next several years, let's just say. Over the last three years, we've had many discussions with many of the players in the MRD space. We got to know Haystack over the last year. We think they have the lowest limit of detection of any MRD assay out there. In terms of just raw numbers, they can detect one part per million, meaning you have 1 million floating dead cells, as they die they release DNA, the fragments of DNA and there's a lot of DNA in your bloodstream and these guys with this assay can find one fragment of cancer DNA per 1 million parts. That is an incredibly low limit of detection. The sensitivity of the assay at Landmark is very, very high, 80% to 90%. And so we think it's a best-in-class assay. The work they've done on some of their preliminary trials, 450 patients across 23 Australian centers. I'd refer you to the New England Journal of Medicine article in June of 2022. So we think it's the right assay, the right time. As you know, CMS is reimbursing for these assays, and we think we can scale it. We think we can drive further commercial reimbursement. The last thing I would say is, look, it is a tumor-informed assay and when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, hence their name, when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, you actually want to know what the needle looks like. And hence, we believe that a tumor-informed assay is a much stronger assay than an uninformed assay.
Sam Samad: One other thing, just to wrap up on the financials. Kevin, back to your question around dilution. I do want to mention, for the longer term, we are committed to the Investor Day guidance that we gave around long-range guidance, which said mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit EPS growth. The Haystack acquisition actually modestly improves on that as well. So I just wanted to provide this for the long-term guidance, given that we just shared at an Investor Day not too long ago
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to stick with the Haystack deal. Very interesting, great tech, pricing is pretty reasonable with other deals in the space. I had a few more questions for you. First is in terms of coverage, just wanted to confirm, I assume, is the plan to go through Moldex there? Then number two, do you think reimbursement looks similar to other MRD tests on the market? And then finally, can you just comment, are there any royalties attached to the deal? Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yes. So, yes, Jack, first, thanks for the question. Yes, on Moldex absolutely plan to go that route. Look, what we have to do is finish the commercialization of the assay. We'll be doing that for the rest of this year. We plan on bringing the assay up in one of our large oncology testing facilities. As you know, there is limited coverage for Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients, as dictated by CMS. Two companies have coverage for that today. I would also tell you, there's a handful of Blues company -- the Blues plans that are reimbursing for the test. So similar to NIPT -- remember, NIPT started out very high-risk women, very limited coverage. And we, as well some other industry members drove that throughout the commercial payers. And that test is wide open to women today. So that's our plan. On the royalty question, look, as we mentioned in the comments, the -- some of the original IP came out of John Hopkins. I'm not going to disclose royalty payments. But as you can imagine, there's intellectual property that comes with this, and there's modest royalties that will come with it.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Two part question. Just first on basic routine testing. Where are we now relative to pre-COVID baseline levels? Are we fully back to normal here? And then on capital deployment, I understand there's a balance of capital deployment dedicated to the innovation assets like Haystack, but how rich is the pipeline now for the tuck-in deals around hospitals, or local players and have you seen any changes in the urgency around those types of deals? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes. So our routine testing levels are above pre-COVID levels, whether you look at our volume versus all of 2019 or you look at our volume versus the first two months of 2020, we're substantially above that. So the recovery is no longer really even a topic of discussion for us. In terms of the funnel of opportunities on the health system side, namely outreach deals is stronger than ever. And I think now that COVID is behind us, the deal completion will start to accelerate. So we feel good about what's in the funnel. They generally take a while to negotiate. You got to get a lot of people on board, pathologists on board, referring physicians. But once you get them all on board, it can move quickly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Kieran Ryan: Hi, there. You've got Kieran Ryan on here for Pito. Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to margins, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about FTE wage inflation, hiring and turnover, how that ran in 1Q compared to what you're seeing in the second half of 2022? And then, just kind of how that fits into getting back to that 17% margin next year?
Sam Samad: Yes. So the guidance we gave for the year, we said our wage inflation would be in the 3% to 4% range. No surprises there. We still feel good about that overall guidance that we set for the year. Our turnover rates have improved from Q1 of last year. Sequentially, for most job categories, it improved from Q4 to Q1. And we continue to see the trend back towards a normalized attrition rate. When I say normalized, sort of, pre-COVID levels. It is not yet back to those levels unlike volume, but it is trending in the right direction, and we feel good about where our wage inflation was in the first quarter and for the year.
Jim Davis: Yes. And I'll just mention a couple of things real quick. I mean, productivity in terms of the Invigorate actions that we have, helps also offset that, which is how we get to the margin target that we have. And I think you mentioned, Kieran, the 17% next year, actually, our guidance is to get to approximately 17% this year in terms of operating margin. So I just want to be clear on that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next comes…
Shawn Bevec: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Brackmann: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to go back to Haystack for a minute and appreciate all the commentary today on that. But can you maybe just sort of talk about any expectations for a halo effect that this can create for you guys commercially. And I guess, just as you sort of think about that, how are you thinking about any changes to the commercial strategy, just between calling on pathologists and then the oncologist here. Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes. It’s a good question. Absolutely, a halo effect. Remember at Investor Day, we said in 2022, ex-COVID, we had $8.4 billion in revenue. And of that $8.4 billion, $1 billion of that is in the cancer space. And we said about half of that or $0.5 billion is in the screening space, routine screening, PSA, Pap Smear, HPV, some common cancer markers, but we then said that the other $0.5 billion is anatomical pathology. So we have the -- and once we have that specimen, it's only logical for the medical oncologists to start to, once it's declared cancer -- the next question, post surgery is there still cancer cells in this human being, or the next question, if the answer to that is yes, and then there's therapy. The next question is, did the therapy work? Do we still see remnants of DNA from the tumor. So we think this absolutely fits into our overall cancer strategy and Quest Diagnostics today. In particular, again, there is a halo effect. We will own the block, we will own the specimen and doing the testing on that for both treatment monitoring as well as treatment selection, we think, is just a natural. Now, from a commercial standpoint, we have a pretty mature oncology distribution today that calls on pathologists and medical oncologists. And, yes, we are absolutely going to strengthen the team as we finish the commercialization of this assay and to have a more robust channel calling into the medical oncologist space. So good question. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe two quick ones here, if I could slip them in. A strong rebound in the base business line. We've talked for a while about the fact that the New York region had not come back as quickly as other regions. Did you see any outsized performance there that's contributing to the strong base business? Or was the strength pretty much across the board geographically. And then you didn't do anything on the buyback front this quarter. I know you've Haystack now and you've got hospital deals. I wondered what's your thought about additional share repurchases as we progress through the year.
Jim Davis: Yes. Thanks, A.J. So, on your first question, I'll let Sam take the second part. Again, 10% revenue growth on the base business in the quarter, 8% volume growth. I mentioned that health systems was 7%. So our physician book of business actually grew higher than that, if you do that math. And the answer is, we saw strong growth across all of our regions. Did the Northeast grow at a faster rate? Slightly faster rate, yes. So we saw maybe a bit of a rebound there. But look, our comparisons now in the Northeast region are with 2022. There's been population shifts that some of that population is just not going to come back to the Northeast. Now, we see a stronger growth -- continued stronger growth in the Southeast and the Southwest, and that very much could represent some population shift that we're seeing in the country. The last thing I'd mention, although it didn't influence our Q1 numbers, we did mention the startup of our NewYork-Presbyterian outreach deal that's going well. It's going to be a strong contributor to growth in the East region and will be a strong contributor to our overall growth for the rest of the year. So Sam, do you want to take that?
Sam Samad: Yes. And thanks, A.J. On the buyback, so what's assumed in our guidance in terms of adjusted EPS is that we will offset equity dilution in terms of share buybacks. So we'll do enough to offset equity dilution. We are still committed to returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So that's still our commitment. We communicated it on our Investor Day. We're obviously still committed to it. But we also said that we're going to scale share buybacks up and down depending on also the M&A pipeline and the impact that might have on growth and driving our strategy and also our long-term growth. We had -- in the quarter, we talked about -- or at least, recently, we talked about NewYork-Presbyterian and the fact that, that's a $275 million capital deployment. We talked about now today, Haystack and that's an additional capital deployment of $300 million. So we've got good progress here on the M&A front. So that's also why we didn't do any share buyback in Q1.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is John [ph] on for Derek.
Jim Davis: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about the consumer initiated testing business. in terms of contribution, if you're allowed to say how much contribution you saw monthly in terms of sales and how much of an impact has made on the margins. Just curious if that’s something I should look out for in terms of the margin progression here. Thank you.
Jim Davis: Yes. So we are really happy with our consumer-initiated testing performance in the quarter. It showed nice growth from progressive growth from Q4. And so, I'm going to talk about the growth. COVID obviously declined in that segment of our business as well. The majority of our CIT business now is our routine base business. We saw a nice progression from Q4 to Q1. We are happy with that. We saw a nice progression Q1 to Q1, really nice progression there. We continue to be excited about a couple of growth categories within CIT. Number one, you probably read allergy season has really taken off and taken off early. So seeing some nice growth there. Just our general health and wellness offering in CIT was really strong in the quarter. And we surveyed some of those general health and wellness customers and found some interesting things. One of the main reasons they're coming to Quest and paying out of pocket is because patients were -- consumers, patients were having a hard time getting in to see their physicians. We're hearing about three-month delays to get to see their doctor. So rather than wait to see their doctor and get their lab testing, they just come in, because they want to know. And then finally, I'd say, our STD category continues to exhibit very strong growth. The CDC just declared again several types of STDs, gonorrhoea, syphilis at epidemic levels. They also indicated that 50% of all new cases that they're seeing across the country are aged 15 to 24. And that's a segment that wants to remain anonymous and just pay out of pocket for lots of reasons. Finally, as we've said about margins, our CIP business is going to be less dilutive this year than it was last year. And I think you can assume that each quarter through the year.
Sam Samad: Yes. So, John, just to add to that, it is dilutive in Q1 to margins. But as Jim said, it's going to improve throughout the year. So that's another aspect of why our margins overall improve, although this one is more modest.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, are there any more questions?
Jim Davis: All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today, some really exciting news here, but let me just summarize. Look, we're off to a really strong start here in 2023. Our base business performed stronger than expected, stronger than we expected in the quarter. We feel really, really good about that. and it's certainly offsetting some of the COVID decline that we saw in the quarter. Second, hopefully, you can tell, we're really excited about the Haystack Oncology. We think the technology is the right technology, but more importantly, it's the right team. We are really impressed with the team that will join Quest Diagnostics. And as you know, in these types of acquisitions, it's not just investing in the technology, we’re really investing in a group of people and a team, and we feel really, really good about that. We feel great about the MRD space and we believe it's starting to mature from both a physician ordering perspective as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And then, finally, we're well on our way to generating the Invigorate savings that are needed to offset wage inflation, and we feel good about the progress we're making there. So, again, thanks for joining in, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road over the next few months and joining us at our next earnings call in July. So thanks for joining, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2002 conference call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question and answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution of retransmission of the rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President, Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m joined by Jim Davis, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Quest had a strong year in 2022 with base business revenues growing more than 6% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. As we expected COVID-19 testing revenues declined but still exceeded $1.4 billion in 2022. Our strong performance over the last several years would not have been possible without the commitment and compassion of our nearly 50,000 colleagues who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 while growing our base business. I am incredibly proud of how this team has worked together during an unprecedented period in the lab industry to deliver insights to help create a healthier world. This morning, I’ll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our 2023 guidance. In the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.3 billion, earnings per share were $0.87 on a reported basis and $1.98 on an adjusted basis, cash from operations was $334 million. For the full year 2022, total revenues were $9.9 billion, including more than $8.4 billion in base business revenue. Earnings per share were $7.97 on a reported basis and $9.95 on an adjusted basis. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. As you saw this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 8% to $0.71 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.  Before discussing additional highlights for 2022, I’d like to share some recent positive regulatory updates. First, Congress delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2023, which would have impacted our revenue between approximately $80 million and $85 million. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA. Second, CMS increased Medicare reimbursement for specimen collection fees for the first time in nearly 40 years. This could provide Quest with a benefit of approximately $35 million to $40 million this year. Regarding COVID-19 testing revenues, while we did see a steady ramp upward in COVID-19 volumes throughout Q4, our volumes have steadily declined since late December. We expect our COVID-19 revenues to be significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We have lowered our prior COVID-19 volume expectations in 2023 from 10,000 to 15,000 molecular tests per day to 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day. In addition, we continue to negotiate coverage and reimbursement policies with commercial payors following the end of the PHE in May. I will now share some recent highlights in how we are growing this business. In the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Suma Health, a large integrated health system serving communities in northeastern Ohio. We also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of Northern Light Health’s outreach laboratory services business located in Maine. We will also provide professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light’s hospital laboratories along with its cancer center lab. Our M&A pipeline is strong, including potential deals with health systems, small regional labs, and other capability-building assets. In particular, the funnel of opportunities with health systems, which are facing major margin pressures due to labor challenges and mix shift from inpatient to outpatient care, is very active. Quest can help through lab management, population health analytics, mobile services, and/or by monetizing their outreach business. In health plans, we continue to gain traction with value-based contracts where we see meaningfully higher growth than with traditional contracts. Also, we’ve started to benefit from incentives related to these value-based contracts which helps demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships. With CMS’ recent increase in Medicare reimbursement for specimen collections, we’ve begun discussions with our health plan customers about getting paid appropriately for the phlebotomy services we provide to their members. Higher specimen collection fees enable us to make continuous investment in patient services so their members continue to have the broadest access to high quality and low cost lab testing. In advanced diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services in 2022. In 2022, we also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This 523 gene test relies upon the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 assay to help oncologists with therapy selection by providing comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient’s tumor. This test extends our capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, we continued to make investments to strengthen our bio-informatics capabilities which support some of the faster growing opportunities of our portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, and pharma services. We also invested in our women’s health sales force which will position us well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics.  We continue to make progress executing our consumer initiated testing strategy. Last year, we recorded approximately $96 million of both base and COVID-19 consumer testing. In the fall of 2022, we launched our new digital platform, QuestHealth.com. Consumers have found this to be a simpler, more intuitive way to order lab tests. Following the launch of our new consumer sight, we began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter. We saw some of the strongest order volumes to date following some Cyber Monday promotional advertising, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of growth in base testing in December. Shifting to operational excellence, in 2022 we approached our goal of 3% productivity improvements and savings through our Invigorate program. Those savings and productivity improvements did not completely offset the inflationary pressures in our business, as well as the impact of a modest unit price decline. Following the pandemic, we like many companies have faced significant inflation and wage pressures. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business.  We continue to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Last year, we began a new automation conversion project in our Lenexa laboratory. This new project builds on what work we’ve done in our Marlborough and Clifton labs. We’ve introduced a new microbiology platform that is highly automated and makes use of artificial intelligence to assist with sample analysis. Finally, we’ve begun to realize savings from the urinalysis platform conversion that we announced early last year.  Filling and retaining our frontline positions continues to be a key priority for us. Although we have experienced higher than average turnover in some of our job categories, we have taken actions to stabilize our workforce and improve frontline employee engagement and retention. We expect these actions to help enhance our productivity in 2023. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. With that, I’ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2023 guidance. Sam?
Sam Samad: Thanks Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to $2.15 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 75% to $184 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with acquisitions contributing 20 basis points to total volume.  For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter, which together represented a volume headwind of more than 1.5%.  COVID-19 testing volumes contributed to the decline during the fourth quarter. We resulted approximately 1.9 molecular tests in the quarter. This was down 1.2 million tests versus the third quarter and down approximately 5.4 million tests versus Q4 of 2021. After rising modestly throughout the fourth quarter, our COVID-19 molecular volumes declined to an average of roughly 17,000 tests per day in January and currently make up less than 3% of our daily volumes. In the fourth quarter, revenue per requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 6.8%. This strong increase in revenue per req was driven by a number of factors, including test and payor mix, the more favorable pricing environment with health plans, including incentives under our value-based contracts, and lower patient concessions. Unit price reimbursement pressure remained consistent with our expectations at approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $135 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to $536 million or 19.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $330 million or 14.2% of revenues compared to $579 million or 21.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant increase in employee healthcare costs.  Reported EPS was $0.87 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.12 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.98 compared to $3.33 last year. Cash from operations was $1.72 billion for full year 2022 versus $2.23 billion in the prior year period.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $8.83 billion and $9.03 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $175 million and $275 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.61 to $8.21, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.40 to $9. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  For our 2023 guidance, please consider the following. As Jim highlighted, we are now assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day for the full year. We expect volumes to continue to decline through the spring and summer but could see a modest uptick during respiratory season in Q4. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to continue near recent levels through the end of the PHE.  CMS has indicated that reimbursements will be $51 when the PHE expires in May. We continue to negotiate with health plans regarding coverage policies and reimbursements for COVID-19 testing post-PHE. Note that our COVID-19 testing revenue guidance for 2023 is approximately $150 million lower than the expectations we had back in October. With COVID-19 testing becoming a significantly smaller portion of our overall business, we expect an earnings cadence that is more in line with pre-pandemic seasonality this year, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year at roughly 22% to 23% of full year earnings.  We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. The benefit of these actions will be modest in Q1 and will expand in the second quarter.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.
Jim Davis: Thanks Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong growth of 5% in our base business in 2022. COVID testing revenues as expected declined last year and will represent a significantly smaller portion of our business going forward. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy during our upcoming investor day on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange. Look for an announcement soon with more details on this event. Now we’d be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator instructions] The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. 
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. Thank you.  Maybe if we talk about major assumptions in the low end of guidance versus what’s embedded in the high end of guidance. Can you also discuss the incremental $115 million to $125 million that is now benefiting 2023 versus when you reiterated that mid-$8 range back in Q3 earnings? How much has fallen to the bottom line, and how much do you expect to reinvest in the business? Thanks. 
Jim Davis: Yes, let me just speak first about the revenue guidance. As we indicated in the remarks, our COVID guidance, which had originally been 10,000 to 15,000 requisitions per day in ’23, we’ve revised that downward to 5,000 to 10,000 per day, and it’s really just based on the trends we’re seeing. It peaked in December. We averaged roughly 17,000 a day here in January, but that’s had a downward slope, so we continue to expect COVID volumes to decline and it’s really had about $150 million change in revenue versus what we thought last fall. Again, the guidance we’ve suggested - you know, a midpoint of about $225 million in COVID revenue for the year. On the base business, without acquisition help, we’ve assumed a 2.5% to 3% revenue growth on the total base business, so really that’s the explanation on the revenue side.
Sam Samad: Yes, so maybe I’ll add a couple of comments, Ann, and thank you for the question - this is Sam.  Versus what we shared back when we talked about in Q3 of 2022 around the fact that we were somewhere in that 850 range, obviously some positives that you mentioned, which is I think what you are referring to as the $115 million to $125 million, which includes the PAMA delay, which includes also the reimbursement of the specimen collection fees, which we now benefit from. But there are a couple of things also that have changed to the negative, really the key one being--or just one thing, really, that’s changed to the negative, I should say, which is COVID.  The COVID assumptions that we had back then were, as Jim just said, 10,000 to 15,000 a day. Now we’re seeing volumes, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, 17,000 a day in January, and January is typically around the peak of the respiratory season and then it starts to come down from there, so our expectations of 10,000 to 15,000 a day for the year are, I would say, realistic. But in terms of the range itself and what differentiates the bottom versus the top, I think it’s going to be really around the COVID assumptions. But again, keep in mind we’ve taken COVID down by $150 million in terms of total revenues versus what we really shared back in October, when we expected 10,000 to 15,000. We’ve also--from the benefit itself, you know, the $115 million to $125 million that you referenced, we’ve also carved out a small amount for investments in the business, strategic investments that, as we said a couple of months ago, we said we will reserve some of that benefit to invest in the business for long term growth.
Ann Hynes: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you. Margins came in a little light of where we were expecting 4Q. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there between DTC growth investments, inflation, pricing; and then going into ’23, it seems like the base business margins need to step up - you know, you called out the $100 million SG&A cut. Are you guys changing any plans for DTC investments? Just want to get comfortable with that margin bridge from the lower 4Q number and the moving pieces. Thank you. 
Sam Samad: Sure Patrick, yes, and thank you for the question. Let me talk a little bit about Q4 and the margin rate in Q4, the 14.2%. Here are some of the headwinds, some of which we were seeing throughout the year, but obviously we also had a drop in COVID revenues in Q4 which was significant versus Q3, at least sequentially, which impacted the margin as well.  In terms of the margin rate itself, we had inflation, I would say per expectations but still elevated. We had growth investments of roughly about $40 million that impacted Q4, which were fairly in line with Q3, what we had in terms of investments, so not necessarily a sequential driver. One driver in Q4 that impacted our margin rate was higher employee healthcare cost. That was higher than our expectations and some of it driven by higher utilization, especially towards the end of the year after employees have met their deductibles, but also higher cost of healthcare in general. That was about 80 basis points of impact on the quarter in terms of negative rate impact, so that was another thing. I talked about--obviously if you’re looking at things sequentially, you have to factor in that COVID revenues were $184 million roughly versus approximately $313 million in Q3, so a big drop in COVID revenues. Now if you look prospectively in 2023, here are some of the things that obviously give us confidence that we can achieve the rate that we have in our projections and that’s factored into the guidance that we gave. We have taken $100 million in SG&A reductions, and I would say 90% of those have already been implemented. Now, you won’t see the benefit starting in Q1, you’ll probably see it in the latter part of Q1 and really taking effect in Q2 more fully, but that’s $100 million in SG&A reductions that we expect to see over the course of this year. In terms of investments, you referenced that, we expect investments to be less dilutive in 2023 versus 2022, because we start to see the benefit from some of these investments towards the growth of our business. Then finally, obviously the margin rate is going to benefit from the specimen collection fee reimbursement that we have, and we have a volume growth assumption as well and a revenue growth assumption that at the midpoint of the guidance range is, on base business, approximately 3%, and so that’s going to drive also additional margin improvement based on the drop-down from those revenues.
Patrick Donnelly: That’s helpful, thanks Sam.
Sam Samad: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. I had a few questions on Quest Health. First, of the $96 million you talked about of sales, is there a breakdown you can share of COVID versus base; then second, on the base sales, how did that ramp after the fall push? Then finally, just what are your expectations for consumer initiated testing revenue and investment for 2023?
Jim Davis: Yes, so Jack, let me start. On CIT, our consumer initiated testing business, the total $96 million, more of it was COVID than our base business; however, our base business, once we launched the new platform, once we launched the marketing spend actually performed as expected in November and December. We got significant growth year-over-year, over 50% growth in the month of December based on the initiatives we put in place.  As we’ve said, this year we expect that business to be less dilutive versus 2022. In terms of the total revenue projection for CIT, you know, we’ll give you something at investor day. Obviously COVID will significantly ramp down, but we expect our base to significantly ramp up, and we’ll give you a better view of that at investor day.
Jack Meehan: Great, and then one follow-up on COVID. If we do a look back on 2022, is it possible to call out how much of the sales came from serology, your CDC contract or anything outside of the core molecular, and just what you’re assuming there for 2023?
Jim Davis: Here’s what I’d say. As we indicated, the volume is coming down, right - we said 10 to 15 last fall, we now expect 5 to 10 for the year. The one thing I’ll say on serology, we had a significant contract with the CDC, it was simply a test add-on seroprevalence study. That contract, as expected, ended in December. The CDC just doesn’t need that information anymore. What does remain, in addition to the PCR volume, is we’ve got a roughly $25 million contract with the CDC to do continuous sequencing work of the positive cases to help inform the CDC and others about the spread or development of new variants that continue to pop up.
Jack Meehan: Super, thank you Jim.
Jim Davis: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
AJ Rice: Yes, hi everybody. Thanks. Obviously there continues to be a steady pipeline of hospital-related deals. Can you tell us whether--I know your closest peer is announcing transactions too. Do you see any change in the competitive landscape for those deals, on the terms on which those deals are being done? You also mentioned seeing some more activity in small regional labs. What do you attribute that to - is it COVID testing is as running off, are you seeing some of the regional labs express more interest in potentially aligning with you?
Jim Davis: Yes AJ, thanks for the question. I would tell you no, there’s no real change in the competitive dynamic in terms of pursuit of these hospital outreach deals or professional lab services types of engagements. What I would tell you is the funnel is as big as it’s ever been. We expect to close several deals here in the first half of the year, so still feel very good about that.  In terms of small regional labs that are out there, first I’d say there’s not that many left out there that are of significant size. Certainly those that participated in COVID testing, and now that that volume is declining, yes, we are seeing a few raise their hands and put up the retirement flag and potentially sell out, so we look at each and every one of them. If we think it adds to our competitive position in a certain geographic marketplace, we’ll look at it. If we don’t think we need it from a competitive standpoint, then we take a bye on those.
AJ Rice: Okay, thanks a lot.
Jim Davis: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Quest has a very long track record of finding cost efficiencies through Invigorate, so I’m curious how the SG&A cost cutting of $100 million compares to what Invigorate usually finds in SG&A, or most cost savings via Invigorate usually done and cost of services and fixed cost leverage on volume. 
Jim Davis: Yes, so first, the $100 million cost takeout is incremental to our Invigorate plan for 2023. With our Invigorate plan, we target roughly 3% of our entire cost base for the company, so call that $6.4 billion-ish, 3%, call it $180 million, $190 million a year. We actually got very close to that target in 2022. As we’ve said in the prepared remarks, it did not completely offset wage inflation and the slight price headwind that we did see, along with just other non-labor inflationary pressures. Now as we go into 2023, we’ve got a full funnel of productivity ideas, productivity initiatives that we’re driving through the company. I would say the other thing that we think will really help us in 2023 is simply the stabilization of our workforce. Attrition has a really major impact on your productivity when you’re constantly churning phlebotomists, logistics and specimen processing, so that has stabilized, it’s coming down. We feel good about it and we feel good about the overall productivity plan in terms of offsetting inflation, which we expect to be slightly softer, easier in 2023, and we expect price all-in across Quest Diagnostics to actually be a positive for 2023.
Sam Samad: At the risk of being redundant here, I’m still going to repeat something from what Jim said at the beginning, because it’s really important for all your assumptions. The productivity improvements and the Invigorate actions, which is the 3% that we expect to get, that’s in addition on top of the $100 million of SG&A reductions that we’ve already taken for the most part.
Pito Chickering: Got it, and sorry, two quick follow-ups. You talked about phlebotomists. Just curious where the phlebotomist hourly wage is today and if you think is the right level to compete against retail channels. The second one is the public lab supply companies have been talking about pricing for a while. Just curious as one of the largest labs in the U.S., what you assume for supply inflation for ’23, or can you offset that inflation simply by changing vendors and/or leveraging your scale?
Jim Davis: Yes, so our phlebotomy rates vary by region of the country. What I would tell you is our increase in wages for phlebotomy were certainly in line with the 3% to 4% wage impact that we saw last year. It’s what we’re planning for 2023, and as I indicated, our retention has improved. Our attrition has certainly stabilized and declined, so we feel good about that.
Pito Chickering: Then on the supply inflation, just curious--?
Jim Davis: Yes, I’m sorry, the supply inflation. Again, 70% of what we purchase each year is under contract. When those contracts come up, they generally represent an opportunity for deflation, meaning we’re going to run a competition between the vendors and we look for improvements from a cost, quality and turnaround time perspective. Where the inflation hit us in 2022 is really on some of the non-supplies, the reagents and things like that. Some of that could have been pre-analytical supplies, masks, gowns, things like that, as well as just the normal inflation that you all see in your businesses, which could be hotels, air travel and things like that. Now again, we think that’s softening here as we get into 2023, and we certainly put guardrails on travel and living expenses and things like that.
Pito Chickering: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Jim, just a quick question on rates from payors. I think in the past, you’ve expressed some optimism in seeing a little bit of rate improvement in the commercial side. But I think in your prepared remarks, you called out a little bit of reimbursement pressure at 60 basis points or so, so just curious how do we reconcile that, and maybe just broadly speaking what you’re seeing in terms of payor receptivity to increasing rates on the reimbursement front. Thanks. 
Jim Davis: Yes, I think we said in the prepared remarks that our pricing was down about 50 basis points, which actually represents the best that I’ve seen in my time with Quest Diagnostics, so we feel good about that. We’ve also said that as we renegotiate new contracts, and every one of these contracts is four to five years in length so you can expect that 20% to 25% will renew this year, which they will, and the preponderance of those contracts we’ve seen rate increases at a minimum rate--you know, holding rate flat to prior contracts, so we view that as a very positive. What we’ve also said is, look - we’ve got a $35 million to $40 million rate increase through Medicare draw fee increases, and today we get reimbursed on roughly 25% of the commercial draws that we do. We’re going to push hard not only to expand that 25% but those that do reimburse us to take those rates up as well, so we are pushing hard at every turn to increase prices across this business. The last thing I’d say is, look, there’s a portfolio of $700 million to $800 million of other businesses in Quest Diagnostics - that can be our Exam One business, our employer solutions business, our employee population health business, and we’ve pushed for 2% to 3% price increases on that portfolio of business and we’ve largely gotten those in place for 2023. Again, this is the most optimistic price outlook that we’ve put forward since I joined Quest in 2013.
Sam Samad: Yes, maybe just to put a couple of points of emphasis around it, in the prepared remarks we talked about a price impact in Q4 of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year of price headwind. As we look towards 2023, what’s reflected in our guidance right now is actually a positive price impact year-over-year, and obviously that’s benefited from the reimbursement of the specimen collection fee. It’s definitely a positive. We’ve managed to really make some good progress in terms of our pricing. 
Jim Davis: The other thing I want to mention is we’ve talked about these value-based contracts, and over 30% of our health plan contracts have some type of incentive for us to earn additional value, which we actually don’t put into the price equation, but it’s really good payor mix. These incentives could be based on share of spend with Quest Diagnostics, it could be based on leakage, it could be based on the movement of requisitions from high priced hospital labs into laboratories like Quest Diagnostics, so those value-based incentives are an important part of our business, and as we succeed in achieving that value for the health plans, there’s rewards that come back to us.
Shawn Bevec: Brian, this is Shawn. Just one last thing I wanted to add. Most of the price impact that we saw in 2022 was largely driven by some of the client bill, largely with the hospitals. The health plan book was actually pretty good, pretty stable, so.
Brian Tanquilut: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I’m really just trying to understand all these puts and takes a little bit. I guess my first one is, is the $100 million of SG&A, it’s incremental. Is that--you know, Invigorate typically offsets some other inflationary pressures, labor costs and the like. Is this $100 million incremental such that it drops to the bottom line, or are there other offsets there? Two, is there any change with the pricing benefit that you’re talking about, better pricing is certainly a tailwind, I would think for ’23, so how do we think about that in terms of--or is there an offset there on mix on the margin for, basically, your volume mix, something to that effect? I’m just trying to understand the puts and takes.
Jim Davis: Yes, again the $100 million, it is incremental to our Invigorate plan of record, and yes, it drops right to the bottom line. In terms of pricing, no, the improvement drops to the bottom line as well. We’re not suggesting any other offset at this point. Obviously we had strong [indiscernible] both in Q4 and for the year. That benefit, we would put in three buckets: test mix, which was very positive for the year; we saw a big surge of flu and RSV testing along with COVID, but flu and RSV that came in Q4, that has since moderated; and then our business mix was good in terms of payor mix. Then finally, year-over-year we made nice improvements in patient concessions, so our ability to collect, our ability to reduce denials and get paid for the work we do was certainly a positive tailwind for us in 2022.
Kevin Caliendo: And if I can just ask one quick follow-up, should we assume in our models the billion dollar buyback gets used in 2023?
Sam Samad: No, Kevin. The billion dollar share authorization increase, that’s in addition to the $311 million that we currently have on the previous authorization, but you should not expect that that is what’s assumed in the guidance. What we’ve assumed, actually, is that any share buybacks we do are to offset equity dilution, so essentially the share count is roughly flat with where we are at the end of the year, so don’t assume the $1 billion to be built into the projections.
Kevin Caliendo: Very helpful, thank you guys.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Brackmann: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  Maybe as it relates specifically to COVID test reimbursement with the PHE ending, maybe just give us a little more detail on how those conversations with commercial payors are trending and how we should be thinking about expectations there. Then I guess just related to that, how are you thinking about any permanent changes to your respiratory testing portfolio broadly, now that we’ve lived through three years of COVID? Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, so again, CMS--and we’ve had direct discussions with them, it’s very clear that once the public health emergency ends, the rate will go to $51. We are certainly expecting and driving those discussions with commercial payors that we expect that rate to be $51 as well. It’s a new test that should be treated as such. Some may have a slightly different opinion on that, Andrew, so that’s where we negotiate. In addition to that, there’s coverage policy decisions that all need to be worked out as well, asymptomatic versus symptomatic testing, so we’re bullish that the country needs these tests, commercial payors need these tests, and we’re going to drive these discussions in the most favorable way that we can. In terms of respiratory panels, obviously with COVID still out there, it’s not going to go away in 2023. When patients presented in the fall, winter and here in January with respiratory symptoms, some physicians ordered three tests, some physicians ordered one and then re-flexed to others, depending on if the first one turned out to be negative, so there were a variety of patterns that were out there. But you know, we don’t expect COVID to go away in 2023, so whether RSV and flu tick up like they did in 2022 remains to be seen, and so we’ll just have to see how it plays out in the late fall, early winter.
Operator: The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. One quick housekeeping question and then a follow-up. The housekeeping question, just expectations for net interest expense for the year, and then how should we think--and also then, how should we think about the M&A contribution that’s embedded in your revenue and your volume growth in the ’23 guide, and should we still think about that 2% bogey at the way to look at it for going forward on the revenue contribution? Thanks.
Sam Samad: Yes, so I’ll handle the questions, but I missed the part on the expense. What type of expense?
Derik de Bruin: I’m sorry - net interest expense.
Sam Samad: Oh, net interest expense - okay. That’s roughly flat, I’d say year-over-year in terms of ‘222 to ’23, Derik, is the assumption to take there.  In terms of M&A, what we have assumed in our guide for 2023 is really no material prospective M&A, so essentially what’s closed already, what was included in ’23 in terms of deals that have been made - any outreach, for instance, hospital deals that have already closed in ’22, those you’ll see a benefit from in ’23, but there is no prospective M&A included. When you think about our long term target that we had talked about, around 2% contribution from M&A, we have not assumed any prospective M&A in ’23 on top of our base revenue growth.
Derik de Bruin: All right, so with completed M&A, then what’s the contribution for ’23?
Sam Samad: It’s not significant. We’re not going to give the exact contribution, but it’s really not that material in terms of what we have this year that carries into next year.
Shawn Bevec: Derik, we had one month of Pac Health, because that’s what closed last year at the end of January, and then the Suma Health and the Northern Light outreach acquisitions, those were pretty small.
Derik de Bruin: Great, thank you.
Operator: The last question in the queue is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question about advanced diagnostics and your assumptions for ’23, including contribution and then more specifically on the positive impact in pricing, and any kind of incremental investments that you think specifically for 2023 will be necessary to sustain that growth, accelerate it.
Jim Davis: Yes, so we’ve talked about our investments in really three categories. First, consumer initiated testing, which we covered, that business will continue to grow on the base side of our testing in 2023, and as we’ve indicated, it will certainly be less dilutive than it was in 2022.  The second big area of investments has been in oncology and what we call genomic sequencing services, and really building out what we call our integrated genomics platform. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we brought up a new LDT in Q4 using the Illumina platform - it’s referred to as the TSO 500, but it is a Quest LDT, and it’s really important in therapy selection decisions for cancer. We’re really happy about that. We brought it up at our SJC facility and we’ll be expanding that to a second facility here in early 2023, so we certainly expect that business to grow.  On this integrated genomics platform, look - the world has moved from micro array testing to whole exome to whole transcriptome, and now moving quickly to whole genome testing, and we expect with this platform to have a really good sample to complete information platform, low cost, high throughput, really good turnaround time, and we’ll update you more about that at our upcoming investor day. The final thing is--you know, we referred to it as pharma services, which grew over 15% last year, and this is us participating in companion diagnostics. We participate in phase 1 clinical trials, either from a pharma company or from a CRO, and then we do a lot of testing and validation work for our IVD partners in the industry, and that business continues to grow as well.  The last thing I’d say is, look, we felt really good about our growth in prenatal testing this year and other rare genetic disorders, so it’s a business that continues to grow in the high single, low double digits for Quest Diagnostics.
Operator: There is one more question that popped in the queue from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Thanks guys for taking the question. First up, we’ve previously talked about some of the uneven recoveries by geography. Last quarter, you noted that New York City was still not fully recovered, so can you just give us the latest update on the recovery there in New York? Then my follow-up is just on the analyst day this March, can you walk us through some of the topics that you plan on hitting on, any expectations for that? Thanks.
Sam Samad: Yes, thank you, Rachel, for the question - this is Sam. In terms of the geography, I think it’s consistent with what we said before, and let me repeat what we said because we haven’t seen really a major change in the dynamic yet. We are back to pre-pandemic levels and above across most geographies, the notable exception being the east, where New York City, I think we’ve seen roughly 3% to 5% outflow from the city in terms of population, 3% to 5% of the population leaving the city. We haven’t seen that fully come back yet, even though the city is much more vibrant and there’s more activity. But I don’t think in terms of people coming back and getting health care in New York City, I don’t think it’s back to where it was pre-pandemic by any means. The other thing we look at is ridership on public transportation as an indicator, as a key metric to see how is that also coming back, and it’s still about 35% or so below pre-pandemic levels in terms of ridership, based on the last data points that we got. The punch line here being that the east is still lagging, but everywhere else is above pre-pandemic levels in terms of utilization. 
Jim Davis: Yes, and then Rachel, thanks for the question on investor day. I think there’s really four broad topics that we’re going to talk about. First around growth, we’ll go deep on what we’re doing from an oncology and genomic sequencing standpoint. We’ll give you a lot more color on our consumer initiated testing business, the progress we’re making and why we continue to be excited about that, and then we’ll also address the core part of this business, which is serving physicians, serving health systems, and what we’re doing to continue to drive growth in those segments. Finally and as always, we’ll address what we’re doing to improve the customer experience and drive productivity in this business. It’s a never-ending part of what we do and we continue to drive productivity, and we’ll give you our plans for ’23 and beyond. Finally, just as a reminder, it is March 16, it will be at the New York Stock Exchange, and we’ll obviously provide our long term outlook as part of that session.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions in the queue. 
Jim Davis: Okay, so I wanted to thank everybody for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing you all on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange, and have a great afternoon. Thanks everyone.
Sam Samad: Thank you everybody.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now Iâd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. Iâm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and then we will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnosticsâ future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the companyâs knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. While we had a strong third quarter, we drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and we delivered strong earnings despite inflationary pressures and investments in growth areas. Based on our performance, we have raised our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition, adding management depth and expertise to help us grow in important areas. As you know, Jim will assume the responsibilities of CEO and President on November 1, and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Before I turn it over to Jim, Iâd like to say a few words about savings access to Laboratory Services Act Salsa. If enacted Salsa would fix PAMA and put the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule back on a sustainable path. Based on the efforts of our trade Association, support for Salsa has broadened and continues to strengthen. As you know, we are currently planning for a Medicare fee schedule reduction under PAMA of $80 million to $90 million in 2023 if Congress does not intervene again this year. However, the work we are doing is aimed at reducing or postponing that burden and unfortunately, Congress has already acted three times to stop further cuts from going into place. It is therefore very important that we continue to build support for the enactment of Salsa when Congress returns to Washington after the election. As I transition to the Executive Chairman, will remain actively engaged on this issue, working with ACLA and other stakeholders. Now Iâd like to turn it over to Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Steve. On behalf of our 50,000 Quest colleagues, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years. You turned around a company that was struggling and build shareholder value and transformed Quest into a trusted healthcare partner with a strong foundation for future growth. Iâm personally grateful for all the help and guidance and friendship that you shared during the transition. Thanks, Steve. Turning to our results. Our base business grew year-over-year in the third quarter with performance rebounding in August and September from the softer volume trends that we saw earlier in the year. In fact, before Hurricane Ian hit in September, we were seeing some of the highest base testing volumes we have ever experienced. Iâd like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts to restore our labs and PSCs for our patients and customers in the wake of Hurricane Ian while also enduring personal loss of their homes and belongings. Iâm also grateful to our employees outside of the impacted areas, who stepped up to provide financial support to our colleagues in need. As many of you are aware of Florida is an important state for us. During the quarter, we grew the base business revenues and continue to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer initiated testing. To help offset inflationary pressures we have continued to pursue our operational excellence strategy and have been closely managing our cost structure through our invigorate initiatives. In the third quarter, total revenues were 2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $2.17 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $502 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were 316 million in the third quarter down 55% from 2021 and down 11% from the previous quarter. After plateauing in June and July, our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to average 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. M&A continues to be a driver of growth. We recently announced an outreach lab purchase from Summa Health, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Ohio. While this is a small acquisition, itâs a positive indicator. We are seeing that hospital systems are more open to discussions and before the pandemic. Many large and small health systems face substantial financial and labor pressures that make our range of services very attractive. Weâre pleased with the activity in our M&A pipeline and hope to share additional news with you later this year. We also announced a professional lab services relationship with Lee Health, Southwest Floridaâs primary community owned health system to provide supply chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee health and selected outpatient centers. We will also continue to perform reference testing for Lee Health. Our implementation plans have been slightly delayed by Hurricane Ian, though we expect this relationship will have a positive impact on revenue growth in 2023.  Turning now to health plans. Both volumes and revenues continue to grow faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Value based care relationships continue to gain traction. Not only does this yield benefit for health plans in their members, but also it enables us to gain share. Weâve begun to renew some of our value based contracts with national health plans while continuing to engage and expand our value based footprint with other plans. Value based relationships are appealing to health plans because it helps them reduce the overall cost of care, provides insights to better health outcomes and provides an exceptional value to members. Weâre on track to meet our goal of realizing 50% of our health plan revenues from value based relationships by the end of next year. Also, as we continue to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements, we see increased volumes and pricing from these contracts. Weâre seeing a more favorable pricing environment. And over the last two years the majority of our renewals have included stable to positive reimbursement. In advanced diagnostics we saw growth from prenatal genetics and genomic sequencing services in the third quarter. We continued to make investments to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. Just last week, we announced the addition of Mark Gardner, our Senior Vice President of molecular genomics and oncology. In this new position Mark, an established leader in molecular genomics next generation sequencing and oncology diagnostics, is responsible for driving growth and expanding our offerings in these areas. The investments weâre making in consumer initiated testing enabled us to recently launch a new e-commerce platform. The new site is more powerful and consumer friendly with a compelling user experience and a number of enhancements. Weâre encouraged by the early success of the site in the first few weeks of its launch, and we expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter ending in 2023 toward our goal of $250 million of annual consumer initiated testing revenues by 2025. We also launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of our consumer initiated testing offerings which cover everything from womenâs health tests to allergy testing, and sexually transmitted infections. Check out the new site at Questhealth.com and look for the new ads. The second part of our two points strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains and improving the customer experience. Here are a few examples. As COVID-19 volumes have declined, weâve begun to repurpose some of our COVID-19 testing platforms to enhance our quality and reduce costs. Today, 75% of our patients are arriving at PSC with an appointment compared to less than 25% just three years ago. This increased number of appointments allows us to flex our workforce to meet demand within a particular geography, which enables us to serve our patients faster. For patients who walk into a patient service center our new schedule a check in program sets expectations in the waiting room and balances the load for our phlebotomist. Walk-ins now self register when they arrive and learn how long theyâll need to wait. Our average wait time is approximately five minutes, which is roughly half the level since 2019. Finally, we continue to drive the use of automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity gains to help offset inflationary pressures. Now Iâll turn it over to Sam who will provide more details on a performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022.
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.5 billion down 10.4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 5.1% to $2.17 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 55% to $316 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 10.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by solid growth in our base testing revenue despite the impact of Hurricane Ian at the end of the quarter. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 6.2% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis points to the total volume. Total and organic base testing volumes increased 1.6% and 1.4% respectively versus the prior year. The performance of our base business strengthened beginning in late July as COVID-19 cases and the positivity rates declined throughout August and September. The impact of Hurricane Ian represented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points to volume growth in the quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the third quarter. We resulted approximately 3.1 million molecular tests down approximately 4 million tests and 0.4 million tests versus the prior year and second quarter respectively. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have averaged roughly 17,000 tests per day so far in October. Revenue for requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with our expectations with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $392 million or 15.8% of revenues compared to $652 million or 23.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $423 million or 17% of revenues compared to $694 million or 25% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline and adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume and investments to accelerate growth in our base business. We were also impacted by a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional retail channels, which carry additional expenses. Reported EPS was $2.17 in the quarter compared to $4.02 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.96 last year. The impact of Hurricane Ian reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the third quarter. Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $1.38 billion in 2022, versus $1.75 billion in the prior year period. Turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.72 billion and $9.86 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.38 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.41 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.52 to $8.72 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. And when you think about our updated guidance, please consider the following. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We also believe this is a reasonable assumption for run rate COVID-19 molecular testing volumes heading into 2023. Last week, the public health emergency was extended another 90 days through mid January. We therefore assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the end of this year. We expect reimbursements to decline when the PHG expires, which we currently assume will happen in January. Given the timing of hurricane Ian the impact on our business has continued in the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we are making investments this year to accelerate growth. We spent approximately $110 million through the third quarter and we expect to invest more than $50 million in the fourth quarter primarily to support marketing and promotion of our new consumer initiated testing platform. Finally, before getting to your questions, I wanted to say a few words about 2023. I know thereâs a lot of focus on EPS expectations for 2023. As you might expect, we arenât prepared to provide detailed 2023 guidance today. There are obviously a number of assumptions and dynamics to consider but I see nothing that would prevent us from meeting current consensus estimates for next year within a reasonable range of outcomes. We will continue to review our plans and assumptions and provide our full 2023 guidance in early February. I will now turn it back to Steve. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Sam. Well to summarize, we accelerated growth in the base business year-over-year. We grew our base business revenue while continue to make investments which position us well for the future. And we have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022.As Jim mentioned earlier, this will be my last earnings call as CEO and President and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Iâd like to thank all of you on this call for your interest in the company. Iâve enjoyed our many conversations over the last 10 years and I thank you for your time and commitment to understand our business. Finally, to the 50,000 Colleagues of Quest Diagnostics, itâs been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your CEO. Together, we have empowered better health with our insights, grown the business and provide a critical testing capacity through one of the most challenging healthcare crisis in our history. I will always be grateful what youâve done to serve our customers. Thank you. Now weâd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions.  The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann if youâre there, please check your mute button.
Ann Hynes: Okay. Sorry about that. Okay, Steve, I just want to say congratulate -- and it has been a pleasure working with you all these years.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Ann.
Ann Hynes: So my first question thanks for the color on 2023. Obviously, it was on top of investor minds, but just for modeling purposes. Do you just maybe tell us what has changed directionally on the positive side and the negative side since you first provided that in 2019 and maybe within that the DTC program. I know itâs a headwind to earnings this year. Do we expect you to become profitable in 2003? And maybe talk about the profitability profile in 2024? That would be great. Thanks.
Jim Davis: Yes, thanks and good morning. So let me start and Iâll have Sam fill in some color here. So but thereâs a lot of changes since 2019. And Iâll just talk about a few tailwinds and headwinds. from a tailwind standpoint reimbursement has never been better. We were down approximately 50 basis points year-to-date. Thatâs a much better environment without PAMA in 2019 was where we were historically losing over 100 basis points. And then PAMA was on top of that. So we feel much better about price going into 2023. Our base volumes are back above 2019 levels. In fact, it points during the quarter. In September, we exceeded the high point February, January of 2020. So feel good about that. You mentioned investments in CIT. Yes, thatâll be a tailwind going into 2023. We feel good about that. And then as you know, weâve made investments in the business, investing in our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and we expect to get above normal growth rates out of that side of our portfolio. Now weâre dealing with some headwinds, as well as you know. Weâve built into our plan, a third round of PAMA cuts $80 million to $90 million next year COVID, which we didnât obviously have in 2019. We expect going into next year there. Early part of next year, weâll be at the 10 to 15 point. And we have some inflation that we certainly didnât see in 2019 thatâs running through our business. We estimated $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter and we expect that inflation to continue into the early part of next year. Sam, any other caller?
Sam Samad: Yes, I think youâve captured it. Well, Jim. I mean, again, weâre, going to give guidance in February, we wanted to just capture some of these maybe changed assumptions, or at least varying assumptions. But listen, thereâs nothing that Iâve seen so far that weâve seen so far, that prevents us from meeting the current consensus estimates again, within a reasonable range of outcomes. In terms of share repurchases, we have made share repurchases this year 950 million throughout the first three quarters of the year, and thatâll provide a lift as well, in terms of earnings next year.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes let me just make another comment about some of the investments weâve made, because I think thereâs a little bit of a misunderstanding about that adding to our cost, and not helping us as we get into â23 and â24. And Ann you alluded to that. So weâve mentioned that, this year, weâll be investing about 160 million. And as you recall, in 2021, we started the investments. We took some of the proceeds from COVID and made roughly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of investments in two businesses. One advanced diagnostics and as Jim said, we probably four we have already started to see have faster growth rates because of those investments. And the second is our consumer initiated testing. And we will only make investments as you would expect if we expect to get a return. And so what youâre going to see in 2023, is particularly around CIT are starting to get a return for that investment for CIT. And even though we donât report the financials, youâll see less of a drain on our earnings in 2023 because of the growth rate we will get from CIT and that will be a tailwind for â23. And you asked about 2024, weâre not going to give exact details, because we will throttle that investment at that a good part of the how fast the market grows, and where we have some capacity to accelerate growth. And so weâll hold back on give you an exact number about profitability, but we are going to get to return from that $250 million. And let me just close by saying that $250 million, some of it is permanent, because weâre building these two businesses, advanced diagnostics, and CIT but some of it was temporal. And so when you think about modeling for through 23, and you look at what you might expect for expenses from us for 2022. And these are total expenses R&D and SG&A what we have modeled and working on is actually expenses in â23 coming down versus 2022. So thatâs a change because some of these investments were temporal. So Iâll just leave it there. Thank you.
Ann Hynes: Thanks. 
Operator: Next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open. 
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks, actually want to expand on Steveâs comment right there because thinking through this, thinking through the guidance and getting to the numbers, versus sort of what the run rate is coming out, there has to be a pretty meaningful amount of expenses coming out. So of the 160, should we be thinking about that, as is like, half of that goes away to get to sort of, including PAMA weâre talking $80 million to $100 million of expenses that would need to come down unless you think volumes are really accelerate and the incremental margins on us. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on the expense side? And how to think about modeling that? Is it just like percentage of that 160 that comes out? 
Sam Samad: Yes. So Kevin, as you think about next year, I mean, yes, we are taking expenses down. So thereâs going to be some reductions as we look at expenses given the macro environment that we are in. I would not assume right now, strategic investments necessarily coming down. Thatâs not an assumption that I would make. And we also have our invigorate program where we expect up productivity in the business and thatâs an ongoing program that we do, that we have every year. But we are in a way reinvigorating and invigorate to have further productivity from the business. So I think as you look at margins, you have to consider those things. We have maybe a consistent inflationary environment is the assumption wages increasing by salaries, wages and benefits increasing by 3% to 4%. But we are taking expenses down next year and other areas. And we are focusing on invigorator.
Kevin Caliendo: Maybe I can ask it a little bit different way. Your base margins. I know you donât think about base margins versus COVID margins. But we all try to model it that way. If we were to think about it, would you then think that base margins could look or be better than what they were in a pre-COVID setting?
Steve Rusckowski: So thatâs we should talk about kind of the assumptions that we have right now for 2022. Weâre not going to comment right now on base margins versus total COVID margins. But I think the way to think about it is the pricing environment is improving. So we are seeing a less of an impact in terms of price reductions. Thereâs the PAMA impact for next year. But weâre seeing historically low pricing pressure on our business, which as we said in the quarter was 60 basis points. So thatâs an improvement. I talked about some of the cost reductions that weâre going to make. And I talked about the invigorate productivity savings that weâre going to make. So we are going to definitely see some productivity improvements in the business but I wonât give a specific base margin number there.
Kevin Caliendo: I tried. Thanks so much, guys. Thatâs really helpful. 
Operator: Next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. 
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about utilization. So there was a lot of worry heading into the quarter because of -- your base growth actually accelerated to 5%. So I am just curious what you think is going on here driving the relative out-performance versus what it looks like the market might be doing?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So thank Jack. As we mentioned in the opening comments, our volumes improved every month through the third quarter. So July was weak, August was better. And September, even with the hurricane impact was obviously much better than the average that we reported. In addition we reported 5.1% revenue growth in the quarter on the bass business. And a chunk of that did come from revenue per rack. Despite a 50 basis point headwind on price, our clinical mix and business mix improved in the quarter, which contributed to that strong base performance. And so we were happy with the utilization levels. Physician offices appeared to be strong and even our health system segment, which is a combination of our reference testing in PLS was also strong in the quarter.
Jack Meehan: Maybe just trying to dig in a little bit more. I think everyoneâs trying to understand the market growth and share dynamics, are you, whatâs your dialogue, like with hospitals now around either outreach sales or more kind of reference work getting sent out? Or have you heard more about labor being an issue? Just any thoughts on that would be great.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, Jack. So I can tell you that our opportunities with health systems has never been stronger on multiple fronts. Now in the quarter, we announced the Summa health outreach acquisition. Summa as the health system in Akron, Ohio. We announced a PLS new PLS relationship with Lee Health in Florida. And the funnel of opportunities continues to grow. Thereâs not a day that goes by that we donât read in one of the journals about health systems reporting, margin pressures and exacerbated by some of the pressures they have with wages, particularly on the nursing side. So itâs a very opportunistic us to go into health systems and explain to them how we can help them reduce their lifespan by upwards of 10% to 15% to 18%. And so, or monetize their outreach book of business to provide some cash infusion to them. So itâs an opportunistic time for us.
Operator: Next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Erin Wright: Hi, could you give us an update on your relationships in negotiations with the commercial payers and offsets in terms of pricing dynamics there? And where are we at in terms of those preferred relationships helping to steer volume? And do initiatives such as United laboratory benefit management that was more recent, does that have any impact on your business at all? I believe itâs targeting some over testing on the esoteric side. Thanks. 
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So thank you, Aaron. So our relationships with commercial payers, if you want to measure the output of the relationship, again, weâll turn to the pricing environment. Itâs never been better. We are only down 50 basis points in the quarter and you go back to 2018, 2019, we were losing 100 basis points. Weâve also said that the majority of the negotiations weâve had with payers over the last two years have resulted in either flat to positive price increases and so we consider that a victory. Weâve also said that the number of value based relationships that weâre entering into meaning that thereâs opportunities for us to create value for them and earn value back for us by working very closely with the likes of United Healthcare and we work together as teams and we target physicians that are using out of network labs. We target physicians that are using health, expensive health system labs, and collectively our teams work this day in and day out and yes, weâve been able to move Rex from high price institutions to better quality lower price labs like Quest Diagnostics.
Jim Davis: Yes to comments on Jackâs question and Erin first of all, or plan is to gain share. And so one element of gain share is that relationships without plans and we do believe weâre making progress to that progress will continue as we pick up more she are particularly with the Nationals. Just want to make sure we remind you that 50 basis points is not exclusive to commercial payer pricing, but all pricing. So commercial payer pricings within it and that is improved to Jimâs comment vastly versus where we were. But we have price pressure with client relationships, with physicians we have price concessions with hospital reference work. So thereâs other price concessions in that number. But on the commercial payer side, itâs less than 50 basis points that much improved of where it was years ago.
Operator: Next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So as I think about just the core testing, obviously COVID is declining here. How should you be thinking about your outlook here for 2023 especially given the economic backdrop that weâre seeing and the broader inflation trends that weâre seeing? And how thatâs impacting the consumer, essentially, the patient?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So thanks, Brian, for the question. The way I would think about it is again, COVID, continues to come down. Although we may be at an inflection point here on COVID. Too early to tell, but obviously, these two new variants, the BQ1 and BQ 1.1 are growing in terms of concern, itâs now 11%, 12%, of all new cases, higher in the east, reported to be over 20% in the New York City area. But as of now, weâre thinking 10,000 to 15,000 a day, as we go into next year. We reported that our base business, the volumes recovered, as we move through the third quarter, we expect that trend to continue. And but remember, physicians are only part of it. Again, we feel great about opportunities to help our health system partners whether itâs additional reference testing, or PLS and then we feel great about our acquisition funnel and weâre looking at several outreach opportunities. We announced one that closed but stay tuned. There should be some more announcements as we get into the early part of next year.
Jim Davis: Just to remind you all that there is a correlation between COVID volumes that are based business. And so as COVID improves, we believe that could help our base business. And weâve clearly started to see that in Q3 and to some extent, as weâve talked before, we have somewhat of a natural hedge, because of COVID goes up and base softens. We have seen that in the past. And therefore the improving COVID situation should be a tailwind on base growth going forward. And as we said before, most of our major markets have recovered, we still have not seen full recovery in New York City. And we still believe that theyâll gradually step by step improve over the next couple of years. And weâll go back to where we were in 2019. So thatâs the only major metropolitan area that we havenât seen full recovery. So from an overall perspective, the COVID direction should be favorable to base.
Operator: Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
A.J. Rice: Looking to working together. Maybe just to talk a little bit about capital deployment. Youâre talking about obviously, you did a lot on the share repurchase here today, as you mentioned. So that continues to be part of the store. Youâve got these hospital opportunities. There are other M&A potentially talking deals out there. And then some of the investments consumer direct and so forth. Does that, how do you see capital priorities and capital deployment as we exited this year and think about the next year or two?
Sam Samad: Yes, thanks, A.J. for the question. This is Sam. So as you think about our position, right now weâve generated 1.38 billion of operating cash flow through three quarters of the year. Weâre sitting on a very healthy amount of cash of 700 million. When you think about our capital deployment philosophy, itâs very consistent. We said that weâre going to return the majority of our free cash flow back to shareholders. And weâre going to focus on making sure that obviously, we invest in the business thatâs, we talked about the strategic investments. This year, we expect to make 160 million of strategic we have net of the 400 million of capital, whatever free cash flow that we have, weâre going to return back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in the form of share repurchases and M&A. Now, to the extent that I think we have a robust pipeline of M&A transactions and opportunities, as Jim mentioned, to the extent that we, we are going to be very disciplined about M&A though, I mean, to the extent that we donât have a creative deals that we believe really add strategic value to us and produce the meet the ROIC threshold that we have in our accretive then weâre going to return back that cash in terms of share repurchases.
Operator: Next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. 
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. And Steve, thanks for all your help, over the years different questions for the fourth quarter guidance of $1.91 analyzes to 764. And as the good guys, the improved base pricing business as well as strong COVID pricing. So if we put of PAMA in that one, that would be the launch pad in 2023. Is 713, which seems like a pretty big gap versus 850 consensus numbers. So can you give us some more color on how to bridge the gap between 713 and 850 between revenue growth and cost cutting? 
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Thanks, Pete. Let me start and then Iâll have Sam, pipe in here. So first our long term guidance on the growth rate of the company remains. We expect to grow our top line on the base business 4% to 5%. And we expect to get nice margin accretion off of that 4% to 5%. So we still feel good about that 4% to 5%. Next year, obviously, weâve said to percentage, roughly two percentage points of that can come from acquisition. Weâve said weâve got a great list, a good funnel of both tuck ins from outreach, as well as a few what I would call deals that enhance our capabilities, fill in some gaps in our portfolio. So feel good about that. We also feel good about our invigorate program and continuing to work that, as Sam said, reinvigorating our invigorate program to offset some of the margin pressures that weâve seen from inflation. So we feel good about. We feel good about the investments that weâre making in ADX and weâve said that, consumer initiated testing next year should be a tailwind to us. And then finally as Sam and Steve said, we are fine tuning the cost structure, and weâll make the necessary rebalances in the cost structure to deliver what we need to deliver next year. So we feel good about that.
Jim Davis: Yes maybe Iâll add a couple of comments to Jimâs. So just weâre not going to give you obviously guidance right now, but just maybe directionally give you some things also to build into, or to think about as you build your model for next year. Expense reductions is an important one, Jim mentioned that. The fact that CIT investments will drive growth in that consumer segment. And so they will be less dilutive, as you look at next year versus this year. The fact that when you think about pricing itâs a definitely improving environment for us as weâve said, 50 basis points in Q3. So thatâs an additional number that maybe some of you use the 1% pricing negative pricing impact is no longer the case in terms of what weâre seeing, because of all the things that we talked about around value based contracts with the health plans. And then when you think about COVID I mean, COVID is obviously the assumption going into 2023 is that itâs 10,000 to 15,000. Thereâs variability around that. But thatâs our assumption right now. And the 10,000 to 15,000 is so itâs coming down. COVID testing is coming down, thereâs an improvement in the base business as a result of that. But also the fact that with the PHE ending, at least our assumption is that it ends in January, even though that average reimburse price comes down, thatâs not a straight impact the margin because we have cost that we incur in the non traditional retail channels right now that will no longer, that we will no longer incur after the end of the PHE emergency. So you can also take you know, the margin on COVID as being completely impacted by that price reimbursed or by that reimbursement decrease.
Steve Rusckowski: Pito remember that our base business is growing in â23. Guys when you say think about modeling it off the fourth quarter remember the base will grow. Okay. And then secondly, just to underscore Jimâs comments is this company and weâll continue under Jimâs and Samâs leadership has a long track record of productivity improvements. And so Jim, in his prepared remarks talked about our operational excellence program. We have a specific program called Invigorate. And that Invigorate program is to drive 3% productivity. So when you think about 2023, and you think about potentially getting a PAMA cut you need to think about the expense reduction, base growth, as well as Invigorate offsetting some of the inflationary pressure, as well as potentially. And I can tell you weâve highlighted this before, in our investor presentations, thereâs a lot more room for us to drive productivity, particularly around automation, and digitalization going forward, and Jim will be driving that as he leaves the company.
Operator: Next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open. 
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Maybe one, on a similar vein, at least on the cost side, just in terms of some of the labor retention, labor inflation that you guys have seen us talk about against where we are in that process? And then secondarily, kind of on the back of that the supply chain as well, I know, itâs been a bit of a kind of issues pop up and you guys handle them well. Has that plateaued getting better? Maybe just a little bit of color, that would be helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so thanks, Patrick. So first, on the labor inflation. So what weâre seeing this year is between 3% and 4%, and our plan next year is to have a merit increase of roughly 3%, across the company. But we would expect to have to make some other equity adjustments along the way. So I think from a planning modeling standpoint, that 3% to 4% range still feels good from a labor utilization. But Iâll tell you on our employee retention and attrition is that it has stabilized here in the third quarter, albeit, itâs stabilized at a higher level than we would like, which obviously affects productivity. So we continue to work really hard on making classes the employer of choice, and itâs not just about wages, thereâs a lot of other things, as you can imagine that go into that. In terms of inflation on the supplies and materials front we purchase north of $2 billion worth of what we call pre analytical and analytical supplies. And on that roughly $2 billion, about 80% of it is locked up in terms of itâs under contract. And most of those contracts that weâve entered into in previous years, actually do not contain price indexes or price going up. If anything through the contract period, sometimes prices improve. So, we feel good about that, but 20% of roughly 2 billion is a big number that is not completely locked up. And thatâs where we do see some inflationary pressures. In addition to the pre-analytical and analytical supplies we have a lot of, we have roughly $88 million, $900 million of other spend, that is logistics, professional services, janitorial services. Travel living expenses. So, all of that is really not under contract. And thatâs where we see the majority of inflation in our business today. We will it get better next year, will it get worse next year. Hard to predict. But everything that the Fed is doing, will hopefully slow those inflationary pressures that we are seeing. But again weâre committed, and we work real hard for our Invigorate program to offset as much of this as we possibly can.
Operator: Next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning, Steve. Thanks for all your time and patience with me, appreciate it over the years. I guess a couple of questions. A lot of might have been answered already. But are you expecting any sort of relief from youâd expect to solve for the past and sort of like your update in PAMA and then the follow up on that, or another one you know, as we sort of head into a recession and inflation picks up, I mean, are you seeing any increase in debt from your customers. Any concerns on people opting not to pay bills as theyâre sort of struggling right now. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: So letâs start with the Salsa PAMA comment. So as we said, for many years now, you should plan on PAMA caught in 2023. Thatâs what we assumed. And until we have news thatâs better than that, we should assume that. Number two is, in my prepared remarks to talk about the effort on Salsa. What Iâll add to those comment is the support congressional support. And this is on both sides of the aisle. And both in the House and in the Senate is very strong. So there is alignment that we need to have a permanent fix to the implementation of PAMA. But as you can imagine Washington is busy. There is a lot of topics on the table. And weâre trying to find a vehicle that we can attach it to. And I would expect, if we were successful with Salsa, itâll be late in this year, that will know that. And also, itâs going to cost money. So weâre in the process of getting a score from CBO. And there needs to be a pay for so weâre working through that. But I can tell you the alignment and the support of my colleagues throughout this industry has never been stronger. And weâve going doing grassroots efforts to send letters into Washington. So really a full court press to get set Salsa over the goal line. Now, if we donât, or if weâre not successful with Salsa the question is, can we get another year of relief. Weâve got that in the past. Again, Iâm not going to indicate that weâre going to get that again. But if we donât get Salsa there, obviously will be a pivot to ask for another year of relief. Weâll push on that. But again, weâre not planning that during our 2023 planning. 
Jim Davis: Yes. This is very good question on are we seeing an uptick in patient concession rate or patients unless -- no we are not seeing any impact as of yet on that. In fact, our patient concessions have actually improved rate and has actually improved year-over-year and weâre going to build into next year. We do a lot of things to work this and we work real hard. We have what we call real time adjudication. So, patient comes into our PSE, we take the requisition and we can literally adjudicate that claim x-the payment coming to us. So we know real time what tests on that requisition are going to be approved or denied, and we know what the patient balance is. And then we provide multiple ways for that patient to pay the bill or give us a form of payment so that when the claim is adjudicated, we know how to charge the patient. Weâre working on things to actually move that whole process upstream. So when the patient makes an appointment, and that requisition is already been delivered to us, because physician has sent it to us electronically, we can do that pre-adjudication, if you will, as the patient is making an appointment online. So even before they come into the PSC we can pre-adjudicate that claim. Weâre going to build the capability to do that. And so it improves our PSE productivity as well as gives the patient knowledge of what theyâre going to be billed before they walk into the PSE. So lots of things weâre doing to make it easier to pay to inform the patient. And all of those things help our patient concession rate.
Operator: And the last question in the queue is from . Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. Iâm going to come back to a topic thatâs been hit a few times but maybe ask a different way. The base revenue per requisition very, very strong here. I know weâve heard a lot of comments on pricing improving or really being less bad down 50 bibs, which would I think imply that your mix component and other components must have been something more like 4% growth on a per test basis. So Iâm curious if you can quantify for us or give us some qualitative color on what type of mix improvements you saw? What categories of testing, were you seeing the number of tests per requisition go up this quarter more than normal? Was there a changing impact from PLS volumes and the numbers this quarter? Or were there some nuances with value based contracts that maybe arenât fully understood by the street that could have been driving some of this upside mixed driven revenue? I know Iâm throwing a lot at you, but it feels like that was a pretty big number. So want to dig into it.
Jim Davis: Yes. So. Thanks Eric. So as you know, thereâs a lot of things that go into the calculation. So letâs take price per test out, because we already said that was down about 50 basis points. So your math is directionally correct. All of the things that were up about 3.8% in the quarter. there is really three very different types of mix that enter into that. There is clinical mix, business mix and payer mix. And from let me just start with clinical mix. Iâll just tell you that the investments weâre making in advanced diagnostics are paying off. Weâre getting a higher mix of molecular and other genetic and advanced based tasks. Hematology was good. Caner testing really good in the quarter. From a business mix standpoint thereâs a lot of things there. First, from a commercial payer standpoint, thereâs a mix of cap and fee for service, and weâll just tell you in the quarter fee per service was better and cap was lost. And if cap was less than, obviously, you got to fix payments. So that certainly helped us. Our health systems business was actually just a pure reference was good in the quarter and that tends to mix up our rep per and then finally thereâs payer mix issues. What portion is coming from commercial? What portion is coming from Medicare? What portion is coming from Medicaid? And that was favorable in the quarter. And then finally, CIT, our consumer initiated testing business has a higher revenue per rack. The pricing is better in that market, and weâre getting some left from our CIT business. So a lot of factors go into it. But thatâs kind of the summary of it.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay, I think that was the last question. I again, thank you for your support over the years, we added up the math and this is my 42nd call. Itâs been a pleasure working with all of you. Thank you for all your support. And Iâm sure youâre going to be seeing me around in our travels. So thank you and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; Mark Guinan, Chief Financial Officer; and Sam Samad, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will provide non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government, client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We performed well in the quarter, growing our base business year-over-year while increasing our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since March. As we have said before, we believe demand for COVID-19 molecular testing is not going away anytime soon. It will continue into 2023. Based on our overall performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022, we have raised our full year guidance. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition. Jim will give you an update and take you through our second quarter highlights and then Mark will take you through our financial performance in more detail before we get into your questions. But before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to say a few words about the saving access to Laboratory Services Act, now called Salsa, the important new federal laboratory legislation recently introduced in Congress as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's recent ruling on our trade associations PAMA lawsuit. We're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced this legislation on both sides of the aisle. In our view, Salsa could fix PAMA permanently, setting the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule back on a sustainable path. In 2014, the intent of Congress when passing PAMA was to reform the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule to a single national fee schedule based on private payer rates for the clinical laboratory services. Unfortunately, the first round of data collection failed to collect the data from large significant segments of the marketplace. The result was billions of Medicare cuts over 3 years, with more on their way if Salsa is not passed. Our trade association is coordinated to Congressional Meetings along with public advocacy efforts that involves collaboration with the provider and patient communities. Last week, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision in the PAMA lawsuit filed in 2017 by our trade association, ACLA. In short, the court sided with ACLA and called the CMS's exclusion of hospital price data "arbitrary and capricious." Importantly, this case has been rejected for procedural reasons and this is the first opinion based on its merits. Unfortunately, the court is not requiring CMS to recalculate the flawed payment amounts. While disappointing, we believe this favorable ruling will give Congress additional strong grounds to finally fix PAMA's mini flaws by passing Salsa. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Davis.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Steve. Our base business performed well despite softer utilization trends which we believe impacted us and the rest of the health care industry. I'm proud of the efforts our team has made to grow our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since the end of the first quarter. We also ramped our investments to further accelerate growth in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In the quarter, we announced the selection of our next CFO, Sam Samad. Sam joins us from Illumina, where he served as Chief Financial Officer for 5-plus years. As many of you know, he brings a depth of health care experience that will help us in many ways. Prior to Illumina, Sam held several financial and operational leadership roles at Cardinal Health and Eli Lilly and Company. Sam, welcome to Quest Diagnostics.
Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. It's an honor to join the Quest Diagnostics team. In previous roles, I had the opportunity to observe the many contributions Quest is making to health care. Just arriving less than 2 weeks ago, I've been impressed by the passion and dedication of everyone that I've met so far. I'd like to thank Mark Guinan for his partnership during this transition. I'm excited to be here. Jim, I'll turn it back to you.
Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam and I look forward to working very closely with you. Now, turning to our performance in the second quarter. Total revenues were $2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $1.96 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $402 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $355 million in the second quarter, down approximately 31% from 2021 and 41% from the previous quarter. In July, with the spread of the BA4 and BA5 variance, we continue to see the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, consistent with the volumes we reported in June. Our positivity rate has increased since March and approximately 25% of the tests we performed in the first 2 weeks of July were positive. We believe that the COVID-19 trends since March contributed to the softness we observed in the broader health care utilization. As you've seen, we're successfully executing a strategy to increase our share of COVID-19 molecular testing. A key element of our strategy is to increase the number of testing access points through retail relationships. In addition to our CVS and Walmart relationships, we are now also collecting specimens at Rite Aid locations and the number of access points will continue to grow. Approximately half of our COVID-19 volume in the quarter came from retail channels. Quest is proud to have been selected by the CDC to participate in its increasing community access to testing, or ICATT program for COVID-19 testing. Through this program, qualified uninsured individuals can access COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing for zero out-of-pocket costs. In addition, we're pleased to be the provider of COVID-19 PCR testing for qualified insured and uninsured customers of Rite Aid nationwide for zero out-of-pocket expense. We now have approximately 6,000 COVID-19 patient access testing sites through retail relationships as well as our own patient service centers. Through these efforts, we estimate that we are performing approximately 8% of COVID-19 molecular testing in the U.S., up from approximately 4% in March. Finally, the public health emergency was extended into October which will help us maintain our current level of reimbursement. Based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for full year 2022 to between $1.15 billion and $1.30 billion. Now, turning to our base business. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. Our M&A funnel remains strong. We are in late-stage discussions with several hospital health systems on the purchase of their laboratory outreach business. This is in addition to our normal conversations we have with C-suite leaders on performing reference testing and providing professional lab services. While this pandemic paused some of these discussions, it has also created opportunities because of the financial and labor pressures that many hospital health systems are facing. We continue to accelerate growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues grew faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Health plans continue to see the value of working with us. Over the last 2 years, we have renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts with price increases. We expect more renewals with price increases this year. And we're proud to be selected as one of the UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year, providing physicians and patients with improved access, quality and value. Finally, we're pleased to share today that we have renewed our strategic relationship with Florida Blue. Florida continues to be an important large and growing state for us. Earlier this month, the CMS Transparency in Coverage Final Rules became effective to help consumers know the cost of a covered item or service before receiving care. Beginning July 1, 2022, group health plans and issuers of group or individual health insurance are required to post pricing information for covered items and services. We are leveraging that data to ensure patients and employers are aware of the value we offer. This trend will continue to gather momentum as more pricing transparency requirements will go into effect in the next 2 years. We believe that pricing transparency favors Quest Diagnostics which powers affordable care. We do this by offering clinical innovation, enabling better clinical outcomes through our quality, speed and accuracy of test results, improving the patient experience with accessible and easy-to-use patient resources and finally, reducing the cost of care. We continue to ramp our investments in advanced diagnostics capabilities. In the quarter, we saw growth from hematology, prenatal genetics and pharma services. We also introduced Quest AD Detect, a blood test to aid in the early assessment of Alzheimer's disease. We are seeing good early adoption from both primary care physicians and neurologists. Finally, last week, we launched the lab developed molecular test to aid in the detection of monkeypox. The test can differentiate monkeypox from other orthopox viruses and we will be able to perform nearly 30,000 tests a week by the end of July. In addition, we can expand testing to other laboratories in our network to further increase capacity if needed. We continue to see growth in direct-to-consumer testing, thanks to our COVID-19 offerings and more importantly, our base business testing. Within the base business testing category, we saw strong growth from testosterone, comprehensive metabolic panels and Lyme disease. We're excited about upcoming improved digital experience which we expect to debut later this year. We believe this improved experience will help us acquire, convert and retain more customers who visited QuestDirect digital platform. We expect to have much more to say about our improved digital experience before the end of this year. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains. We have several initiatives underway to make this happen. Focused on attracting and retaining our people, optimizing our network, automating and digitizing our processes and getting paid for the work we do. Here are three examples. One, we're partnering with universities to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology. We're also teaming up with a learning and development recruiting company to provide lobotomy certifications to prescreened candidates in exchange for a 2-year commitment to work at Quest. Two, our schedule at check-in initiative which encourages patients to make appointments has now expanded to 1,000 of our patient service sites. In one area which has implemented the program, we are seeing a 20% decrease in average wait times as well as an improvement in patient satisfaction. We're also building the payment process into the digital customer experience which frees up our phlebotomists to focus on specimen collection, thereby increasing their capacity and improving the patient-employee experience. Three, we continue to implement digital technology to provide end-to-end specimen tracking, including the arrival patterns that enable load leveling across the network which improves our productivity and provides greater transparency for our clients. We're not immune to the current inflationary environment and are managing through rising fuel and labor costs. Like many companies, higher-than-normal employee turnover in some job categories is impacting our ability to drive further productivity gains. However, these increased costs are in line with our expectations and are built into our guidance. We are expecting another year of solid Invigorate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. Finally, I'm very proud of our recently released 2021 corporate responsibility report and invite you all to download it. You can find it on our website. Among the highlights, in 2021, we launched our first formal materiality assessment to help identify the most significant ESG topics to the company and our stakeholders. Also, to enhance the level of our ESG disclosures, we began reporting in accordance with the SASB guidelines. We're very proud of the contributions Quest is making to empower better health and grateful to our 50,000 colleagues who are making that vision a reality every day. Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.45 billion, down 3.8% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 2.9% to $2.1 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 31% to $355 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 3.6% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 1.4% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes increased approximately 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew less than 1%. As we have seen in prior COVID surges, we experienced some softening of base testing volumes beginning in April as COVID-19 cases began to rise again throughout the spring. COVID-19 testing volumes were stronger than expected during the second quarter. Together with our JV partnership, Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 3.7 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 3.5 million molecular tests, down approximately 1.3 million tests and 2.8 million tests versus the prior year and first quarter, respectively. Our July COVID-19 molecular volumes have been consistent with the volumes we reported in June, averaging roughly 40,000 tests per day, excluding Sonora Quest. Revenue per requisition declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up modestly. As we have highlighted in recent quarters, the pricing environment has improved with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $388 million, or 15.8% of revenues compared to $533 million or 20.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $435 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $584 million or 22.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from nontraditional retail channels which carry additional expenses and logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and slightly lower average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular tests. In the quarter, approximately half of our COVID-19 molecular volume came through our retail partners versus roughly 1/3 last year. We expect the mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes through this channel to continue to grow in the third quarter. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $4.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.18 last year. Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $882 million in 2022 versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Given the limited M&A activity, we repurchased $200 million in stock during the second quarter. Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.75 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.35 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.3 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.24 to $8.64 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 15,000 to 25,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. As we look toward 2023, we continue to assume our COVID-19 molecular testing run rate in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-October. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could be renewed beyond October, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we have successfully grown our share of COVID-19 molecular testing through our retail partners which accounted for approximately 50% of our COVID-19 molecular volume in the second quarter. As these retail partnerships continue to expand, we expect the mix through this channel to continue to grow throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to incur incremental costs to serve this channel. As COVID-19 positivity rates remain in the double digits, our ability to pull specimens for COVID-19 molecular testing continues to be limited. As a reminder, we are ramping investments to accelerate growth this year. We spent approximately $70 million in the first half of the year and we expect these investments to continue to ramp in Q3 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IT costs are temporary but variable marketing costs will increase following the launch of the new site. We'll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. As many of you know, this will be Mark's last earnings call as he is retiring next week. Mark, you've been a key member of our leadership team as we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. I'm grateful for everything you've done for the company, especially for the last 2.5 years of the pandemic. I would miss your partnership and consult as we navigated many challenges over nearly a decade. I wish you and your family, health and happiness as you approach the next chapter in your life. Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Quest is a special place and it has been an honor to serve as CFO for the last 9 years. Thanks to the analysts and investors on this call. I have enjoyed working with all of you. My family and I are excited for what lies ahead.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, as Jim shared, we had another good quarter driven by our efforts through share of COVID-19 testing while we believe our base business performed in line with the software utilization trends we're seeing in health care. We have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022. Finally, we're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced the saving access to Laboratory Services Act and fully support the passage of this important legislation. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator:  Our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Mark, congrats on the upcoming retirement and thanks for all the help over the years. So I guess, just my question on the base business, I mean, you called out some of the softness, right? I mean do you guys think that it's more COVID driven with the current mini surge that we're seeing? Or just any color you can share with us on that? And maybe I guess, Steve, taking it a little bit further, how are you thinking about the business today as we face a recession down the road in terms of the defensiveness of the volumes and the business overall as we get past COVID?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. So thanks, Brian, for the question. So as we indicated, we were a little softer in the second quarter where the base business than what we expected in the second quarter. And we do believe there's a relationship, as we have said before, between pickup in COVID infections and the amount of people that are going into their physicians and to some extent, what's happening with hospitals, even though that's a secondary slowdown, if at all. And the second part of your question is longer term with worries about a potential slowdown in our economy and approaching recession. What's our view on that and we're taking a hard look at what happened over the last 10 to 15 years of our business. And things did change quite a bit over the last decade, as you know. The first -- over the last recession, the big -- Great Recession, 2008, we have in parallel with that, the Affordable Care Act. We also had changes with health care policy and we had PAMA, so there's a lot of other effects. And so yes, we do believe there may be some impact in our business related to a slowdown in the economy and the recession. We do believe that we're so essential through the delivery of health care and the need for health care going forward that we believe that utilization will continue to be reasonable throughout any up and down in an economic cycle. So -- but we're taking a look at it and we're seeing if there's any differences this time around, as you know, maybe people were saying this is an unusual set of circumstances given what's happened with health care and what's happened in the economy over the last 2 to 3 years. So Jim, anything you'd like to add to what we see with our base business?
Jim Davis: Yes, Steve, what I would add is, look, we're in close touch with the payers. And the payers have indicated to us and you saw UnitedHealthcare's announcement earlier this week, that they saw softer utilization of health care services as well. In addition to that, we track a group of Quest accounts that we know are 100% loyal to us. We call it our same-store sales analysis. And we noticed in the quarter that it was basically flat, those accounts that are 100% loyal. So, the other thing we look at is just the mix business. And we noticed our general health and wellness panels grew at a lower rate than some of our infectious disease, non-COVID infectious disease and chronic care types of testing that we do. So we -- based on all that information, we come to the conclusion that the base was certainly softer this quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: I want to offer my congratulations to Mark and best wishes and welcome, aboard, Sam. Look forward to working with you. Maybe I'll just pivot over to talk about margins. Obviously, within the base business, you've called out some inflationary pressures. They seem like they've been manageable. But you also talked about the Invigorate savings and they're largely offsetting it. I wonder if you could just sort of comment on how you're viewing base business margins? And then I'm assuming also on the COVID-related testing. As long as the PHE is in place, that margin is stable but has there been any reason to think that, that has changed? We get the aggregate margin but I'm wondering about the underlying trends there. If you could just comment on it and how much that factored into your back half guidance outlook as well? Any changes?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, A.J., for the questions. Let me start with COVID. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our COVID business, the good news was a lot more volume, a lot more revenue, a lot more dollars of operating margin. However, with that also goes less pooling, a larger mix shift towards the retail outlets which have higher expenses. And then we have had some slight erosion versus last year on average reimbursement a couple of dollars, not anything super significant. So the margin percentage was less but still, its contribution to the bottom line from COVID was much higher. As we look into the back half at this point, we don't know where the positivity rates are going to go but we've not assumed a material change in the amount of pooling. We would expect to continue with the current mix or potentially grow that as a proportion of our total COVID volumes. So within the ranges, that's kind of how we're seeing the balance of the year play out on COVID. So if the positivity rate drops down and the positive rate, I'm looking at Jim here, has been as high as we've seen through the pandemic, now a lot more people are doing rapid antigen testing and so on, we believe that the cases are underreported. But we believe that the prevalence of COVID right now is extremely high. And so in the earlier answer that we provided to Brian around the base business, there has been a historical negative correlation between those. And we do believe that the base business has absolutely been impacted by the surge in COVID. We just aren't sure how long it will last. On the base business, we've shared that as we built our plan and the ranges for 2022, we built in a higher SWB, salary work benefits assumption that was in our guidance. And certainly, that's something we control and that's really within expectations. We have a couple of billion dollars that we have long-term contracts. And so really not exposed to inflation in a short window for that. But then we have some other costs where we don't have long-term contracts and there are things that everybody is familiar with and you've heard from other companies as well, things like fuel, things like housekeeping, security, temporary labor. And so those areas have been a little more inflationary than we would have anticipated going into the year. The good news is those are in our results year-to-date during our guidance. We're not expecting that to go away immediately. We certainly hope it's not long-term inflation unlike where if you have wage inflation, you generally expect will continue. If you add contractual inflation with your key suppliers around reagents and other things that might be longer term as well or certainly a couple of years. We don't know how long this spike is going to last. But I can tell you, it's probably like $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter in the first half and we're not expecting that to change. We hope it might but in the guidance that we provided. So hopefully, that's helpful, A.J.
Steve Rusckowski: And A.J., just so it's clear. You all know that the Emergency Act has been extended and so we're assuming in our guidance that will be extended through October but we're not assuming in our guidance that it extends past October until we have certainty around that, okay? So that is the assumption and what we've just provided for guidance for the remainder of the year. And I think since you asked, A.J., Jim, why don't you comment a little bit about the opportunities we still see around the bigger rate and you mentioned in our opening remarks about the things we have changed. But why don't you chat a little bit about why we're still bullish on the prospects of improving productivity.
Jim Davis: Yes. So A.J., as we've talked in the past, there's still certainly a lot of opportunity around automation of manual processes in the laboratory. I touched on in my comments around some of the automated check-in procedures. So we've long had appointment scheduling. What we've added recently is when a patient walks into the PSC without an appointment, you actually go to the check in and you -- and if the wait room is full, you schedule an appointment at that point. And what we've seen is it really does help productivity in the PSC, as well as if the patient leaves, they may not come back to Quest. If they make an appointment to come back in 2 hours or the next day, we feel like the patient retention is better. But automation, the use of artificial intelligence in terms of readouts of manual curves and laboratories, all of that work continues. And then I'd tell you, the other thing that will help continue to drive productivity is our work around retention of our employees. So our productivity, like all companies, we're seeing a much higher increase in turnover. We feel like it is stabilized, albeit at a higher point. So as we now drive retention higher and turnover lower that will certainly help our productivity efforts in the back half of the year.
Mark Guinan: And I just want to add one thing about peace in the back half. Steve talked about the potential for the PHE to not be extended which at this point, we're not assuming it does extend. But I want to remind people that the price drop is not a full margin drop because when we get to beyond the PHE, first off, there's not absolute certainty but most people would expect the positivity rate will be significantly lower. We can pool a lot more. So we can get some margin offset there dollar-wise. And then, the second one is that the retail relationships that we have will change in the structure. We know how that's going to work. And basically, the significant costs we're incurring right now to get that volume for the retail outlets will go away because it's only permitted under the PHE. It's complicated but it will go away. So while the value per requisition will drop to whatever price we end up with and people have talked about the CMS rate that was originally published and certainly, that's potential, over time, that's not all a margin hit because there's some other costs that go away. So we still will make a decent percentage margin, certainly fewer dollars per patient encounter. But I just want to make sure people are clear that COVID profitability doesn't fall completely off the cliff when the PHE goes away.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: First, Sam, congrats. I think you're going to be a great for the Quest. And Mark, of course, really enjoyed working together. But before you go, I do have more margin questions for you here.
Mark Guinan: Let me go otherwise, Jack, Thanks.
Jack Meehan: Of course. So specifically, can you just talk about what was the COVID testing margin in the quarter? Or how did it compare to the overall margin? And I guess what I'm trying to get into is just like how much of the sequential step down in earnings might have been related to the margin impacts you've talked about?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Jack, as you know, we don't provide specific margins on subsegments of our business. But what I can give you directionally is I referred to half of our volume coming from retail channels or nontraditional channels and we talked about dollar-wise, what the incremental cost per counter is there. A year ago, in the second quarter, it was about 1/3 of our volume. So you can see that's pretty significant. In the second quarter last year, we did quite a bit of pooling and that's varied in the interim quarters between that and now but there was quite a bit of pooling last year because the positivity rate had fallen -- very well. I think many of us by June of last year were thinking this might have been behind us before Delta hit us. And this quarter, we expected in our plans to do quite a bit of pooling but in reality, it was not a large amount. So that should give you a little bit of idea. The other thing I did mention a couple of dollars erosion on the average reimbursement. So I think you got all the pieces, not going to provide a specific number but that should help you understand. But I think the key thing is that the dollars we earned off COVID was much better than our plans. And that's -- and we expect it to continue and that's why we're rising guidance. So while the percentage was worse, the dollar bottom line was better.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Jack, as you know, in Q1, we did about $600 million worth of COVID. And in the second quarter that we're talking about right now, it was roughly $350 million. So that was a material change in COVID. And as Mark has gone through, there's a lot more dynamics in what the margin is in COVID. But essentially, that sequential compare and our margin drop is primarily related to the drop in COVID testing.
Jack Meehan: Got it. If I can squeeze in one more on the core business. What are your expectations for merit increases and SW&B this year? Have that changed at all?
Steve Rusckowski: Jim, do you want to take that?
Jim Davis: No, it hasn't changed at all, Jack. We said 3% to 4% for the year. We're still within that guidance. We've already provided the merit increase for the year. We do that annually in the April time frame. So it's already in the Q2 numbers for sure.
Mark Guinan: Yes. As Jim referenced, the vast majority of our increase has already taken place. Certainly, like all other companies, we have some off-cycle adjustments based on promotions and other things. But most of the "inflationary headwinds" in SWB were incurred in the second quarter. So if you look sequentially, that's one of the drivers of margin reduction first quarter to second quarter. That's been a historical event as well. That's not new. But we don't anticipate going forward to see significant inflation beyond kind of the run rate we were on in Q2.
Steve Rusckowski: Jim and I actually in a couple of financial conferences try to dimensionalize what's going on with our wage bill. And we talked about of the 50,000 people that the most pressure we see is what there really are real frontline people and they're primarily what we call specimen processors. When the specimens come into our laboratories, they do the sorting, it's a tough job. It's at night and we're paying them, we think, fairly and we've increased that for their hourly wages. And the second is couriers. And to give you an idea because it is the area of most pressure, roughly, it's about 10% to 11% of our workforce salary, okay? So -- and at the same time, it represents a larger percentage of our workforce count of the 50,000 people. So that's where we have the most pressure. So even if that number went up, considerably, you get an idea of the impact that would have on our margins. So that's where we see the most pressure, okay?
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Sam, looking forward to continue to work with you and not to put you on the spot on your first call here. But I'm sure on the way in, as you know, there's a lot of questions as you've seen on this call already in terms of the margin and the margin profile going into kind of next year as we work our way through kind of the high margin COVID coming out, some of the expenses around DTC and retail, wage inflation. I guess when you came in and Mark, feel free in to chime in obviously but Sam, I guess how did you get comfortable with that? It would just be helpful maybe to hear your perspective on that as I'm sure it was a key consideration, something you dug into on your way in and I know investors are hyper focused on that piece as well. So if you're willing, I would love to hear your general thoughts on kind of how we work our way through the margin side as we kind of work our way into next year.
Sam Samad: Yes. Patrick, thanks for the welcome and I look forward to working with you and the rest of the folks on the call as well. Listen, it's really early days. I've been here in -- I'm in my second week here. So all I can tell you is coming in, obviously, we're in a challenging environment right now. But Quest has an incredible reputation with incredible people that really provide a significant value to health care. So I've been so far really impressed with the passion that I've seen people here, the knowledge and the contributions that I think we can make in health care. So I'm going to punt a little bit on your question because it's really early days and really ask Mark to more comment on it but I'm very excited about how we can work through these challenges. But it's really early days, Patrick. I'm in my second week here. So I'll let maybe Mark talk about it more.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Patrick, appreciate the question. We know where people's heads are at right now around the business and that's where ours are as well. So I can assure you we're spending a lot of time on that. We've spent a lot of time on that. There's a number of things that we generally control. And then there are some things that are a little bit less in our control. So we do our best to forecast those things. We put together ranges. And then we -- I think and believe we're very transparent with you about how those things play out. So you get a sense of, okay, well, what really is going on in the business? And because of that, I believe that, generally, we've not surprised people. And we've given you delivered on your expectations. We've given you timely updates. We've given you interim information. And based on my time with Sam and I think the team here, I would expect that to continue. So you would expect that with my departure that we're not going to change the way we talk to, the way we share, give all those updates. I think everybody appreciates what a great job Shawn does and know they can call them any time, any place and get him and he'll be as transparent as possible. So really, I think what it comes down to is, I believe we're focused on the right things. And also, I believe we do our best job of being as transparent as possible around all those key drivers.
Patrick Donnelly: Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate it guys. And then Steve, maybe a quick one. You've continued to talk about more constructive conversations with some of the covering lives and payers. Can you just talk about, I guess, the kind of outlook on pricing? It seems as confident as you guys have sounded on that front in years. Maybe just talk about how you're feeling on the pricing side given some of those payer conversations?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So thanks for the question. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made with all payers and where we are today versus when I started which was over 10 years ago. We've got a network now that is the strongest network that we've ever had. And I would say our relationship with all the significant payers, national and regional is very strong. And they are increasingly realizing that it's good for their membership and good for their competitiveness in the market to have us in the network and we bring a lot of value. And so we're entirely focused on what we call powering affordable care which is consistent with what Jim has driven in the company around making sure that we have great quality, great service and a great experience. And you heard earlier from Jim as we continue to push on just working smarter and by working smarter, we're getting more productivity but we're also going to have a better product. And payers understand that. And so as Jim mentioned, we have gotten some increases from the payers over the last several negotiation rounds. We continue to believe that is something we're going to continue to push for because we do bring a lot of value in the marketplace. And we're very competitive in the marketplace. And so if you look at the price effect that we saw in the quarter and what we have typically said in the past historically, remember, historically, we said you should plan at about 100 basis points with the price effect. Well, in this quarter, in the last quarter, we've actually saw less than that. And that's the best position we bet in. And I will share within that envelope, the commercial payer portion of it is significantly less than where we've been historically. But we still see pressure with price, with our hospital business, with our client bill business and that's in that envelope as well. But on the commercial payer side, we're in a very different place than we were before. And I'll share with you a part of Jim and I on my transition is Jim and I are going into the nationals and the regional payers and we're talking about what we've done in the past and more importantly, what we're doing in the future. We just had a meeting last week with one of the national payers and they see us as a much more significant player in the marketplace than what people think about us as which is a laboratory. We're much more of the lab. We actually help them improve the value of health care going forward. So a much better place than where we were in a good place right now.
Mark Guinan: And so what I will add is that we really moved the needle on commercial. Over the last couple of years, we've talked about more pricing pressure in the client bill which is, as Steve referenced the hospital and then in some cases, where we contract directly with physicians. But instead of being a headwind on price, I will tell you that starting next year and going forward, I would expect that -- to be at least neutral, if not a tailwind. So we've moved it from a major headwind to be at least neutral and more likely positive. So wanted to dimensionalize a little more why you're hearing the positive comments for us. And it's in really recognition of what Steve said which is our strategic value to them. We're not a commoditized provider of a laboratory result. There's so much more to how we're helping them and then these value-based contracts that we referenced were based on performance, we can earn a better payment for ourselves. And so because of that, we really, really moved the environment and the relationships with the commercial payers.
Operator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Mark, it's a pleasure working with you over these years. And Sam, I look forward to working with you in the future. Quick two part on the inflation side. So the first one is a follow-up on the pricing question that you just gave. Can you quantify what the better commercial rates are for 2023 because you priority locked it in at this point versus 2022? And then a follow-up on A.J.'s question just to make sure I understand, you were seeing an additional $0.05 to $0.08 of inflationary pressures. Was that more or less than you expected when you guys gave guidance on the fourth quarter call? And then on previous calls, you talked about sort of the 2023 EPS of $8.50. Should we add those inflationary pressures against that $8.50? Or can you offset those with increased efficiency as well as the new recent COVID retail agreements you've done?
Mark Guinan: Well, thanks for all the questions, Pito. I'll start with 2023. We've not locked down our plan. And if we did, we generally don't give specific guidance until our fourth quarter earnings call. And I'll leave it to the management team. I'll be leaving exactly when they decide to do that but we're not going to comment any specifics around 2023. In terms of the amount of the increases, again, I'm not going to dimensionalize. We don't have a planned lockdown. But we have enough contracts that are already set for next year and enough progress on some that are either, as we referenced like Florida Blue or some others that are getting close to being locked down for renewal that I have confidence to say what I said which is, this is not going to be a next year for us on a price perspective...
Steve Rusckowski: So just to add to that, so what you're hearing from us is, yes, we hear your comments about inflation. And yes, we have inflationary pressure. And yes, we're managing that. But what you're also hearing from us is we're in a better price position than we've been in. You need to think about that too and thinking about the prospect of what we're going to do in '23. We're not going to provide guidance. But we still feel confident with what we shared at Investor Day in 2021 around the prospects of what we're going to do going forward.
Mark Guinan: And yes, so I was going to continue that what you're hearing from us is what's happening now, Pito. And the $0.05 to $0.08 is more inflation than we would have anticipated. However, other things have changed as well. Most notably, we did a lot more COVID. So we delivered a lot more earnings. So just like we don't expect the high level of COVID and we could be wrong to expect and continue into 2023. Also, we'd be really disappointed if the inflation we're seeing in the noncontracted areas were to carry to 2023. But even if it does, we've got multiple pieces that are moving, including a better pricing environment in the commercial book. So in no way, shape or form, are we saying that when you put all these together, that, that $8.50 or in that range is not something we're still confident in.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Mark, wishing you best of luck in the future and really enjoyed working with you. So thank you for all the color always and your patience. In terms of the question, I just want to go back to the utilization environment. I mean you gave some color there but what we're hearing from the managed care companies is that the softness that they're seeing is the ER visits and inpatient admissions which shouldn't really have an impact on lab testing, right, if it's more outside the four walls of the hospitals. So can you maybe give us color on where are you seeing softness in utilization by geography and maybe by end market, i.e., what type of test? And how do you think about it, right, sort of 2.5 years into the pandemic? What's structural in the software utilization versus transition in your view?
Mark Guinan: If I can just start quickly and then I'll pass it on to Jim. So Ricky, our source is not just seeing their medical loss ratios. But I'd point to two things in addition to what Jim talked about earlier which is our same-store sales as we call it. So one is we actually get data from the payers, okay, in total. So we know how many patient encounters they had for laboratory work. We know what our volume was and we can see that. The good news is we continue to gain share in those commercial books. However, we continue to see their total volume has been down, certainly in the second quarter. So it's payer data that's being provided by them to us that is the confidence to say, utilization has dipped in our space. The other one is I'd point to the  data which is based on billings of other independent labs. And if you look at that, that certainly suggests that utilization is down. So while you may be hearing its emergency room and inpatient, the data that we have and the best data we have also suggests that the market in which we operate is also depressed in the second quarter.
Steve Rusckowski: And the second part is, remember COVID and we're 2 years into it. And every time COVID infections go up, our base business comes down some. And if you think about a physician and what they need to do to run their offices and as you know, a large portion of our business is through physicians in their offices, if there's call outs of their staff or if their patients are missing their appointments because they are now infected, it affects volume. So there's no question there's a correlation. And the good news for us is when that happens, our COVID business goes up, right? So Jim, why should...
Jim Davis: Ricky, the last thing I'd say is we're not immune to hospital. The inpatient work -- remember, we get $1 billion a year in reference work. We have another $0.5 billion in PLS. So when inpatient and outpatient procedures are down, that certainly does affect our business on the health system, hospital side. On the physician office side, again, we closely look at a set of accounts spread across the country that we know are 100% loyal to Quest and we measure that we call it same-store sales. Again, our general health and wellness panels from a mix standpoint, were certainly lower than some of our chronic disease panels in the quarter. And then the last thing, geographic mix. We've talked and it hasn't changed dramatically that our book of business in New York City is down still low to mid-double digits. On the other hand, we see incredibly strong growth in the southern part of the country, in the southeast portion as well as the southwest and parts of the West. So if there's been a population migration out of New York City into the southeast, then we're certainly seeing some of that in our business.
Operator: Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: This is John  on for Derik. And thanks for all the colors and thanks for being out the initiatives for renew  you were going to ask. But in addition to that and in addition to the price increases you're expecting and the plan to clamp down the employee turnover, how should we think about the incremental spend in 2023? Are you thinking about ramping these down to offset the inflationary pressure? And on PAMA, could you just remind us what your expectations are in '23, especially if nothing else happens on the legislative front?
Jim Davis: Yes. So in terms of 2023, as Mark said, there's a lot of moving parts at this point. We're committed to investments in advanced diagnostics. We're committed to investments in our consumer direct consumer initiated testing business. Obviously, we can modulate those things if we see inflation getting worse. But at this point, we can't give you any further guidance than what we've given you around those. We're committed to advanced diagnostics, we're committed to our clinical -- our consumer direct -- consumer-initiated testing business. In terms...
Steve Rusckowski: So just to add to that, because we've commented on this before, it's important to think about this as you think about '23. We started to make investments in 2020 to accelerate growth beyond what we had already invested in to accelerate growth. So think about '20 and '21 and now we're at to '22. And we obviously would not make investments unless we thought there would be a return. And so therefore, you have heard from us, you're seeing growth rates in advanced diagnostics that have come up, you've heard about us feeling good about our consumer-initiated testing, growing faster than we have seen growing in the past. And as you think about '23, you should think about the improvements you're going to see in those two businesses in relationship with that in what we invested. And so therefore, you should not think about this as headwinds because you really think about it as tailwinds because we will get a return on those investments we made over the last several years. Jim?
Jim Davis: Yes. You asked about PAMA. And we've said that it's in our 2023 guidance outlook that we provided at this point and we've said it's about a $90 million headwind.
Mark Guinan: So the only thing I would add is that, to Steve's point, when you ask our investments ramping down, I think there's two ways to think of investments. One is what's the P&L net impact and what is the level of spend. So we, at Investor Day, talked about growing our direct consumer business to $0.5 billion by 2025. That is still our intention. So as you can imagine, over the next several years, including 2023, we're expecting significant revenue growth. And in order to drive that revenue growth, we believe we need to spend more. However, the good news is that a lot of 2020 and 2021 was pre-revenue, pre-contribution margin. And as we go ahead, we would expect the net impact to actually be less and to be less of a headwind. So really, we're going to be investing less on the bottom line but spending more money to drive that accelerated growth. And then obviously, when we get to the scale and size that we're aspiring to, then we expect a healthy margin on that business.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Madelin Malman  on for Matt Larew. Just going off of the previous question for your investments into the base business. I know previously, you've given a number around $160 million for this year. Do you anticipate it's still being about that? Has inflation driven that cost higher? Any color you have there? And then my other question, just speaking to your investments in advanced diagnostics. You mentioned that you are ahead of schedule for your anticipated 8% growth. Is that still the case?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So let me take part of it, then I'm sure either Steve or Jim will jump in. So first of all, inflation really hasn't impacted the level of investment in a material way. And we're on track to spend about what we told you previously. As I referenced a minute ago, we haven't put our final plans together. But at this point, I would expect we're going to spend more next year. And we're going to spend more in marketing but we're going to spend a lot less and not much at all in the IT platform creation. So it's really going to be tied a very high variable cost and highly tied to revenue growth and we'll monitor, as Jim says and I'm sure Sam and Jim will be all over is to make sure we're making the progress and to make sure we don't get the spending ahead of ourselves. But if we do what we expect to do and we need to do to get to $0.5 billion by 2025, the spending will continue to go up. The only other dimension I want to mention here is because when we talk about investments in the base business, there's a little nuance here. Advanced diagnostics absolutely is the base business. But really this consumer business is new. So while a lot of the work we do is similar to what we've done historically in our base business, it's really a new business category or opportunity. And some of it may cannibalize what would have otherwise come through our traditional channels. But we do believe that a lot of it is actually incremental to the overall amount of volume that we perform. Jim or Steve, you want to...
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So as you know, we don't generally give you numbers every quarter about different segments of our business. In advanced diagnostics, we generally give you an annual update and we'll do that again. But we keep on indicating that we believe we are making progress of getting to a higher level of growth, as we indicated in our Investor Day in '21. We feel good about the progress. And we gave you a number in the beginning of the year. And the same is true about our consumer initiated testing. We periodically give you an update to show that we're making progress. So we're feeling good about the investments made, the returns we'll get. And again, you should see more returns in our '23 guidance or the expectations around that because we believe they still remain to be good opportunities.
Jim Davis: And just to clarify, the target that we outlined at the Investor Day for the direct-to-consumer business was $250 million by 2025.
Mark Guinan: My apologies.
Operator: Our last question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.
Rachel Vatnsdal: So can you spend a minute talking about the monkeypox market? You flagged in your prepared remarks that Quest was 1 of the 5 labs that was selected by the CDC to expand testing capacity and you guys are going to have roughly 30,000 testing capacity for a week. So can you just walk us through the market opportunity there? And then is this contemplated in the guidance at all?
Steve Rusckowski: Jim will handle that.
Jim Davis: Yes. So at this point, it's hard to anticipate what the market opportunity has been or will be. I can tell you, our testing volumes at this point are modest. If we've done 500, 600 tests that would be on the high side. However, it is growing. And we do see growth. We've only had the test up and running for 2 weeks. And over that 2-week period, it's grown day by day. Right now, we're not yet approved for New York state. We expect that to happen within the next week or 2. I'm sure you're reading that, that is where the major outbreak is in New York City. So we would expect to participate in that market. But most of our volume at this point is coming actually off of the West Coast. And so we'll keep you updated on what we're seeing.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then in line of the  environment, can you just walk us through some initial color on how you're considering use of cash between share repurchases, dividends and then M&A?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So we're going to continue with what we've done. And what that is, is that between the dividend and we've already gotten there this year with the share repurchases to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And with the $1.7 billion guidance and $400 million of capital, says at least $650 million between the dividend share repurchases and we already covered that. As we've also shared, we rather do M&A than share repurchases because we have some very rigorous financial parameters around the deals that we do. And so it's really going to be situational quarter-by-quarter. It may be different. Jim referenced that we have a deep pipeline and actually also commented that we have some negotiations that are well advanced. So I think we'd all be very disappointed if we didn't execute some deals before the end of the year. Don't know the exact timing of those. But certainly, as I said, I'd rather spend more on M&A and I know Steve would and you'll hear from Sam and Jim as they take over the reins, their view but I wouldn't expect it to materially change. So really no change to what we've done in the past. And at this point, no specific plans for cash deployment because we're really -- it's really dependent on that progression of the M&A.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. So thank you, everyone. And again, thank you, Mark, for your time here at Quest. We're going to miss you and we wish you well. So thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate all your questions and support and we'll see you in our travels. Have a good day.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. 00:16 Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: 00:23 Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO-Elect; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. 00:34 During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. 01:08 The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. 01:40 For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. 02:14 Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: 02:18 Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we’re off to a good start in 2022. We drove a strong year-over-year growth in our base business, which excludes COVID-19 testing. COVID-19 volumes remain strong early in the quarter and decreased in February and March, in line with the market. 02:42 We continue to make investments to further accelerate growth in the base business, and our efforts to improve productivity are helping us to offset inflationary pressures. So, based on the strength of our business we’re raising our 2022 guidance. This morning, I’ll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2022 and then Mark will provide more detail on the financial results and talk about our updated financial outlook for 2022. 03:12 But first, I like to ask Jim Davis to give us an update on our leadership transition. Jim?
Jim Davis: 03:19 Yeah, thank you Steve. We are making very good progress on the transition. Yesterday, we announced a series of organizational changes and leadership appointments of seasoned executive designed to help us accelerated growth and drive operational excellence. First category is a Senior Vice President of the regional businesses. Kathy has deep knowledge of our business gained through three decades of leadership at Quest. She will oversee the regional and enterprise operations, the commercial organization and marketing. She will also be responsible for driving operational excellence, including   for company's quality and productivity initiatives. 04:01 Next, Carrie Eglinton Manner is taking on an expanded role as Senior Vice President, , Advanced and General Diagnostics Clinical Solutions. For more than five years, Carrie has been responsible for bringing innovative solutions to the market through Quest clinical franchises. Before joining Quest, Carrie had nearly two decades of leadership experience in healthcare and medical technologies. 04:25 Patrick Plewman, who has led our West region and has been with Quest Diagnostics for more than nine years is named Senior Vice President, Diagnostics Services, which is a portfolio of data driven analytics and services businesses, which enabled employers, providers, pharma companies, and others to deliver healthcare more effectively and efficiently. This portfolio includes employer population health, employer solutions, ExamOne, Healthcare Analytics Solutions, and Quest HealthConnect. And before joining Quest, Patrick had over 20 years of leadership experience in the biotech and molecular diagnostics industries. 05:09 Mark Delaney has joined Quest as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has responsibility for the commercial team, including sales and sales operations. Previously, he helped senior sales and marketing leadership roles over his 30 year career at GE Healthcare and Hillrom. 05:29 And finally, Richard Adams has joined Quest as Vice President and General Manager of our Consumer Initiated Testing Business, a new role. Richard has two decades of varied leadership experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, and customer experience, and will lead our rapidly growing direct-to-consumer testing business. These appointments demonstrate the investment strength of our management team and we're really excited about the leadership and expertise that both Mark and Richard Adams will bring to us. 06:00 Additionally, we're making very good progress on our CFO selection process and are on track to name a leader in the next several months. The management transition is going very well and the changes we've announced yesterday are an important step in positioning us for the future. 06:16 Steve, I'll now turn it back to you.
Steve Rusckowski: 06:18 Thanks, gentlemen. I agree the transition is going well. Now, turning to our results, our base business continued its strong recovery up more than 6% from the prior year. Total revenues were $2.6 billion; earnings per share was $2.92 on a reported basis, and $3.22 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $480 million. 06:50 COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $600 million in the first quarter and that’s down approximately 28% from 2021. Nearly 60% of the COVID-19 revenues came from the Omicron peak in January. We project  demand for PCR testing through the end of the year and into 2023, albeit at lower levels. 07:16 The public health emergency was extended into July, maintaining our current level of reimbursement. And based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for the full-year of 2022 to between $850 million to $1 billion. 07:36 Turning to our base business, in the first quarter, we continue to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. So, here are some highlights from the quarter. We continue to make in-roads with our health plans, gaining share and increasing revenues faster than the market. 07:58 Our health plan revenues without COVID-19 grew faster that our overall base business did in the quarter. We also deepened relationships with payers through value based contracting. We currently had about 30% of our health plan revenues are tied to value based elements. And these included patient health outcomes, quality or shared savings. 08:23 We think we could grow this about 50% over the next few years. And we believe these value based contracts are achieving better alignment with health plans, which we believe will allow us to gain shares. 08:37 We're also working with our hospital health system leaders to help them execute their last strategy. A lot of partnerships of Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, Memorial Hermann in Texas, and those which really helped that work in  are performing well. 08:58 Hospitals look to us for their help with through laboratory design, staffing and management and we can enable them to monetize outreach lab assets that help them free-up needed capital. We have continued to make important investments to strengthen our advanced diagnostics capabilities and are already seeing results. 09:21 We continue to make investments to accelerate growth in oncology, hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services, and power services. Since we’ve ramped up our investments, and our advanced diagnostics portfolio, we have already accelerated growth by several 100 basis points and expect to deliver the 8% growth earlier than 2024, which we committed to at our 2021 Investor Day. 09:54 We remain excited about the opportunities we see in the direct-to-consumer testing market. As you know, we're ramping up investments in our consumer business and it’s having an impact. 10:06 In the quarter, our direct-to-consumer revenues more of than doubled compared to the prior year, driven by strong growth in both our COVID-19 testing operations as well as our base business testing. We’re seeing continuous solid demand for  comprehensive metabolic panels and complete blood counts. Also our new and approved digital experience is on track to launch later this year. 10:33 Finally, we've been expanding our diagnostics services portfolio. We are collaborating with a small digital  software firm to deliver diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostic patient service centers across the United States. This will aid in the screening of patients as part of the diabetes management program. 10:58 The second part of our strategies is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and costs thereby driving productivity gains. We are not immune to the current inflationary environment, but we're tightly managing our operations and are expecting another good year of the bigger rate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. 11:26 So, by way of our example, our procurement team continues to work with our strategic suppliers to mitigate potential price increases and improved productivities through our long-term relationships. Also today, the team has effectively managed challenges in our global supply chain. 11:46 We also look to our suppliers to deliver innovation to help us a lower overall cost of testing and improved quality. The most recent example is the rollout of our new   that is being deployed across our laboratory network. 12:04 Our new lab in Clifton, New Jersey has been operational for about a year and we are seeing incremental productivity gains from the investment we’ve made in automation and artificial intelligence. 12:16 Our new   initiative encourages patients to make appointments allowing us to better manage demand and  productivity while enhancing the patient experience. The system has been successfully deployed to over 700 patient service centers. Our continued invested in operations is producing results. And we are well on our way to achieving our targeted productivity gains of 3% of our cost structure in 2022. 12:50 Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights and our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Mark?
Mark Guinan: 12:59 Thanks, Steve. In first quarter, consolidated revenues were 2.61 billion, down 4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to more than 2 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 27.6% to approximately 600 million. Revenues for Diagnostic information services declined 3.9% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. 13:39 Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year and was roughly flat under an organic basis. Total base testing volumes increased more than 6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew nearly 5%. We experienced some modest softening of base testing volumes in January during the peak of the Omicron surge. The volume has rebounded in February and March. 14:11 COVID-19 testing volumes surged during the spread of Omicron variant during the winter and volumes peaked in January, but declined through the month of February and into March. Together with our JV partners in our Quest, we resulted approximately 7.2 million molecular tests. 14:30 Quest  resulted roughly 6.3 million molecular test, down approximately 2 million tests and 1 million tests versus the prior year in fourth quarter respectively. We also resulted nearly 450,000 serology tests in the first quarter. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have generally stabilized and the average of roughly 30,000 tests per day over the last four weeks, excluding similar request. 14:59 Revenue per acquisition declined 5.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rep was up modestly. Importantly, we continue to see an improving price environment. Unit price reimbursement pressure was less than 100 basis points in the quarter. 15:21 Reported operating income in the first quarter was 513 million or 19.7% of revenues compared to 660 million or 24.3% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was 554 million or 21.2% of revenues, compared to 708 million or 26% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income was primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses or logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and lower average reimbursements for COVID-19 molecular tests. These   were partially offset by strong growth in our base business. 16:16 As many of you have heard, the health resources and services administration or HRSA, stopped accepting claims to pass and treat uninsured patients on March 22, due to insufficient funding.  runs the program to provide funding for COVID-19 testing vaccination and treatment for uninsured patients. Approximately 14% of our COVID-19 molecular testing volume has come from uninsured patients, which is much higher than the 1% to 2% we typically see in our base business. 16:50 As a result, we were unable to build HRSA to over 20 million in COVID-19 testing work that was performed just prior to the March 23 HRSA cut-off date. Moving forward, we are now dealing uninsured patients for COVID-19 testing directly upfront. As a result, we've seen a decline in our uninsured COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in late March and into April, and this is reflected in trends I shared earlier. 17:19 Reported EPS was $2.92 in the quarter, compared to $3.46 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, compared to $3.76 last year. Cash provided by operations was $480 million in Q1 versus $731 million in the prior year period. And we repurchased 350 million of stock during the first quarter. 17:47 Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between 9.2 billion and 9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.35 billion and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. 18:10 COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between 850 million and 1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 69%. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.88 and $8.38, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 and $9.50. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least 1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 400 million. 18:43 Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance, as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 10,000 to 20,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. This reflects modest continued declines in Q2 from the roughly 30,000 tests per day we are seeing in April. And some degree of stabilization during the second half of the year. 19:12 As we look toward 2023, our expectation for COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes assumes that the COVID-19 testing run rates in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. 19:27 Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-July. We assume average reimbursements of COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period, while the public health emergency  renewed beyond July, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. 19:47 We remain prepared for additional future surges collecting COVID-19 testing volume from a range of customers. While the PHE is in effect, we continue to incur incremental costs from non-traditional channels for supplies, special logistics  and channel expenses for this volume, which can represent roughly $30 in incremental cost per test. Therefore, you should not assume the higher reimbursement due to the PHE extension drops right to the bottom line. 20:16 As Steve noted earlier, we're already seeing some returns in our investments to accelerate growth, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. And would expect a margin tailwind on these investments in 2023. 20:33 As a reminder, we are planning to spend approximately 160 million on these investments this year. We spent approximately 30 million in the first quarter and are looking for these investments to ramp up in Q2 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IP costs are temporary, but variable marketing costs will increase   launch of the new site. 20:58 We’ll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering, as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. 21:08 Finally, we know there's a lot focus on expectations for 2023. While it’s clearly too early to provide specific guidance for next year based on everything we know and see today, we expect to deliver topline and earnings consistent with our long-term outlook that we provided at our 2021 Investor Day. I’ll now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: 21:30 Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2022 driving strong year-over-year growth in the base business. We continue to make important investments to accelerate growth and we are seeing the results. Now based on the strength of our base business, we've raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: 21:54 Thank you.  Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: 22:12 Good morning. So, a really nice job in the quarter managing cost and improving margins. So, how has the performance in Q1 compared to your expectations? And how should we think about the margin expansion opportunity for the rest of the year from 1Q level? If we look at that as a baseline?
Mark Guinan: 22:33 Yes. Ricky thanks for the question. As you look at the way the quarter played out, Omicron was more severe than we had anticipated, which drove higher COVID revenues, but we also saw the base business impacted by that. So, definitely in January as we mentioned the base business was softer, so relative to our expectations in Q1 more COVID, less base business, but as we exited the quarter and certainly as we talked about in February and March the base business bounced back to our expectations. 23:08 So, while we're very pleased with where we see the base business, growth for the year, it would have been even higher had it not been for Omicron. And the margin is really were what we were expecting. So, we walked through in the last call how some of the margin impacts in Q4 was really temporary around annual incentive plan and some costs related to some special things that we needed to do for COVID testing in that quarter, some over time that we're having in fair amount of  and some things that we really saw as temporary. 23:44 Look  is that once we got the Omicron, those costs, generally did go away and we anticipate further reduction in some of the special expenses related to COVID safety and protection for employees that we continue to advance hopefully and get into the endemic and end of the pandemic. So, I'd say other than the higher COVID revenue and a little lower base in January, generally the  is expected, and that's why we're comfortable raising the bottom and upper end of our guidance at the midpoint.
Steve Rusckowski: 24:15 Just like to reiterate what Mark said about the base business, just underscore that we're pleased with what we saw in Q1. It would have been better, if it didn't have the softness that Mark talked about in January. We remind everyone that we posted about 6.3% growth in our base business, which had only about 100-days’ worth of acquisitions. 24:38 So the organic growth was around five. And again, if January was stronger, it would have been stronger than that. So, we feel good about that to be the start of the year, which gives us confidence for the full-year. So feel bit about the start of the year for our base business. And that gave us the confidence to raise guidance for the full-year beyond COVID.
Mark Guinan: 24:56 One additional comment on that. When you look at the compares, the easiest compare on the basis was Q1. So, to Steve's point, we've credited that even better. We would have done it better than the 6.3 of January not been impacted by Omicron, but as we go through the balance of the year, it compares to get a little tougher because lot the recovery from other pandemic, occurred late in 2020 and early in 2021. So, the growth going forward is more going to be driven by share and less about utilization and the market recovery.
Ricky Goldwasser: 25:35 So, can I just quickly follow-up on that? You talked about the improvement in   with more difficult comps. So, how is demand shaping up in April to date?
Mark Guinan: 25:47 Yes. So, the business continues to perform at a high level as it was happening in Q1. So, it wouldn't be updated in our guidance if we weren't confident that what we saw in terms of the performance early is continued. So, we’re more focused on overall growth as opposed to the percentage year-over-year because obviously the compare makes it complicated. So, we're very happy as we get into April and we see the performance of our base business. And as we mentioned, COVID is kind of stabilized. We're not sure how long that will continue. We certainly took a little bit of a volume hit from the change in HRSA. 26:25 And because there's been a little bit of a spike I'd say some of that was partially offset by the market growing a little bit recently. So that's probably the way you get to a reasonably flat level of COVID testing over the last month.
Ricky Goldwasser: 26:44 Thank you.
Operator: 26:47 Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: 26:51 Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: 26:53 Hey, good morning. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe just another one on the margins. You touched on a little bit there in the first question. Can you just talk about, I guess given the ongoing growth investments, wage inflation, can you just talk about, kind of your thoughts as we work our way through this year and into 2023. Obviously, the PHE extension should help on that front in terms of kind of the margin side. So, again, I guess, when we look at the earnings raise, how should we think about the base margin piece again ex-ASP as we work our way through this year and again into 2023?
Steve Rusckowski: 27:24 Yeah. So, as Mark indicated in his prepared remarks, changing dynamics that are business with investments in the second quarter and then less COVID in the back half of the year and what we indicated we will be coming out of the year in the back half with – the amount of COVID testing we would expect, there's a good level to think about in 2023. 27:49 And so what we also expect is to continue to get the investment returns that we expect in advanced diagnostics and in consumer testing, starting in the back half, and again, what Mark said in his prepared remarks, and we believe that investment return will be a tailwind for us in 2023. So, this is a transitional year with those investments. Transitional year for COVID, and Mark you like to give a little perspective on Q2 and then the back half?
Mark Guinan: 28:22 Yes. And I’ll try to answer your questions Patrick. So, on inflation, we talked about building in an extra 100 basis points or so in our wages costs. And that was in our original guidance. And through 3.5 months of the year we haven't seen anything that suggests that wasn't a reasonable assumption. So, basically, inflation was about where we’re expecting. And I'd say, our non-wage items, such as materials and supplies and so on, surely fuel costs have been bouncing around, but nothing has deviated significantly from our critical assumptions coming into the year around inflation. 29:03 The PHE is significant revenue and from a dollar margin perspective, it certainly is helpful, but from a percentage margin and perspective, I want to be clear that it's not significantly higher than the post PHE world because those costs go away that reference, that are more than $30. So, the people are focused on percentage margins, the base is not a big change in terms of what you will see. 29:03 And I guess the important thing is that as the base volume grows, we've always shared that incremental organic growth in the base business as a very high level of drop through. So, the other margin consideration as we grow as we expected and as we've signaled in our guidance, that that will help drive margin expansion. And then finally, just a reminder that we are in a much better place in price than we've been historically. And so, therefore, a lot of the  productivity savings that in the past help pay for inflation,  inflation is a little bit worse. Certainly the pricing environment is better. So, there's more of that to cover that inflation and also to drive bottom line margin expansion.
Steve Rusckowski: 30:16 So remember too as you think about, as we transition for the year, and Ricky asked about April. We have higher level testing in April going on. We do periodically update you on that. And that number we expect in our guidance to come down. And as we indicated as we come out of 2022, we'll be running around 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day. And we're assuming that the PHE will expire because we didn’t know nothing beyond what we've heard so far, which will add sometime in July. 30:51 So, as you think about that transition, and then think about the investments we're making and thinking about the nice momentum we're building in the base business it gives you some perspective of how we're going to come through the three remaining quarters of this year, and then guide us to a reasonable place to be able to deliver what Mark indicated for 2023.
Patrick Donnelly: 31:15 Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the balance sheet, cash flow obviously has been pretty strong for the past few quarters here, capital allocation is in focus for investors, can you just talk about your priorities there? What the M&A pipeline looks like, what the funnel looks like? And then maybe compare that to kind of the share repo opportunities?
Mark Guinan : 31:35 Sure. So, our capital priorities haven't changed. We have that commitment return majority of free cash flow as we shared, you know normal times we get pretty close with the dividend and we do some share repurchases to offset dilution, obviously with the COVID  cash generation, and we've had the inability to deploy more cash. We always preferred to do M&A because we've got very high standards around the deals that we executed. So, would always be the preference, but at given point in time, given our strong cash from the balance sheet and our ability to generate cash, we're not going to sit on it. 32:13 So, the 350 million in the first quarter is more of a reflection of how much cash we had at year-end and the fact that we didn’t do a transaction in Q1 as opposed any change in priority. So, Steve, would you want to comment on the pipeline?
Steve Rusckowski: 32:29 Yes. Yes. So, we feel good about again, our commitment of 2% growth through acquisitions. As you know, we've delivered that consistently. We feel good about our ability to – on a routine basis to deliver the consolidation strategy we've been executing against. We've got a few step we are working on and we still feel that we will be able to get to a number close to that 2% in 2022. So, as I have said in the first quarter, we're lighter than that. This is lumpy, but we do expect that we'll be moving on a few in the second quarter and into the third quarter to deliver what we expect.
Patrick Donnelly: 33:09 Great. Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: 33:10 Operator, next question.
Operator: 33:11 Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: 33:16 Good morning, A.J.
A.J. Rice: 33:19 Hi, everybody. Obviously, the value based arrangements are becoming more significant as you described in your prepared remarks. I wondered if we could get you to step back and talk about a few of the key features of these arrangements and discuss how they allow Quest to do better economically? It sounds like you think you can do better economically under these types of arrangements. And I know you referred to pricing being better. We used to always think a managed care pricing is being a 1% to 2% negative headwind each year, has that dynamic changed and is it mainly because of these value based arrangements?
Steve Rusckowski: 33:56 Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Mark and Jim to kind of add to this. As we have said in our strategy here and health plan access change there is a big opportunity for us, number one. Number two is, we do plan that gaining share. And number three, we are gaining shares. So, our health plan revenues are growing faster than overall revenues and we believe growing faster in the markets. So, we're making progress. So, in that regard, the second question is the environment has gotten better. 34:29 We've indicated in prior calls and prior quarters, and it's proven to be true as we go throughout this year. As we get into renegotiations with the plans, we believe we have stronger position to negotiate and in some cases, modest prices because we're delivering more and more value. Our quality is improving, service performance is better, and we have an opportunity to help them narrow the network and narrow the number of providers they have with the number of these programs. 34:59 So, it has gotten better and we indicated that less than 100 basis points overall. I'll remind you that when we talk about price, there's a lot of focus around the plans, but we have price pressures in the hospital business and our client build business, but at least on the health plan side, it has gotten better and we have gotten modest increases for some of the contract renewals that we've had. 35:21 In terms of value-based contracting, the biggest opportunity we have, which you indicated in the past is around United. And United is a very different relationship for us and what we had years ago. It is clearly a relationship that we're working different aspects to be able to pick up share. And as part of that, now it's indicated in my remarks, we do have shared savings opportunities and we have opportunities together to do a better job with their membership than their clients. And then beyond United, we have extended that thinking to other parts of our health plant portfolio with other concepts, they’re not all identical. But they have similar characteristics in general where we have better alignment between what they're trying to accomplish and what we're trying to accomplish. 36:13 In the end, we’re all trying to achieve what's been described as the  , which is better quality, better experience, at lower cost, and that's resonating very well in the marketplace. Overall, as you know, this is an entirely focused organizations on that  plan for the greater delivery systems as well. So, Mark you like to add something to…
Jim Davis: 36:37 Yes. So, A.J., personally we think about value based care and arrangements. This is not necessarily being . So, this is being indicated with both United Healthcare  many of these value based care incentives come to us through performance on leakage agreements where they provide us list of physicians that are using how to connect for   and what we move that for, there's a value base, there's an incentive for Quest. 37:07 We proactively work with both payers on moving work out of extensive health system laboratories. If selective  list of physicians that are using that those labs and we go after it. Finally, we worked hand in hand with both of those plans and others on approaching employers and getting employers to see the benefits of steering their employees to the independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. 37:34 When we do enter into these capitated arrangements, I can assure you going forward, we're going to have a much greater stake in what we call the clinical pathways that are used by physicians to ensure that utilization makes sense for the clinical condition that the physician diagnosed.
Mark Guinan: 37:55 Yeah. The only thing I'll add, A.J. is, there’s elements in those contracts, that Jim just described. The one I'll add is also  we've talked about in the past, when we do an acquisition of hospital outreach, and instead of the rates immediately dropping to our rates, there's a step down a majority of our large contracts right now. So, we kind to share the value of movement network through an acquisitions, which aligned our incentives and really the greatest value is, is it moves the conversation around away from price being the way they create value and more towards  which Jim talked about and partnering and working together to get connections of work to  better price, but also there's things that come with it that benefit the patients, the physicians, it's our tools and our technology, it's our quality. 38:50 I mean, you know that in the  , it's not about the price, it's really about a couple of the metrics around quality and tools and I mean what is their experience in the patient drop center to how we feed the data to the payer and the frequency in quality. So, there’s a lot beyond price that determines  space and that's where we've been successful in moving the conversation. 39:16 And yes, then within the contracts themselves, there will be shared savings and these other value driven parameters that can get us a better price or more value as we demonstrate to them where we’re creating value for them as well.
A.J. Rice: 39:31 Alright, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: 39:34 Our question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: 39:39 Good morning, Pito.
Pito Chickering: 39:40 Very good morning, guys.   my questions. Back to the guidance question, previously, it didn't assume any share repo besides offsetting dilution, what does your current guidance assume? Back into net income guidance, you know from the previous guidance using 124 million diluted shares in fourth quarter, versus the current guidance at 121 million shares backing into the midpoint range and net income, essentially flat despite revenues up $200 million or at the low-end. So, it’s got us into a margin compression of about 10 basis points. So, a long way of saying, is margin guidance down today versus previous guidance and any ?
Mark Guinan: 40:21 Yes. At this point, the share repurchases is definitely done pretty much offset our equity programs. So, it's not there's a huge decline in waste so based on what we've done. And in terms of going forward, it'd be dependent on M&A opportunities versus buybacks. So, there's no material change in our way so contemplated in our guidance so it is to what we gave back to .
Steve Rusckowski: 40:52 And as you see in our results,   Q1 with about $700 million worth of cash. And obviously, we're going to put that to use to a good way. We're looking at acquisitions as we talked about. And we'll handle that in due course throughout the remainder of the year.
Pito Chickering: 41:17 I think just as you drill into that, you know backing into previous guidance as your current guidance with the share counts you had before versus current share counts, I get to net income of about $1.1 billion for both the current Quest, the current guidance versus previous guidance, despite revenues going up, is that the right math? Does that would imply margin impression about 10 basis points?
Mark Guinan: 41:38 Yes. So, I would not want to take away an implication of margin compression Pito. And remember that we don't do point estimates. We do ranges. So, there's a lot of moving parts, everything from topline mix, clinical mix, exactly, precisely, how much COVID testing we get going forward. And share obviously deployment of cash. 42:04 So that's why we give a range. So, we feel very good about the margins. We would expect that the margins would improve on the base business going forward. Certainly, the COVID elements and everything from the PHE to the volume we have could impact margins as well. 42:21 I’ll give you one example if you're looking at income margin, certainly some of the JVs where specifically some of our Quest where they have done a lot of COVID testing, we have no revenue, but we get their earnings contribution from that. So, there's a lot of things that they kind of skew margins, but I think what people really want to understand is the base business. 42:41 So, what’s going to happen going into 2023? We're very comfortable with the base business, we’ll be at or above pre-pandemic levels and we'll have a larger base business in 2023 with some level of COVID testing and in the margin performance that you saw in Q1, we're not expecting it to erode, even despite the factor, we did talk about raising up some of our CIT investments in Q2. So, it's also been contemplated, it’s all in that range of guidance and so it’s kind of hard to pin down specific margin at this point, but it's not bad news.
Pito Chickering: 43:16 Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: 43:19 Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: 43:25 Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Caliendo: 43:28 Good morning. Want to follow-up on the guidance question just a little bit, so you'd beat in the quarter by roughly $0.25 and you raised your COVID revenues by 150 or so, which depending on what margin you use could almost equate to that same sort of $0.25, was the guidance range, was the guidance range raise related to the first quarter beat? Was it related to the COVID increases there an overlap there? How should we think about that?
Mark Guinan: 43:58 So, the guidance range was related to the totality of the business. And again, if you look at Q1 as we shared, the base business was  extremely well. Didn’t do as well as we expected when we entered the year because of Omicron. 44:15 So, some of the raise in COVID for the year and the performance in Q1 was really offsetting a slightly softer base business. Now, the good news is that the base business came back. So that softness in the base business was temporary. The other dynamic is that, we do have the PHE being extended and we also have this change in HRSA, which is not insignificant. So, we mentioned there was over $20 million of loss opportunity that will get paid for the uninsured from more than we did in late March. 44:49 So, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and so it's really hard to parse precisely what is driving the rate, it's really our greater confidence in the business performance for the year in totality with all of those pieces. And so again, well a lot people focus as they rightly understood on the midpoint, I'd say just in general business is in better shape and in total than we would have expected 90 days ago and that's why we're comfortable raising both the topline in the bottom line.
Steve Rusckowski: 45:20 Yes. As we enter the year, what we indicated for COVID is around 700 to 1 billion and obviously we're delivering 600 million in the first quarter. We have more certainty around what is left within that initial guidance. 45:37 Obviously going into the year, there's a lot of uncertainty of what would happen now,  how fast would decline, and how each testing would go on in the back half of the first quarter. So, the timing up of the range, the asset range is hit by this, as Mark indicated there’s puts and takes of this in terms of the impact on our bottom line. But I'll just reiterate, we feel good about our start with our based business and we're tracking well for a strong year based on our initial guidance.
Kevin Caliendo: 46:11 Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the 160 million in investments. You said part of it would be temporary, part of it would be permanent. I think one of the things we're all trying to figure out here is, sort of what the base margins look like in a non-COVID or a COVID would  flat year-over-year or whatever, which seems like we're moving into, what the base margins normalize would look like? So, if we think about how much might linger, any help on that? And maybe the question would be, what do you think base margins look like in 2023 or exiting when COVID becomes endemic versus where they were in 2019? Like, is it possible that those base margins are higher going forward? That you guys have figured out a way to be more productive ?
Steve Rusckowski: 47:02 Remember, we're vesting $160 million, we’re vesting   sixty million because we have a strong business piece to get the returns. So, what we had indicated, we are ahead of our plan to get the returns in advanced diagnostics and we feel bullish about the opportunities of the consumer. And the results on both of those fronts have been good news. And so, when we talk about the second part that you mentioned of putting in place a new platform, also where a consumer business we're investing in some marketing to get the growth we expect, and we are getting the results so far and we'll continue to see the results in the back half of the year. 47:43 What we also said is that as we come out of 2022 into 2023, when you think about a year-on-year compare, with the returns we expect from Advanced Diagnostics and the returns we expect from the consumer, that a year-on-year improvement in those businesses will be tailwinds for our margins in 2023. 48:10 So, again, we're investing to grow, we're investing to get a return. We feel good about getting those returns actually quicker than expected, and next year, the year-on-year compare related to that 160 million will be a net tailwind for us in terms of our earnings in 2023. Mark anything you like to add?
Mark Guinan: 48:31 Yes. So, just a reminder that we shared a view that we could  business to   by 2025. And remember, especially if you strip out the COVID testing revenue this was a business that was small millions, not that long ago. So, very significant growth projected in this business and we’re still very comfortable and confident. We just talked about the performance in this past quarter and we don't have our new customer experience IT capability that we think is really going to make a difference in terms of the ease and use of that site. 49:09 So, as Steve said, we’ll create tailwinds because we'll be investing less relative to the revenue. But in terms of the margin, what I'd say is, on the business ex-consumer, the margins will be as good or better than you're used to talking about pre-pandemic. But we will have a sizable consumer business that is still an investment mode because we're still looking to grow. So, the overall enterprise margin you should not expect to be expanded. The good news is, we would expect stronger growth. 49:44 And as for some reason that consumer business doesn't deliver and we can turn off the marketing expense. So, it's not as if we’re adding tons of people or infrastructure or costs. So, we’re very confident in our ability to grow that business. We want to invest to optimize that growth for a period of time, it is going to improve its bottom line next year relative to this year and then certainly over the years beyond that, we would expect to have a nice healthy margin on that business as well. And it will be quite sizeable.
Steve Rusckowski: 50:15 And as Mark said, as we go through thinking by the way, we indicated in our Investor Day, and we're not going to give you 2023 guidance, so Mark indicated is when we think about 2023, we're still believing we're comfortably in the range we would expect in 2023 in terms of EPS in growth. And the second half sets its up nicely and what we've implied in our guidance for the full-year implies a set-up, so we would be able to deliver what Mark indicated in 2023 and a view that we indicated in our Investor Day in spring of 2021. 50:57 So, we're consistent and we believe we're on track to delivering what we expect and what you would expect in 2022 and 2023.
Kevin Caliendo: 51:07 Thank you for all that detail.
Steve Rusckowski: 51:09 Thanks.
Operator: 51:11 Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from  . Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: 51:15 Hey, Jack.
Steve Rusckowski: 51:15 Hey, Jack.
Jack Meehan: 51:17 Hello, and happy to say, Nephron Research. So, Steve, on 2023, I know still premature to give a specific number, but at the Analyst Day, you talked about 7% to 9% earnings growth, kind of off of an $8 number you were gearing us to at that point? Now, talking about some tale of COVID here too, can you just like make sure we're doing the math right? Can we take 8% grow it, add some COVID on top? There's obviously some other moving parts, but is that the right way to think about it or where am I wrong?
Steve Rusckowski: 51:57 We're going to refresh all of your memories of what we said in  through.
Mark Guinan: 52:02 Yes. So at that point, we said $7.40 to $8 and then 7% to 9% CAGR from 2022 and beyond. And then as we got further along past Investor Day we started to signal that we would expect it would be closer to the $8 or on the upper end of the range and because 2022 has more COVID revenue, I would just remind everybody, the growth rate in 2023 is going to be below that CAGR, but the absolute number we're saying should still be where you would have calculated it back in March of 2021. So, just happens to be that the pandemic hung around for a little bit longer. 52:47 I also mentioned at Investor Day that we did not assume COVID would go away. So, in that outlook, I had a level kind of a sustained COVID testing, we do expect that COVID testing will be around part of our portfolio. And certainly nowhere here the levels of 2020 and 2021 or even what we're projecting this year, but not insignificant. So, I did not take COVID as upside for that. We certainly have some COVID built into that outlook.
Steve Rusckowski: 53:13 Yeah, what we said, remember this is the spring of 2021. We expected 2022 to be able to grow that we indicated both topline to bottom line, but we also said and it continues to this day, we expect that COVID will continue to be part of our portfolio of tests going forward. 53:35 So that was 2021, thinking about 2022 the same is true for 2022 going into 2023. So, we're going to come out of 2022 with some COVID testing. You see the volumes we indicate, which is about 10,000 and 15,000 per day. Obviously, we're assuming right now we're a lower price, we will continue to have COVID testing in 2023 and we’ve always assumed in our outlook going forward for growth in the topline and bottom line will be COVID testing  portfolio. 54:04 And frankly, we think it's a good opportunity. Because if you go through the math, even at lower price points, this is a sizable market and we have a good size share right now. We think there’s dynamics to the marketplace and we're working on plans to actually gain share in the COVID testing marketplace that could be with us for the foreseeable future.
Jack Meehan: 54:25 Great. As a follow-up, wanted to ask you about the consumer directed testing. You talked about the growth rate; how much revenue did that area generate in the quarter? And can you also talk about interest beyond COVID? Is there any specific areas of menu that you're targeting or you think are resonating and where that investments getting directed?
Steve Rusckowski: 54:48 Well, first of all, Jeff, we like to give you specific numbers for the quarter. What we share with you, it grew nicely double-digits on both the base business as well as on COVID. Jim, why don’t you talk about the portfolio and what we're seeing growth in?
Jim Davis : 55:00 Yes. So, Jack, we've talked into the past, there's various segments since consumer initiated testing business. I'll touch on two. One is, we call them watchful warriors, people that have product conditions like diabetes, like cancer, but their insurance company they only pay for, let's just say two A1c test a year and these people worry about the disease that they may come in once the  and get testing. So, it just makes more sense that they do it through us directly rather than have to go to a physician office pay an expensive bill just to get an A1c test. 55:38 So, there's a lot of demand from these types of patients. The second is, we’ve talked about . People who don't want their insurance company to know they are getting tested, they may not want their doctor to know, they may not want their spouse, they may not want their mother or father, you know, some of this is in relation to STD testing. So, it is a big segment for people that value privacy. 56:05 Finally, there's a generation, a much younger generation that may not want to go to the doctor. They don't have a doctor, but they may want to get lab testing done once a year just to check the underlying health of their body. And so, call it the 20 to 26 year old segment that they don't have primary care physicians, but they are concerned about their health. And they come in and get these once a year comprehensive  for overall health. 56:35 There's other areas as well Jack, physical fitness offset, check one more level before marathons and things like that, but those are the primary ones.
Mark Guinan: 56:44 Yes. Jack, we've talked about this previously. We moved this – what we call blueprint for wellness, which was an offering we gave to employers. It is a battery of diagnostic testing that gives you a good blueprint for how your  and other important metrics. And we're actually offering that now on  testing and people really find that interesting. So, an opportunity to get a full run of diagnostic testing like people have gotten who had employers  we do it for our own employee base and it can be very, very valuable. 57:24 And then obviously if there's anything that’s out of range than go to the doctor. Instead of going to doctor first to get the script.
Steve Rusckowski: 57:31 Yeah. As Mark said, to, it's a small business particularly on the base business and that number is growing strong double-digits. And what we said is, we're committed to the business dealing of about $250 million in size by 2025. Well, needless to say with the investment that we're making, the new leadership we brought in that Jim indicated and really a very focused organizational model that we have in place. 58:04 We're getting good traction and we believe you're going to start to see acceleration of the revenues we get from it, which should be a net tailwind for us for our growth overall as we go into 2023 and beyond tracking to that $250 million number in  . 58:23 If you just kind of go through the math, you can see this is going to be accretive to our growth in 2023 and 2024 beyond what we've seen so far because the numbers get much more substantial year-on-year to give us a nice lift in our growth rate going forward.
Shawn Bevec: 58:39 Operator, next question.
Operator: 58:42 Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: 58:47 Hey, good morning guys. Good morning. Just one question. Mark, I know you don't give quarterly guidance and you've given us some color for the guidance for the year, but just any considerations we need to be thinking about as it relates to Q2? And then maybe just on that $30 cost, you mentioned that goes away related – as COVID volumes go down per test? How quickly does that go away? I'm guessing some of that's payroll and headcount. So, just curious like how does that  function progress over the course of the year, in terms of like eliminating that $30 number?
Mark Guinan: 59:23 Yes. So, that payroll is actually a fee we pay to a partner and that relationship that we have is only permissible during the PHE. So there's absolutely guarantee that when PHE goes away that that payment goes away. So, it's directly 100% correlated to that in addition to some other costs, I mentioned like logistics and so on and so forth. But obviously if we stopped a relationship and stopped the payment, we don't have the logistics cost as well because we're not making those special runs to areas that normally we wouldn't go to pick up specimens. 60:02 So, I think you probably have other pieces Brian, go through it. So, we've talked about a level of testing that’s been averaging about 30,000 here early in the quarter, we talked about a lower level in the second half. So that's one consideration for COVID, you know the PHE is due to the full second quarter. Certainly that's much more of a revenue impact and dollar margin versus percentage margin. 60:29 A change from Q2 to the back half of the year. And then most importantly, we're back to growth mode and every week, every quarter, gives an opportunity to go out and do what we're doing before the pandemic, win over more work with offices grow organically, and all of that will benefit the back half relative to where we were in Q1 and certainly expect to be in Q2. So, COVID rent continue to ramp down, the base business continued to grow, PHE  at least that’s in our guidance, but then also importantly that those incremental costs with the COVID testing will go away with the PHE ending.
Steve Rusckowski: 61:09 And then just to remind you, what we have told you is this $160 million that we’re investing, we said, we spent about 30 so far. And what we said is in Q2, we've got some investments we're making, particularly we’re releasing a new platform. Okay? So, think about that, someone of this is period expense, it's one-off, okay, but some of this is repeatable that we will see in the back half of the year. 61:34 So some headwinds in the second quarter will be with us. The best that we continue to make, we think in a real great opportunity for us to grow long-term. So, think about that as well. And think about the timing of what will happen when throughout the remainder of the year.
Brian Tanquilut: 61:52 Appreciate that. Thank you, guys.
Operator: 61:55 Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: 62:00 Thank you and good morning. So I want – couple of questions on advanced diagnostic testing. First of all, one of the other public labs that does the oncology testing, talked about weaker volumes, so we're coming out of the pandemic. Could you talk about what you have sort of seen in oncology testing through that market and are you gaining share there? And then as a follow-up to that, your other main competitor has been doing a number of acquisitions and things like with biopsy and the other ones, how are you sort of thinking about building out your pipeline for the advanced market,  booking for potential acquisitions feel better area to enhance or is it all  ? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: 62:46 Absolutely. So, we shared with you strategically what we're doing, okay. Last year, we indicated that our business and our definition of advanced diagnostics is entirely defined around genetics and molecular. In last year, excluding COVID because that is molecular. It was about $1.3 billion in size. Number one. 63:09 Number two is, what we have done is, we have focused on four areas that have indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're putting additional investments in and that – and those investment dollars are throughout the entire value chain. It's investment upfront and you test in organic convention. It's also in our experience that we work with our physicians and the patients that they serve and that's also around the services that we have to provide, which is not a counseling and with our sales force to be able to have better reach within the markets that we serve. 63:47 So, it's through the full value chain. And what we have been running at historically is to grow 3% to 4% growth in that business. So, what we said in our 2021 Investor Day is we're going to accelerate growth that we’re going to get to high single digits and we indicated today that we're making good progress against that number is about 8%, okay? 64:10 Now in that, majority of the assumption is we're doing that organically with the investments we're making. However, as you know in the past, we paid some selective acquisitions, quick one, particularly Blueprint genetics, which gives us some bioinformatics capability that enhances our capability around genetics. 64:32 And what we indicated last year is that strategy is working. Those areas of growth, okay are growing strong double-digits, and that strong double digits in 2021 versus 2020 and also in 2021 versus 2019 at pre-pandemic levels. So, we feel our organic strategy of investing is working out and then trying with our share is we continue to look at acquisitions that would make sense to enhance our portfolio, but remember we've been very disciplined about doing acquisitions. 65:08 We have very tight criteria for acquisitions where they have to be accretive to our earnings in a reasonable period time, they have to be accretive to our belief around our earnings opportunities around  . They have to be accretive to our growth and therefore when we look at, it's actually buying things versus investing or investing in ourselves, we’re always considering the trade-off of how we continue to build value. 65:35 So, that's been our strategy and our strategy we've put in place is working, it’s ahead of schedule and we feel good about it going forward. Jim, maybe you would like to add to that?
Jim Davis: 65:44 Yes, Derik you asked about our oncology performance. And when we think about our oncology business it is hard to say a solid tumor  holding to that basic pathology work that then fold off  needed. That business is doing well. And has recovered from 2019 levels. And then there's a core hematology business, which has always been a real, real strength of Quest Diagnostics and that business continues to expand. 66:12 So, our oncology portfolio is in good shape. You mentioned liquid biopsy, there certainly is a market and what we referred to is the MRD side that’s Minimal Residual Disease side. We're working on an assay that’s also commercially available assays from our suppliers and we’re considering both. 66:37 In terms of pre-cancer or cancer spring assays, that's a bit more out there. Something we watch as you know, there's 63, 65 start-up companies with the name liquid biopsy that received a   of venture capital money last year. And we're certainly keeping an eye in the space on the space as Steve indicated. If we find one that meets all of our criteria, we’ll look closely at it.
Operator: 67:07 Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: 67:14 Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: 67:15 Hi, good morning. So, one more margin question. I think the issue is, maybe we are over estimating the margins on COVID back into your big base business, and you refer to your partner, which I'm assuming is CVS that you have to pay that $30 fee, can you tell us what percentage of your test is CVS. So, just to make sure that we are estimating, just kind of the consolidated margin for COVID quickly?
Mark Guinan: 67:44 So, when we talk about non-traditional channels, it's not limited to one partner. And what I can share is that it grew before the person changed to where and it was almost up to half of our volume that was coming from the non-traditional channels and a higher proportion of the traditional volumes was uninsured. 68:15 And since the uninsured volumes have dropped off that proportion has dropped off as well as we go, but it’s still significant. And I would not want to comment specifically on any partner and certainly the one you mentioned is not our only partner.
Jim Davis: 68:35 Yes. And the range, the percent in our volume that comes through these retail partners actually varies. During searches, I would say it's less – it reduces because we start to then get a lot of specimens from physician offices, urgent care centers, and hospitals. When COVID subsides then that becomes slightly larger percentage of our mix.
Mark Guinan: 69:02 Right. There are  , we can do less cooling and we can take a little bit of a hit on the turnaround time, $25 that is in a lot of the contracts and certainly in CMS’ payments. So, there's a lot of dynamics that can offset each other. And that's why we really  focus people that we can make a reasonable margin on the CMS reimbursement grade on COVID going forward, and it's not the price change will all drop to the bottom line.
Steve Rusckowski: 69:34 Going back to what's in our numbers and what’s based and what's COVID, I'll keep on really reiterating. Remember, we took advantage of the opportunity we had in 2020 and 2021 to invest in accelerating growth. And those investments take time and they're ahead of schedule and that's going to help us next year, year-on-year. So, think about that too as it kind of goes through the plan for this year into next.
Operator: 70:05 Our final question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Rachel Vatnsdal: 70:11 Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, could you just elaborate on the POS contract momentum that you've been seeing, especially  return normal, how should we think about the cadence of those wins and revenue contributions for this year?
Steve Rusckowski: 70:24 Yes. So, I mentioned in our prepared remarks  that we've announced and our relationships are strong and beginning to demonstrate that we can bring real value to these  delivery systems. Remind you all what it is, is, one is, yes, we help them run there labs and we see what you see one, but they save money and provide household systems are struggling as you know. 70:55 Volumes, yes, in some cases of recoveries like the acuity level of patients and the beds, are higher and they have fixed reimbursement. And then secondly, as they are having inflationary pressure in hospital systems, which has been tougher that to offset. So, that's the first piece. Second is, when we have our relationship, our advanced diagnostics business in our overall sophisticated testing business, which we call reference testing with hospitals also is an opportunity, so we typically bring in a larger share of that with hospitals. 71:29 And then finally, we have an opportunity in some cases to buy their offerings business, which has been nice opportunity for us to build value, which helps us sort of the acquisition target, but also helps us because eventually they are accretive because we know  is quite well. So, it's worked. right? Yes. And going forward the funnel continues to build. We have a dedicated team. We've invested in that as well. Jim and I are entirely engaged together. 71:56 Working a large number of these accounts. We personally do a fair amount of travel and spend time with the management team, engaged in these opportunities. So, we do believe it continues to yield us a nice opportunity going forward to continue to accelerate growth. So, Jim, anything you like to add to that?
Jim Davis: 72:15 I would say that, funnel of opportunities  time negotiate. Obviously,  someone different your helps system laboratory during COVID is that something helps us  trying to. Now that COVID is subsiding, helps us  patients is under control. I think you'll see the deal actually pick-up.
Steve Rusckowski: 72:48 Okay, great. So thanks again for joining our call. We appreciate your continued support and you all have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. At the request of this company, the call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation, and the question-and-answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics, with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without written consent, of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.  Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. 
Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer and Jim Davis, our Executive Vice President, General Diagnostics and Chief Executive Officer-Elect. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Over the past two years, our 50,000 quest employees have risen to the challenge of COVID-19, innovating, persevering, and remaining committed to the patients and customers we serve. While doing so, they also grew our base business by more than 19% in 2021, achieving record levels. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished as a team. So we have a lot of news to cover this morning. And I want to get into that so we can have your questions. So let's get started.  So first, I'll start by sharing some color on the leadership transition we've announced this morning. Then we'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. And then finally Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial outlook for 2022.  So as you have seen, in our announcement this morning, we've begun implementing a gradual leadership succession plan, under which Jim Davis, Executive Vice President of General Diagnostics will succeed me to become Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2022. At that time, I will continue to serve on the Quest Board of Directors as Executive Chairman.  Quest Diagnostics is a great company that is well-positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value. As I approached a decade in the role, the Board and I determined that now is the right time to begin to turn over the helm to a new leader. Jim Davis is extremely well qualified to be CEO, having managed a large part of this company in his role as Executive Vice President. He has deep knowledge of Quest, the healthcare industry and the corporate world, gained through more than 35 years of business experience. Jim is widely respected and will be a strong CEO. When I took this role nearly 10 years ago, Quest was not growing, nor realizing its potential. We launched a new strategy, our new Quest to drive transformational change. To drive that change, we built a new leadership team, and Jim has been a key member of that team. We built a business strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. To drive growth, we focused on improving relationships with health plans, hospital health systems, and expanding fast growing businesses, and advanced diagnostics, and consumer testing.  In addition, we've added about 2% revenue growth on average through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions over the last several years. We have driven operational excellence, and our Invigorate program has consistently improved quality and customer experience, while generating 3% productivity each year. And we've made more inclusive by increasing the diversity on our Board, and amongst our management ranks.  Finally, we established Quest for Health Equity in 2020, over $100 million committed to reduce healthcare disparities among underserved in the United States, particularly communities of color. I am very proud of what we've accomplished together. And if you consider the opportunities in front of us, in many ways, we're just getting started.  We have a strong team and Jim as a key leader in our transformation. He runs our General Diagnostics business, which accounts for more than 80% of revenues and three quarters of our employees. He manages operations, including sales and marketing, patient services, logistics, laboratories, billing and customer services. He also oversees the Drive Operational Excellence strategy, which includes our Invigorate program. He has provided enterprise oversight for pandemic response. And if that wasn't enough, he's also lead the development of Quest ESG strategy.  So Jim, congratulations. I look forward to working very closely with you through this transition. 
James E. Davis : Hey, thanks Steve, and I really look forward to working closely with you over the next eight months, and ensuring a very successful transition. It's a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to succeed you in Quest and lead Quest into the next stage of our growth. We have a very powerful vision in Quest of empowering better health and diagnostic insights.  Our business strategy is straightforward and well understood. And our company has never been more central to patients and to the health care system, as we've seen during this pandemic. I really look forward to working with the management team and all 50,000 employees to build on the strong foundation that Quest has put in place. Quest's future is really bright. And we're extremely well positioned to continue to create value for shareholders, and all that we serve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Jim. Now at the same time Mark is planning to retire this year. Mark has been in his role for more than eight years, and helped navigate us to the strong position where it is today. We have begun a process in which I will be working closely with Jim to identify Quest's new CFO, and Mark will participate in the selection process. He will remain in the role through the transition.  Mark, I want to thank you for your many contributions, your partnership and your friendship. You've been a key member of our leadership team and we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. 
Mark Guinan : Thanks, Dave. I appreciate the kind words. I just want to take a minute to say that I'm proud to be part of an important company that makes a positive contribution to the country, and I've enjoyed being part of it. Now it's time for me to step back and retire. I'm looking forward to participating in the process to identify my successor who can support Steve and Jim in Quest's next phase of growth. 
Steve Rusckowski: Now turning to our results, we closed out 2021 with another record year of revenue, earnings and cash from operations. Our base business recovered throughout the year, and we experienced strong demand for COVID-19 testing services. So for the full year 2021, total revenues grew by more than 14% to $10.8 billion.  Earnings per share increased by nearly 49% on a reported basis to $15.55, and more than 27% on an adjusted basis to $14.24. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 11% to $2.2 billion. And for the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of roughly 9% versus 2020 when COVID-19 volumes were surging. Earnings per share were $3.12 on a reported basis, and $3.33 on an adjusted basis, both down approximately 26% versus the prior year.  So I'd like to share some perspective on the role of COVID-19 testing going forward. A lot of progress has been made in the battle against COVID-19. But we believe it isn't going away anytime soon. Our molecular product began this year strong, with volumes peaking in January. Testing will continue to play an important part of managing COVID-19, and we believe that molecular testing remains the gold standard. We continued to perform well throughout the surge, maintaining average turnaround times of two days or less for COVID molecular testing.  We will continue to maintain appropriate testing capacities and staffing levels to be prepared for any additional surges throughout this year if they emerge. We also continue to believe there will be a bigger role for serology testing, and how we measure COVID-19 protection going forward. Ultimately we expect COVID-19 testing to eventually more flu-like and become a permanent part of our portfolio going forward.  Now turning to our base business, we continue to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, while we delivered 2% revenue growth on our base business from acquisitions again last year. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the assets of Labtech Diagnostics, a regional independent laboratory, serving physicians and patients primarily in South and North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. This is the first full service laboratory owned by Quest in South Carolina.  We also recently announced our acquisition of Pack Health, a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes. This acquisition will bolster our extended care capabilities. Since 2012, we have completed more than 40 acquisitions, including outreach laboratories, regional independent laboratories and capability enhancing deals. And over the last four years, we've achieved our target of greater than the average of 2% revenue growth on our base business each year from acquisitions.  And then finally, our M&A appetite  remains strong. In 2021, we took full advantage of our strong health plan access, which is approximately 90% of all commercial insurer advice in this country. We also made good progress working together with our plans to help companies and their employees save money by reducing denials and out of network leakage. Our clients also recognize the value of working with us and we have grown our health plan revenues faster than our overall revenues to the best level we've ever seen.  Hospital health system revenues have grown more than 20% compared to 2019 levels, excluding COVID-19 testing, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contract. Our performance in 2021 benefited from our two largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether our PLS business without COVID-19 exceeded a record $500 million in annual revenue last year. Hospitals continuously faced pressure throughout the pandemic. Post-pandemic we believe the same will be true.  We believe there will be a continued consolidation and ongoing challenges that afford Quest an opportunity to implement our flexible solutions that help hospitals become more effective and productive. Advanced diagnostics is critical to the future of healthcare. We're building strong momentum in our key growth drivers, which include consumer and hereditary genetics, oncology and pharma services. In 2021 these test categories accounted for several 100 million dollars of advanced diagnostics portfolio, and they are growing more than 25% versus 2020, and nearly 33% versus 2019.  We are investing aggressively in areas with potential for future differentiation to grow our advanced diagnostics value proposition, including automatic tests, next gen sequencing, bioinformatics, the sales force and customer service. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to give patients and fighters greater access to important innovations such as liquid biopsy, and digital pathology. Advanced diagnostics is one of the fastest growing areas of our portfolio. Our strategy and investments in this area will enable us to achieve high single digit revenue growth going forward.  Now we're equally excited about the opportunities we see in our direct-to-consumer test vertical. Revenues for QuestDirect services nearly doubled to more than $70 million in 2021, driven by both the base business growing and COVID-19 testing. We expect that non-COVID consumer diagnostic market will experience double digit growth over the next several years. And we're on track to build a $250 million direct-to-consumer business by 2025. We're ramping up our investments in to business, launching a new improved digital experience later this year. And we're also investing in enhancements to the in-person customer experience at our patient service centers.  So lots of good stuff in 2022. We're building on our long term relationships with Walmart by recently launching a consumer initiated laboratory testing on walmart.com, through our solution powered by QuestDirect. And the MyQuest platform now has nearly 23 million users, up more than 3 million in the past quarter. We are very excited about our longer term growth opportunities in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing and our increasing investments we made in 2021 to strengthen our business and accelerate growth beyond the pandemic.  These investments were made possible with the record cash and earnings we generated over the past two years. We shared part of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain laser focused on improving both operation quality and efficiency which go hand in hand. Through 2021 the Invigorate program exceeded our goal of 3% productivity improvement. We made good progress last year in procurement supply savings as well as reducing unplanned denials, and improving patient collections at the time of service.  While we faced modest inflationary wage pressure in 2021, on the supply cost side, we have more than offset any increases with cost savings from our suppliers. Historically, our Invigorate productivity savings have been net of any inflationary increases. Beyond that we continue to drive additional productivity improvements with platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence.  Now turning to our sales force -- excuse me, now turning to our workforce. Quest employees are highly engaged, based on results of our quality surveys. In a challenging labor market, we are focused and are still seeing improvement and engagement in retention. Our team has done a lot to create an inspiring workplace. And we continue to do everything we can to attract, recruit and retain talent. We're entering 2022 in a strong position within the lab industry and more broadly throughout healthcare. Our base business is poised to build off the record revenues we've achieved last year and we're investing to accelerate growth. We expect to see continued demand for COVID-19 testing services, albeit at lower levels than the last two years. The delay of the 2022 PAMA cuts announced last year was a good outcome for industry and Medicare beneficiaries. However, we will continue to be hard at work in 2022, with our trade association and Members of Congress with the goal of arriving at a permanent fix to PAMA.  We remain committed to our capital employment strategy of returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. This morning, we raised our dividend for the 11th time since 2011. We expect to have more than $1 billion in cash available this year for M&A and share repurchases. So putting it all together, our 2022 guidance reflects strong momentum and investment in our base business, balanced with the inevitable but expected decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.  Before turning over to Mark, I'd like to recognize and thank once again, all of our employees who really have been at the frontlines of the pandemic and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. Now Mark will provide more detail on our performance and our 2022 guidance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $2.74 billion, down 8.6% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 8.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected low revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by continued growth in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, and was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions.  Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1.1%. Compared to our fourth quarter 2019 baseline total base testing volumes increased by more than 10%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 5% versus 2019 and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. The progress we've made in our base business throughout 2021 continued in the fourth quarter, and base testing volumes remained consistent with our prior outlook.  As many of you know COVID-19 testing volumes moderated early in the fourth quarter, following the peak of the Delta wave in September, but then surged again in early December as the Omicron variant spread across the U.S. Together with our JV partners Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 7.9 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 7.3 million molecular tests and nearly 730,000 Serology tests in the fourth quarter. In January, our COVID-19 molecular volumes averaged approximately 120,000 tests per day, and over 139,000 per day, including Sonora Quest, with volumes peaking in the middle of the month.  Revenue per acquisition declined 9.8% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. In the fourth quarter increases in our base revenue per acquisition were more than offset by the impact of recent PLS revenues. Modest unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations.  Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $536 million, or 19.5% of revenues, compared to $795 million, or 26.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis operating income in Q4 was $579 million, or 21.1% of revenues, compared to $860 million or 28.6% of revenues last year. As you may recall, updated 2021 guidance we shared in October contemplated a lower adjusted operating margin both year-over-year and versus 3Q. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue and higher COVID-19 testing costs, headcount and wage increases and ramping strategic growth investments.  It's important to note that over time, a growing portion of our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes have come from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses and logistics cost. Also spiking COVID-19 positivity rates across the country in December eliminated our tooling capability, which further increased COVID-19 testing costs later in the quarter. In addition, we also experienced higher than anticipated employee healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, primarily related to COVID-19.  Reported EPS was $3.12 in the quarter, compared to $4.21 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.33, compared to $4.48 last year. Cash provided by operations was $2.23 billion in 2021, versus $2.01 billion in the prior year. We completed our $1.5 billion ASR in November, and repurchased that additional 310 million in stock in the fourth quarter. This brings total share repurchases to more than $2.2 billion in 2021. And we ended the year with $872 million on the balance sheet.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to comment on recent trends we've seen in our labor costs. As Steve noted, we've been managing through a challenging labor environment, while wage inflation including our annual merit increase is expected to be between 3% to 4% this year. The increase in our total salaries, wages and benefits is expected to be below 3% in 2022, given the reset of our annual performance compensation, and lower expected overtime. As a reminder, all of our employees are eligible for annual performance. Now turning to guidance. We are giving full year 2022 results as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 17% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.3 and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 6%. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $700 million and $1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 75% reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.63 and $8.33, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.65 to $9.35.  Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our 2022 guidance. As Steve said, we're entering 2022 in a strong position. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average between 65,000 to 80,000 tests per day in Q1, representing a decline from January wells, and approximately 20,000 to 35,000 tests per day for the full year.  For COVID-19 serology volumes the guidance assumes approximately 3,000 tests per day for the full year. Our guidance does not currently anticipate another COVID wave. We will remain ready from an operational standpoint to handle any future surges. Last month, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through April. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could continue to get renewed beyond April, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance.  The revenues generated from COVID-19 testing have afforded us an opportunity to continue to increase investment in our business. As Steve noted earlier, we continued to ramp investment in our growth pillars, particularly the advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing opportunities. We are planning to invest approximately $160 million in our growth initiatives this year, which represents an additional $90 million in investments in 2022 versus 2021.  We also continue to incur hard costs to manage your business through the pandemic, including expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address ongoing supply chain challenges and maintain adequate staffing levels. We currently forecast these expenses to be approximately $50 million in 2022.  As a reminder, we originally expected PAMA cuts of approximately $80 million in 2022. These cuts were delayed one year until 2023. Finally, we ended 2021 with approximately 124 million diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance assumes no change in our share count in 2022, and only enough share repurchases to offset our employee equity programs and to meet our commitment of the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.  I will now turn it back to Steve. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, the Sunrise  had another record year providing critical COVID-19 testing for our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. We also grew our base businesses to a record level of 19% versus the prior year. Quest is well positioned in 2022 to deliver on its commitments. I'm proud of the incredible accomplishments of our 50,000 Quest employees throughout the pandemic. And finally, our team is strong, the business has never been better, and Quest's future is bright as we begin a gradual transition to new leadership.  Thank you. Be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions at the request of the company. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back into the queue.  And the first question is coming from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is open. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Hey, good morning. First, I know this isn't the end. But congrats Steve and Mark on the retirement and Jim, congrats on earning the big feat. Agreed, it's very well deserved for you.
James E. Davis : Thank you, Jack. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Jack.
Mark Guinan: Thanks Jack.
Jack Meehan: So first question. There's been a lot of anxiety around pressures on the lab industry, which I personally find very interesting, because historically, that's actually been the bull case for Quest. So it would just be great to get your thoughts on what you're hearing from hospitals around outsourcing. Have you picked up any new contracts and potential for share gain versus some of these regional independent labs? 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, thanks, Jack, for the question. There is a lot of pressure in our industry, and particularly at hospitals. And so we are seeing continued interest and are working with hospital systems and helping them become more efficient and productive with their professional lab services business. That continues to be a big opportunity. You saw in our prepared remarks it grew nicely over the last couple of years. We have a half a billion dollar business, and therefore that moves, it moves our enterprise a significant level. So that's number one.  Number two, is we are very strong, and we continue to drive operational excellence. As you all know, this is not new, it's institutionalized in Quest. We believe we have the cadence and the capabilities to continue to offset any inflationary pressure we have. And we've done that. We did it last year, we'll continue to do that going forward. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, our array included Invigorate. We talked about inflationary pressures on our cost of sales. By the Invigorate savings is a net number. So any increases, offset by the saving always been positive for us and getting more savings than cost increases.  And so despite, some pressures that we see, because of the current times, we're offsetting that, and going forward, we do see that smaller laboratories will have a tougher time keeping up with some of these structures. And therefore, we do have an advantage. We saw the acquisition, we just did a flap jack in South Carolina; we are achieving that 2% growth from acquisitions. So therefore, we believe our strategy has positioned us nicely going forward to take advantage of the changes in front of us given this different times than we've ever seen. So Mark anything you'd like to add to that. 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, I think the other thing that's evolving jack that you didn't mention, I'm sure it's on your radar is moves towards transparency in pricing, whether it's surprise billing. Now, certainly is complicated. So even for us, it's not simple, would depend which commercial insurance, depends on who your carrier is and so on. So it's not simple to tell people exactly what their cost is. However, it's absolutely an advantage for the national labs , specifically for Quest. So we're encouraged by some of this. It's kind of one of those secrets that a lot of people aren't aware how much better our value is compared to others.  So we really see that together with some of the things you mentioned as another reason that we're going to continue to pick up share and really return to those historic rates we were having before the pandemic started, with greater access and the knowledge, tools and value that we bring well beyond our price, including our real time estimation tools, including our MyQuest app, and all the other things that really enhance the patient experience. 
Jack Meehan: Great, and as a follow up on the disclosures around the fourth quarter detection testing system, $7.9 million total, $7.3 resulted by Quest, $600,000, through the referral network. Can you talk about just the profitability on the tests that accrue to referral network versus those resulted by Quest? Because I think people just trying to figure out the relative margin upside versus revenue and wondering if maybe that was a factor we weren't considering.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, so to be clear, except for referral network, we have a JV with Sonora Quest. So we wanted to make sure that people were aware that we're doing some math around referral on the testing volumes that we don't actually to record that revenue, because we have a minority ownership stake. So we get a proportionate share of the earnings from Sonora Quest, as we do with our other minority holdings, as we do with our majority holdings to equity earnings. So we just wanted to drive that transparency.  But in terms of pricing, and so on, so forth, I won't comment specifically on Sonora Quest. But it's not dissimilar, it's not a totally different profit structure than the things that we do ourselves. In Jack, during this less than 5% of our total volume is sent out to a referral lab. At this point in time, its effect on zero. So it's only during a surge, that we have to rely on external partner labs to help us.  Yes, what I did refer to Jack, and maybe that's what you were asking about was non-traditional channels. And so that's not where we're sending the work. It's actually how we're getting the specimens. So a lot of the work especially early was through traditional channels, or hospital partners, where we were going anyways, to collect specimens, and we would leverage all the Quest Logistics, in cases where we had people going to our ACE trauma centers, we're leveraging that.  In this case, we're actually getting it from other providers, CVS is the most notable one. As we do that, we have to have an incremental logistics structure with that incremental logistic runs. Then we do pay a fee. You kind of think about it kind of like phlebotomy, but all the work they do to collect the specimen, to engage the administrative costs of the patient to give them the results, and so there is a cost that maybe people weren't aware of when we're not getting that specimen to our traditional infrastructure. 
Jack Meehan: Great. Thanks for clearing that up. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question?
Operator: The next question is coming from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann. 
Ann Hynes: Good morning. Congratulations to Steve, Mark, and Jim. 
James E. Davis : Thank you.
Ann Hynes: I just want to ask about margins, because obviously, the stock's down or underperforming, year to date versus some peers. And I think there's debate on the street about the margin profile for Quest ex-COVID. I know you guy's saw lot of pressure in q4, it was at worse than expected. And a follow up to that is, again you just got to 2022. People are really focused on what your margin profile will be in 2023. In your prepared remarks, Mark, you did talk about growth initiatives that are in 2020 to $160 million, and I think you said $50 million for incremental costs.  But I guess like, there's so many moving parts with extra labor costs, extra supply cost, you have these growth investments. I guess with -- if we look out to 2023, not giving guidance, like what do you think is repeatable and what is not? Maybe you can just comment on just the health of how you view your base margins, and the base business, that'd be great.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ann. It's important one. So first off, we're not deviating from our long term outlook. So we've shared a long term outlook in March of 2021. And while the CAGRs are going to change, because we're going to have a stronger year in 2022, and the carriers I quoted that that time, were putting 2022 forward, the absolute numbers we're not deviating from because they're largely the base fitness. So we still assume that COVID will materially decline, you know, time will tell. At that point, it's really all-round our base business.  So when people are looking at the current profitability of the base business, and I can understand how this happens. One of the flaws of that is that there really -- you can't really do the two in isolation. So let me give some examples. Because we've had such a surprisingly strong year, this year relative to what we expected, driven by COVID, we're paying a significantly higher incentive performance bonus. And that's across the whole employee base. And, right now, that would not be expected to be repeated next year.  So that, quote, inflated our costs. And so to assign all of that cost against the base business, which is what implicitly it's done, when you do COVID revenue times a certain margin drop through, and then you assume back against the base business, that is not accurate. The other thing is, we have significant incremental costs related to the pandemic, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, around $50 million of cost. If COVID really goes away, we would expect those costs will largely go away. And those costs are really be assigned to COVID, not to the base business.  We had quite a bit of overtime later in the year. And that was related to employee absences driven by the COVID surge, and we spent about $25 million more in 2021, then we historically spend in over time. And we would expect that would go away, as well, as COVID starts to step back. And so again, that that s implicitly put against the big business, when you do the high level math that I've seen a lot of people do. And so the way to think about the base business is obviously from our guidance, we are hundreds of millions of dollars above where we were in 2019.  We expect to be back to the growth that we were experiencing pre-pandemic. I know, it seems like a long time. But if you look at the first two months, and we mentioned this several times of 2020, before the pandemic started, even after a full year of the network access teams we have in 2019, we're still growing mid-single digits. We're going to get back to that growth, okay, in the base business. And the profitability of the base business is going to be similar to what it was before 2019.  So hopefully, that puts all the pieces together for you. Obviously, there's anything I can clarify, I'd be happy to take a follow up. 
Ann Hynes: No, that's very helpful. And just as a follow up, just to your growth initiatives, like the $9 million incremental in 2022. How should we view that for 2023? 
Steve Rusckowski: Right, so some of those will ramp down, because there are discrete investments to get us where we need to get to. So for instance, a big piece of that is building what we need for our consumer is fantastic. And to move from where we were to a more Amazon like, not that we'll get completely there, but experience for patients who want to find tests and order it, pay their bill, et cetera is expensive. It takes a lot of work with marketing analytics to do the appropriate marketing and understanding of customer preferences, and respond to customers in appropriate way. A lot of IT investment in the near term to get us to that future state.  Now as we're growing that business to a $0.25 billion, which is what we said we would get to by 2025, there are going to be some ongoing costs, because we're adding people to support that business. It isn't a grown up business. And there are going to be some variable costs with that. However, as we grow those businesses, we're going to grow fast. And so some of those ongoing costs are going to get paid for that faster growth. And then I would say similarly, advanced diagnostics, as we accelerate that growth, some of the resources we're adding today that we're calling out pre that growth are going to be in the run rate and profitability going forward.  So the costs don't go away completely, but they will ramp down because some of this is kind of startup expenses. And then that revenue, obviously in the end, the margin is going to pay for those incremental costs over the next several years.  Only it's after that . Remember, when we talked about this year, these investments really started in the back half of 2020. And we talked about an exceptional year in 2020. We talked about an exceptional year in 2021. And therefore we took advantage of the opportunity invested in accelerated growth entirely consistent with what we share with you as our growth portfolio portfolio. And what you're seeing in our results, our ranges, the benefits of those investments, you're seeing great growth in our focus areas of advanced diagnostics. I highlighted those areas of our portfolio that we focus on.  And these are not insignificant portions of our portfolio. I share my  several 100 millions of dollars of focus for us that are growing strong double digits versus last year versus 2019. And then secondly, is our consumer initiative testing business has grown considerably. We talked about $70 billion, almost half to 250 . And so therefore, we're already starting to see the benefits. So as with any of that we certainly expect a business return. We're getting some evidences of return already. '21 looks like more of it than '22. And so when we get into '23, you got to track that.  They were not served in the beginning. What we're putting on right time is exactly what we laid out on Investor Day. That is, we have a baseline coming out of '22 that we believe in, and what we just shared in our '22 guidance is entirely consistent with that. And we will continue to grow our earnings. The high growth, we highlighted 7% to 9%, and that will continue through '23 and '24. So we feel what we've done so far, and what we delivered is entirely consistent with what we believe the prospects of -- we do believe the opportunity in front of us are even more attractive than before, because we found the proceeds, was relative to accelerate the program was real. 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, just one point of clarification. So the 7% to 9% was when we thought we could do $7.40 $8 in 2022. And we said we'd be at the upper end of that. So you can pick your number between $7.40 and $8, carry forward $7 to $8, through '23 and '24. And that dollar level of EPS is what we're saying we can still do. Obviously, since 2022, is turning out based on our guidance, a lot higher than we said in March, the CAGR is going to be lower. But the absolute numbers we're still committed to at this point. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, we're going to go to the next question. I just want to let everyone know, we won't go past the bottom of the hour. We have a lot of folks in queue. We want to get to all your questions. Operator? 
Operator: And the next question is going to be from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, A.J.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, A.J.
A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. Best wishes on the transition to all. And maybe just to ask M&A pipeline. A, any update on what you're seeing out there, what the opportunity set looks like? B, does the management transition cause you in any way to pull back or to pivot in a different direction in organic growth prospects? And then just maybe finally on the Pack Health deal? That was obviously not a huge deal, but an interesting one. Does that suggest a pivot, and what's sort of the opportunity there with that acquisition? 
Steve Rusckowski: A.J., thanks. We continue to believe that we can continue to deliver that 2% growth off our base business going forward. We've delivered that in the past, and we have every reason to believe that we will continue going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see hospitals looking at what we've done with other hospitals, and opportunity for them to rely on us as the testing and that product continues to build. And we continue to look at some outreach purchases with hospitals.  And then, as I mentioned, Labtech was a good example of a regional laboratory and a good piece of the United States that we picked up as well. And we continue to look at acquisitions that build on our portfolio. Remember, we have this lens of focusing on general diagnostics. Jim Davis, runs that business, in addition to that advanced diagnostics. But the third pieces are those services that take the information that we generate, and we provide services, and we do this employer population health. And we built on that business to work with health plans, on helping them manage the risk with the data and providing services that help them do that.  So Pack Health fits into that direction for the company. And we've done some other acquisitions that help us with that direction as well. And you're going to hear more about -- we will continue to invest in that space going forward. And also in your question, does the management change slow us down in any way and here what we might do an acquisition, I would say to the contrary, you know, Jim's been part of the management team for over eight years. He's highly engaged in all acquisitions. He's been instrumental in executing all of our acquisitions. And all the businesses that he participated in are always part of the funnel building that we have.  So Jim any remarks about the 40 acquisitions we've done, and your team to find more opportunities. 
James E. Davis : No, A.J., as Steve said, I've been part of all 40 of those acquisitions. And it's not going to slow down. We're not going to do -- we're going to do smart deals. We're going to be selective, but we're going to continue to build our base business. We're going to continue to find niche applications to build out our events diagnostics portfolio, and we're going to continue to focus on hospital outreach deals, those that are willing to get out of business. We're right there ready to help out. 
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, A.J. 
Operator: The next question is coming from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey. Two questions. Maybe just one on some recent payer negotiations. Obviously, you guys have talked a lot about inflationary pressures and supply chain things. How much does that come up in kind of the negotiations with payers? Are you able to pass that along? I know you guys are in a pretty good place, with payers relative to historic levels. So maybe just talk through some of those conversations and ability to pass price along and price increases in those payer contracts.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Thanks Patrick. Well, so there's a lot of attention these days on inflationary pressures. And we think we've handled those questions. We think it's all very manageable for us, in terms of our operational excellence programs, and finding the productivity, we need to offset it. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece is what you're bringing up, is around pricing. And we feel good about what we delivered in that regard.  Matter of fact, if you look at the results for '21, what you find is that their unit price changes, and this is freezing everything from volume in meds, and just looking at unit price changes is below that 100 basis points that we typically are guiding you to dial into expectations going forward. And that's not just for our commercial insurance contract. It's all our businesses, our hospital business, it's our client business, independent of what whose clients might be, physicians or some other organization we work with.  So we continue to make progress on that. And we're particularly encouraged by the discussions we're having with our plans. We've shared in the past that actually, in the past, several negotiations, we've actually introduced price increases. And it is actually helping us that in fact, there is inflationary pressure across all of healthcare. So therefore, we're not alone, since we're a labor based business to pass along some of those costs to them.  So we're making good progress. And I say that the other piece of this, Patrick is, we continue to deliver great value. Our quality gets better, our service gets better. And we do that in a very competitive price already. And many of these plans believe that's in the best interest of them and their membership of growing share, is to make sure they rely on a handful of top flight laboratories, in the case of United Healthcare, they call that for labs network. And we had applied to that. And we had to demonstrate with evidence that, in fact, we have great quality. We have great service, and we're doing at very competitive prices.  So that trend will continue. When you talk about that, we're going to eventually keep on pushing us to deliver more and more value, which helps you in terms of managing your network. We, in many cases are going to start looking at some price increases going forward. So good progress there. Thanks for asking the question. Mark, anything you want to add? 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, I just want to remind people of what we talked about, over our tenure. We have this Invigorate program, drives about 3% productivity. We call it productivity, because some of it is top line enhancing. It's not all around costs. And we've mentioned the fact that we have these pay fors . And one of them has been priced stretched. One of them has been annual labor inflation. And then we talked about the fact that as we got priced in a better place that actually was helping with margin expansion.  So we have enough productivity to do more than the pay fors. So now we look at where we are today, and as Steve mentioned, a much better position. I can't specifically say it's related to inflation. But I can assure you that that is part of the conversation in addition to PAMA, and the value that we bring in, so and so. We've really moved the conversation dramatically from when we started here, to more about value. And fortunately for us, I can share that in the last three national payer contracts, all three of them, we got an increase. That was modest. But you compare that to where we've been historically, great news.  And that also means that even if we have a little more inflation, and I think we talked about this quite a bit, we've got plenty of Invigorate. And that Invigorate now, doesn't need to cover as much of the price erosion that we have historically. And that price erosion that Steve shared is really heavily in the clientele. And as we've talked over the last number of earnings calls that comes from the hospital clients who are under tremendous pressure, and we shared the reasons for that. And also in some states where physicians can do clientele markup, we have that pressure as well.  And really with the commercial payers, we're in a really good place on prices lately. 
Patrick Donnelly: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a quick follow up on COVID. Maybe pricing and volume, you mentioned no expectation for the PHE to continue to be extended in the second half or at least is not baked in, sorry. How do you think about the pricing piece both commercial? Will they follow -- kind of wait for the PHE? And then the volume side, you are expecting it to be endemic. A lot of the diagnostic players have obviously talked about multiple years of COVID revenues going out. Just curious on your take there. Thank you. 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So what we're assuming in our values is getting some ranges of what we think COVID testing will be. Obviously, it's going to start higher in the first quarter, it's going to go down, as we're hopeful that this current surge will decline throughout the spring and into the summer. And as you mentioned, we did get the 90 day extension. And then we're not planning in the guidance that that will be extended, but we just don't know. So therefore, we're always assuming the worst case. And that if that were to come down, yes, we do believe there will be some price changes, if you will, with some of our partners.  But again, what we've implied in the guidance is kind of volumes and some decline in pricing. And also the assumption that we're not going to get a renewal of the emergency order. But again, we don't know that. So Mark anything you'd like to add? 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, just to remind you -- not that I need to remind you all that, the rates that CMS determined at $51. And so while we don't assume post PHE that everything falls immediately there, there's a pretty steep ramp down. And then so for the volume that is in our guidance beyond the PHE in late April, we're assuming a significantly lower reimbursement than we've experienced to-date and that we're expecting to get till late April. 
Steve Rusckowski: Next question? 
Operator: The next question is coming from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Good morning, and best wishes to all of you. Jim you are going to be my fourth Quest CEO I'll be working with. So very excited. 
James E. Davis : Thank you.
Ricky Goldwasser: Dating all the way back to Ken Freeman's days. So I just wanted to go back to sort of what the 2022 baseline is. Since this has got like really the bulk of the questions we're getting from investors sort of how should we think about the 2022 normalized baselines that we can build off for 2023? I know that you kind of said in response to one of the questions that in terms of absolute EPS, you are where you expected to be last year. But if maybe you can give us the range, right? We're getting to somewhere between kind of like $7.60 to $7.80 is a normalized based on for $4.2 as a starting point.  Just wanted to kind of like see if we're in the ballpark. And then off that maybe just qualitatively what are the headwinds and tailwinds that we should think about as we think about modeling out to 2023. 
Steve Rusckowski: Go ahead Mark.
Mark Guinan: Yeah, so. I'm sure you understand Ricky, even if I was willing, I can't really give you an EPS number on the face. So I think the best thing I could do is, point you to pre-pandemic, revenue and earnings and tell you that if you look at the growth in the base business based on what we're giving in guidance, the profitability is not dissimilar. So you can kind of directionally place where that business might be. And the reason I can't really give is back to what I talked about earlier.  So where do I assign the $50 million of pandemic expense? Arguably, if we didn't have COVID testing, we would still have that cost. And you'd say, okay, let's go about your base business. But the truth is that we also have the COVID testing in revenue. So again COVID revenue is going to go into the base business. And then importantly, when you talk about headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect that cost to go away and should be temporary, because it is specifically tied to CDC guidelines and other things.  We talked about some of the others, you know, some things including there, like supply disruptions. I don't know how long that's going to last. And we all know, it's not just in our business. It's across all aspects of life today, and it's modeled to go away in 12 months, not sure. That's certainly something we want to absolutely make sure that we have what we need. And so we are paying premium costs right now, relative to what we did pre pandemics in insurance, get to our patient service centers, our laboratories have everything they need. And that's really kind of our insurance, which fortunately, we can afford to do right now. Because we also do have that COVID revenue and COVID margin.  So really, I think that's the best color I could give you which is the base business is in good shape. We activate Q4 organically back to where we were in 2019. We've done significant M&A over the last couple of years, we've built the PLS business. So beyond the organic clinical business, we're hundreds of millions of dollars higher. And while the profitability and all that may not be precisely the same directionally people could feel confident that the profitability has moved at least to that growth .
Steve Rusckowski: So to remind you, our base business in '21 was larger than what we had in 2019. So it has grown. So it has recovered. And we're going to grow on top of that. And that's implied in our guidance for base business. And we intentionally broke out basis from COVID assumptions for '22. So you can kind of dissect who or what's going on with that business. And I keep on reminding you of investments that we're making are part of our base business. And we started those investments in '21. They continue in '22, and therefore, that's going to help us accelerate growth.  And as Mark said, we feel very confident about the profitability of our base systems. And by the way, when I said in my introductory remarks, is we do not believe COVID is going to entirely go away. It's going to be part -- a permanent part of our portfolio. So you should assume there's some COVID testing in '23 as well. We will continue to still play a role with our PCR testing. And we believe there's a growing role for serology particularly related to our ability to be able to provide some insight around the protection that individuals have in their bodies. And we're going to have more on that to come.  But you put it together is -- and we believe the prospects for '23 and beyond are quite bright. So thank you. 
James E. Davis : Ricky, I would add one other thing. And that's as probably Mark stated at the pace business has recovered in 2019 levels are still not going to interject in terms of a headwind. There's still pent up demand for routine clinical care. If you look at the studies around HIV infection rates, hepatitis C infection rates, the data still indicates that there was a lack of routine clinical care during the pandemic. And we do think that should provide some headwinds going into the later part of this year and next year. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. 
Operator: And the next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. And congratulations all around. I guess I'll follow up to that last answer that you gave. Yeah. So as we think about COVID becoming more endemic, rather than what it is today, is it probably more correct to think of this opportunity or this part of your business as something like say, the flu -- the flu test where some of it's -- or most of its point of care, and then a big -- a small chunk of it sent over to you guys? And then how should we be thinking about the economics if that was the case? 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Well, let me start, and then my colleagues will round it out, I'm sure. So this isn't going away anytime soon. I think obviously, that we're going to have COVID in '23. And we're going to provide testing around that. And as you know, because you're living with it everyday, like the rest of us, when somebody has some symptoms, you're ruling out COVID. In many cases, that is a PCR test, and that will continue. So therefore, you don't think about just being flu, but it's any type of respiratory illness, and it could be a common cold or another respiratory illness. So there'll be continuation of that, going forward.  And also, we keep on highlighting the value of serology. There is going to be increased role for us to provide insight on how much protection people have from vaccines or from natural immunity. And as we know, that's changing over time. And people want to have that insight to, manage the risk and work with their physician on that. So we think there, there's going to be increased value in that. So we do believe, in '23, this is going to be a permanent part of our portfolio.  It's hard right now to scale that and we'll learn more as we get into '22. But when we think about it, we actually think of this as an additional portion of a product line that we didn't have before the pandemic. So we actually decided that it was helpful to, achieve the value we think we have. And then as Jim said, base business continues to be in really strong shape. We crossed the growth of '19 sooner in '21, we're entering '22 in . Our growth prospects, there continue to be ones that we continue to work. So that should continue to be a good opportunity for ourselves.  So we're filling our chips together well, and COVID is going to products provide more fuel for us to make these investments in our base business that help us and 23. So we Yes, we're focused on what the costs are, but we only make these investments if in fact, we expect to get the returns and you'll see those returns, both in '22. But also in '23 and beyond. So Mark anything you'd like to that? 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, thanks. Brian, it's a great question. And we can't predict with any certainty what's going to happen. I think the two unknowns are, how comfortable will physicians be with taking the specimen sample themselves in the office going forward? And maybe they'll be very comfortable like that with the flu where maybe they'll be like, no, I'd rather I'd rather not handle that. I'd rather not do that point of care test and all the risks that come with that. I'll just send it to a lab. But then the other one, really importantly, the economics. So the payers are going to have a lot of influence on whether this is done.  Now yes, point of care testing, arguably, some people do it for faster turnaround times. But a lot of it is done because they make money off of it. So depending on what the payers decide around point of care reimbursement that will have a large influence on how much of this work comes to us and how much that of it stays in the office. Then let me just stop and ask Jim to comment on this. 
Steve Rusckowski: If you look at our volumes are impressive. We've had a challenge this year, because of the infection rate, and therefore our ability not to be able to fail to deliver on cooling , which is more capacity and lower costs. But that will come back with infection rate, which dropped. But as we go forward with this, we start to see this becoming more of an epidemic and less of a pandemic, then there's a lot of players in this marketplace, and Jim and his team are entirely focused on what we have for sure today, and what we could do going forward to gain some share going forward.  So when you think about the opportunity around COVID, if you look at that market, you think about Quest Diagnostics, you think about the dynamics of the short run, where there's been some opportunistic players. We're not optimistic. This is going to be part of a permanent part of our portfolio. And therefore we also are pushing hard, and making sure that we get what we believe what you have to share in the short term. But also in the long term, we think there might be an opportunity as well to pick up some share. Jim, you'd like to add to that.
James E. Davis : Yeah, what we did find during this last surge is we had a series of 10 default partners that we've referred work out to, when we couldn't handle the volume, especially during peak days during the work. And at least 50% of those partners had gotten out of business and decided they just didn't want to rebrand for capacity. So while there may be the physical capacity out there, some of that physical capacity, especially on the PCR side has returned to the clinical kinds of work that those firms were doing, other molecular work.  So that is, I think advantages us in the future, if there is another surge here. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. 
Operator: And the next question is coming from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve and Mark it's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And congrats to you, Jim, on this promotion. A lot of questions thrown around the space business. So let me ask this a different way. I believe you general guide from an $8.50 EPS range for 2023 was from limited COVID earnings. Can you talk about EBIT margins in 2023 versus the 17% range seen in 2019 without COVID? So I believe are within that guidance range are implying essentially flat margins, with Invigorate offsetting inflationary pressures? Is that just the right takeaway, that we should be leaving today's call with? 
Mark Guinan: Yeah, so we intentionally don't really target or comment on margins, because we believe value creation can come at different levels of margin. Then we talked about specifically on PLS, where it's great growth, great return on invested capital. And those are the two biggest correlators to shareholder value creation. But they come at a lower margin. So we don't worry about margin Pito per se, but I understand others do. And so to answer your question, there's a pretty broad range, you know, obviously, one year less than over multiple years when you put a CAGR with a couple 100 basis points differential on the top line and bottom line.  So there's a lot of different combinations. So what I would say is, your EPS number that you mentioned, is not unreasonable. And you can figure out the revenue based on what we said, at Investor Day, and then what we're guiding to this year in terms of the base business, and yeah, at this point, we're not counting on COVID to be significantly larger than maybe a flu business or something like that. But certainly, we don't know. And there's a chance that it could be larger than that. And that will be determined over the next 12 months or so.  So that's about strongest color I can give you right now, is back to what we said. If you're really good about our base business going forward, we're going to adapt to that growth level. And I want to remind everybody that when we grow organically, the drop down is much higher than that 17% or, the 19.5% that we delivered in Q4, and so on. It drops down at a level, you know, 50% or more depending if it's an existing customer, where we're expanding the menu, or it's a new customer, where we do have to invest a little maybe in logistics and in IT for the interfaces.  But growth brings with it margin expansion, in addition to Invigorate. That's why we're confident we can grow earnings faster than top line, from that period forward. 
Pito Chickering: Okay, so just if I ask the question just a different way, not on the margin side. Let me -- I just sort of think about 2023 EBIT versus 2019 sort of a cleaner non-COVID numbers, we should be modeling to sort of a low teens EBIT, increase in '23 relative to 2019. 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, I mean, you can -- yeah, I mean, you can do the math. Yes. I mean… 
Mark Guinan:  about earnings per share. 
Steve Rusckowski: Okay, good. So what we -- Mark just said what we said is, we've always provided our outlook and guidance for our mix  per share, because we do have a mix of business, we do have some lower margin business, that might be a good value creating opportunity for us, we're going to go after it like a PLS business. So our guidance for EPS would be expansion of EPS over time, rebasing it, if you will, for these changes that we've seen for the last two years. And Mark has reiterated our belief that our base business will fuel good opportunities for us to continue to deliver against that.  By the way, as we continue to gain share, variable gross margin is quite good. And as I said, we also believe there's going to be some COVID in '23. And it's hard to size it right now, but it's not going to go away soon.
Mark Guinan: Yeah. And then the other thing is that, I'm not in any position to provide guidance in 2023. So that's why we're focusing every one of the things there. However, when you think about what can happen, COVID can be larger. We don't know, we're not counting at this point. And then we did mention we've got a -- we expect a billion dollars of cash this year. So between opportunity to quite a bit of M&A, and we'll see, or do share repurchases, those also aren't specifically contemplated.  So that's why like locking down to a specific number is really difficult and probably not productive. So I would point you to what we said at investor day, and kind of assuming that that's reasonable if these things don't play out significantly differently from our current view of what 2043 might bring. 
Pito Chickering: Great, thanks so much guys. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. 
Operator: And the next question is coming from Matt Larew of William Blair. Your line is open. 
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning. The 3% Invigorate target has been aided in recent years as you've consolidated volume onto your two new labs and consolidated into one amino acid platform. I'm curious, what are the keys going forward here to keep driving those gains? And then maybe the second piece on cost would be separate from some of the extra costs you've called out today related to COVID, clearly, you've built up some infrastructure, both personnel and instrumentation for COVID.  I'm just curious how much of that you think goes away as COVID moves to an endemic perhaps you need less extra capacity? 
Steve Rusckowski: Great, thanks for the question. I'll weigh in and turn to Jim to add to the answer. We've been working on operational excellence for over a decade, and it has become institutionalized in our company culture, and embedded in how we do things. And it is, is a platform for how we're going to continue to grow. So your comment was around costs. We don't talk about cost, we talked about productivity, because there's a lot of aspects of what we do around Invigorate and some actually helps the top line, some actually helps getting more output with less labor. And yes, some helps us to become more efficient by less input from some of the materials that we use.  So we looked at an aggregate, and we continue to be bullish on our prospects. We believe that it is the ingredients for us to continue to deliver great value. That is when we do this we improve our quality, or service gets better. And oh, by the way, we become more and more productive to be able to make investments to fuel the growth. So it all fits together. And when we talk about this, and we talked about at Investor Day. We see an enormous opportunity for us to continue to digitize and innovate in operational excellence.  And so some of you have had the opportunity to tour through our latest lab of the future and that's our new facilities -- facility in Clifton, New Jersey. Sometimes if you come in, you'll see what we've done and take some of the learnings out of our Marlborough facility up in the Boston area. We brought that down to Clifton and we built on it. And that also gives us advantages of some consolidation with some of our new platforms. But Jim and the team are now taking that, and thinking about okay, what's next?  Okay, so we think about innovation in our space, yes, there's innovation in terms of testing, and as far as diagnostic information services. But we equally think there's a lot of innovation and opportunity for us to move forward. So we continue to invest. And we talk about investments, we talk about the use of cash. As you notice, we've been putting about $40 million a year into our capital budget, which is investments and frankly, a lot of our innovation that allow us to fuel this productivity game. So Jim?
James E. Davis : Yeah, I think Steve has touched on three key themes, automation, use of artificial intelligence, and the continued digitization of so many products. So Marlborough and Clifton are terrific examples of that. But as you know, they're all brand new laboratories. We've got 20 plus other laboratories in our network. And there's opportunities in every one of those laboratories without building new Greenfield sites to continue that automation journey. In particular, in our processing area, and what we call our fluid handling system, handling of blood and urine.  On the artificial intelligence side, you're going to see us move in pathology, psychology, microbiology, we've got some great examples of each of those departments today. We're deploying artificial intelligence systems that help with the readout of those images. And then Steve mentioned just the continued digitization. Now beyond the immunoassay platform where we consolidated around the , there are still other opportunities like that in our laboratories.  We recently ran a competition in your analysis, so likely to new vendors is next for that platform. And are rolling out those two platforms across all 23 Plus laboratories, it's going to generate a lot of productivity year over year. So as long as we have healthy third party vendors that continue to innovate, those innovations will come to our labs. And we'll continue along that 3% productivity journey. 
Steve Rusckowski: So we're bullish on the prospects of continuing to drive productivity. I always react to this as a cost cutting goal. And this is not all about cost cutting goal. This is about working smarter. And this has been a key part of our strategy. And it fuels growth. And Jim mentioned some of the areas. I picture my internship  also digital pathology, which revolutionized our ability to diagnose and treat and to do that more productively. And this week, Jim is going up another laboratory to take a look at where we're going to make our next investment this year.  So we're going to invest in the space. And we have a lot more opportunity in front of us. So it's exciting. 
James E. Davis : Yeah, I just want to add that, remember, this is not just in the lab. So there's a lot of productivity that's driven outside. And specifically, I'll give two examples, logistics. So we really have an incredible ability to be efficient with logistics, and continue to improve. So we have some cases where we have empty pickups, where we have some customers that don't give us specimens all the time. It's periodic. Now we have the ability and technology to not do that empty pickup. So that's an efficiency. We also get requests for what we call staff pickups, where somebody needs something quick turnaround, et cetera. And so the ability to most efficiently get one of our vehicles there has been enhanced through our technology.  The other one is in our patient draw centers. We really can increasingly move the administrative burdens off the phlebotomist, allow them to do phlebotomy by getting people to go to our website, put in their insurance information, everything. And so the phlebotomist spends a couple less minutes with each patient doing administrative doing phlebotomy. We drive up the productivity in our draw centers.  So those are just a couple examples of productivity gains that aren't really cost reductions, but enhance our ability to do more with the same resources and drive up our quality and everything else outside the laboratory. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator next question please. 
Operator: The next question is coming from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys, this is Kapian  for Tycho. Congratulations to all. Can you maybe talk towards the percentage of COVID testing that was consumer initiated you know whether it's through MyQuest direct or other non-traditional avenues and how do you see that trending in 2022? You mentioned that there are different costs associated with non-traditional avenues of testing. So maybe can you quantify the difference margin profiles between traditional and non-traditional? 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, so what I can share is, go back to what we said in the prepared remarks, our consumer business was about $70 million last year, between the base and COVID, we did $2.7 million of COVID revenue. So the consumer initiated COVID testing was very small, at this point, and, it's strengthening. And again, as I said, we continue to enhance our website, when people go for that ordering, and testing and so on. But there's still more to come in terms of enhancing that experience for consumers and driving awareness for people. As you know, we're competing with a lot of people who see these stand up operations in parking lots, and so on and so forth, which draw their attention.  So we're working on making sure that they know we can do this and initiate themselves as opposed to going to a doctor or hospital for this. And we expect to get stronger and stronger moving forward as we enhance our overall consumer business through these investments we just mentioned.  In terms of the margin profile, it's really not -- it's not all that different between the consumer and consumer can add in different ways. They can come to our patient draw center and have it done there. We do have home collection kits where they can be sent to their home. So a little different structure, but not materially different in profitability.  Operator next question. 
Operator: And the next question is coming from Derrick Brown with Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Derik de Bruin: Hey, great, thank you for squeezing me in. I'll just make this quick. Can we talk a little bit about, sort of like the real -- PAMA outlook? So you would assume $80 million that again comes back in '23? I mean what are the chances that this actually does get resolved, and that the lobbying efforts pay off and gives the current administration a little bit more or Congress a little bit more willingness to listen to this, and sort of do it? I mean, there's a chance that it gets -- that there's actually some reversion, just given what happened. Thanks. 
Mark Guinan: Yeah. Before Steve addresses that I just want to remind everybody that that $80 million was built into our long term outlook. We just assumed it would happen this year. So again, although it would be a year on year get to us, you know, incrementally in comparison, in the long term outlets, it was assumed that we would get that in 2022. So it's already built that. 
Steve Rusckowski: So thanks for the question. And as we said, we were thankful that it was delayed, again, the one year offset, as Mark indicated to 23. We think that's good for us, because it will gave us some time this year, to keep on working on a permanent fix with Congress. And we have been very active working with Congress last year. And as you know, Congress was very busy with the Infrastructure Bill, and other business and therefore we're fortunate enough to get in the postponed it, but it allows us time this year to keep on working on this to get a permanent fix.  We're encouraged by the level of support, brought up the importance of testing and the importance of having a strong industry. We're getting strong, bipartisan support, both from the House and from the Senate. We made a proposal of what we think should be changed to improve the data collection process, the sampling of market based data. We continue to support the notion and the philosophy of PAMA that is we should be paid a commercial rate. But we believe that CMS has it wrong .  And in parallel with the Congress, we continue to have our lawsuit against CMS and the trade association. The judge has heard the arguments we'll see if we get some indication on a decision on that. Hard to call that, but that's still in the works as well. So our work right now this year is to push for permanent fix to PAMA. And we're better positioned now because the pandemic than before the pandemic because of the strength of this industry here in global awareness and appreciation of what we've done and the need for strong laboratory industry going forward. 
Steve Rusckowski: Operator last question please.
Operator: And our last question is coming from Eric Caldwell of Baird. Your line is open. 
Eric Coldwell: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Masterful job clearing up some of the overriding concerns on core markets today. So thank you. When you went through your list of things that don't repeat or go down significantly as COVID incremental cost overtime staffing challenges, et cetera go away. You mentioned bonuses. And I think it was the one number in the list of call outs that I didn't hear you quantify. I'm curious if we could get the incremental bonus, due to the COVID, upside profitability in '21. How you think that bonus will normalize, whether it's '22 or '23?  And then my follow-up, I'll just stow it in here. I was hoping we could get average way to reimbursement in the fourth quarter. I know you said it would be relatively similar through the PHE. But if you could give us a little more specificity on where AWR came out, in 4Q on COVID PCR testing, that would be helpful. Thanks. 
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, so let me start with that one. Because I think there was some questions around maybe with their turnaround time suffered, and we didn't get the $25 fee that comes with some of the government payers couple the current pairs. And actually, not really, AWR in Q4 was absolutely similar to what has been in the previous quarters. And our turnaround time performance was outstanding. We did in January when the surge came, we did a little bit, we did have a little bit of a hit to our turnaround time. But obviously, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we just provided and it wasn't a huge amount.  When you -- back to the early question, bonuses, and the bonuses, when we look at the bonuses, you know, most of it is really our 50,000 employees. So people think about bonuses, must be senior management. Most of the cost is really, we pay 3% bonus to even our wage workers. And then obviously, we have other staff members that you know, at higher targets. And every year we budget for what we call, one x whatever that target is. So for most of the people do 3%. And based on performance, and we feel we've had reasonable stretch performances, when we had historically, we have not paid significantly above 1x. And we've had a number of years where it's below 1x.  But the COVID, unpredictability and the surge in revenues, enabled us to pay our employees significant bonuses, in 2020. And again, in 2021. And so if you look at, without getting too specific, and we've shared a number in the past, a $3 billion wage bill, that's gone up in the last couple of years as we've grown the company. So you can kind of as a floor, say 3%, obviously a little higher, because if people want a higher bonus, that's about 1x. And then, we're paying a bonus that's substantially higher than that, in 2021, like we did in 2020.  The other thing is, we did pay out a $500 payment to the majority of our employees to compensate them for COVID expenses. In 2020, we adjusted it out of our adjusted earnings, because we were seeing COVID as temporal and extraordinary. But once you get to your second time doing it, even though I still think it's extraordinary, we just decided not to adjust it out. So we did have over a $20 million payment, late in the year, $500 to our wage employee and some of our lower compensated professionals as well.  So those are a couple of things that would go away and not be repeated like somehow, we had another surprising COVID year in 2022 like we had in 2021 
Eric Coldwell: That's a great response. I'm not sure I'm smart enough to do 1x 3% plus and insignificant increases there. Any chance you could frame that as incremental $50 million, incremental $100 million just directionally can we get a little closer? 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, let's say it's less than $100 million, but substantially more than $50 million. 
Eric Coldwell: Okay, that's about what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats to everyone. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you. Very good. Well, thanks, it's been a great session with you all. Thanks for all the great questions. And again, thanks for joining the call today and we appreciate your support. You guys have a great day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics' Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses from the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continue to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year, and 2019. In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound, in September. Importantly, our base business continues to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-then-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021, and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results, and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions. But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our quest for health equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it, just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination events to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. Recently, we announced the collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for black and Hispanic scholars to drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year. Now, turning to our results for the third quarter, total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September, to approximately $1.75 billion. Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter, due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July, and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August, and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter, and maintained strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge. As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel, and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast, and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states, with five additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on   cruise lines, and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth, and drive operational excellence. Now, here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remained strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life. So, here's a couple examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers -- employer customers improve quality, outcomes, and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to one million managed Medicaid members, in Florida, as their coverage transitions to  Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity. Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest POS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health, and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our POS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing to more than double this year. Recently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan -- panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users. In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing growth in non-evasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels, and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emergent variants, expanding all of the work that we performed in the quarter. And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic   for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians, nationally, at the end of the month. Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence, we made progress and remain on track to deliver on our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square-foot next-generation lab, in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art highly automated facility services, more than 40 million people across seven states. In patient services, we are seeing all time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our Patient Service Centers. Now more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by the appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our Phlebotomist. Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated neuro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings, once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network. And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic, and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a one-time payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs, they incurred during the pandemic. Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard earned time off. Therefore, we're providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year end. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat when compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.3% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the delta variance and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality. As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So, far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the delta variance, while the base business continues to improve since September. Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and to a lesser extent recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues, compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter, compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96, compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September, year-to-date, versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year. Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to between $10.45 and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4, and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days, through late January. We expect reimbursements of clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing. Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4, versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business. And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo, UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the details and the guidance for '21. I really want to talk about into 2022, and sort of you reiterated your guidance from March, which I believe it was at the higher end of the $7.40 to $8.00 range. And I'm just wondering at this point, what are the assumptions baked in for COVID testing into next year? Do you anticipate that it's going to continue? Do you anticipate there's going to be a meaningful decline? Any color around how you think COVID testing will proceed into next year?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, why don't you start, and then I'll follow.
Mark Guinan: Sure. And, Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022; we provided an outlook. And we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022, back in March, and base volumes have recovered. And we thought we were ahead in June, when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside, obviously, with Delta, it's -- it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic, so that's good. The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant, and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced, in the past, that at some point COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing. At this point, we feel comfortable with what we had assumed, back in March, around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envision a stronger role for serology going into 2022, and think that's a potential. So, we feel good about that. And then, we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things, like fuel, certainly were subject to inflation in the near-term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and in benefits, and especially in wages. And that, as we look at that, we gave a range, and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue and the $7.40 to $8.00 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in slightly different way, and -- but still very comfortable, that that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022.
Kevin Caliendo: Just as a quick follow-up, can you in any way quantify the higher inflationary pressures, supply chain, any of that? Is there any way to put numbers around that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, I'm sure you're most interested in 2022, so, we'll see what we can provide when we come out with guidance, in early next year, to provide clarity. Certainly at this point, well, we're experiencing some of that given the performance of the business; it hasn't prevented us from significantly over-delivering our previous guidance. So, we'll take a note of consideration, Kevin. We appreciate the question. We'll see what we can do when we talk more about next year.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: Yes, our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So, just a follow-up just as I think about costs and all the moving pieces. Obviously, the Clifton lab just opened. So, how are you thinking about the flow-through of the benefits from that and how it would potentially offset some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing on the cost side?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so, thanks, Brian, for the question. So, as you know, and what I reiterated in our prepared remarks, we've been marching with our two-point strategy for some time. And the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained, and just reiterated, that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward. And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton. And I actually also reiterated a couple other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers with new integrated platforms, what we're done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our   analysis is -- are two good examples of more work we can get the benefits from, and there's others. So, there's a lot more efficiencies in productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this isn't cost-cutting, this is improvement. And so, every time we make an improvement in our operation we expect our quality improves, and our service performance improves, and it has. So, we continue to make progress. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see it in our '22 numbers as well. And that's always been used to offset headwinds, and we do have headwinds, we've had headwinds from wage bill increases in the past, albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward, given what we see in the labor market. And then second is, we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset, and we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then, also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook, and we just reiterated our confidence, our ability to do that. So, hopefully that's helpful.
Mark Guinan: Yes, I just wanted to add a reference that the Clifton lab and its increased productivity efficiency is really part of our invigorate work that we talk about 3% productivity every year. It's not over and above or separate whatever  common is that what we've done there like we did up in Massachusetts. We have added more automation. Obviously, as you add automation, you insulate yourself a little bit from labor inflation. So, certainly, we have that going as we operate that lab, but it is built-in, and part of what my assumptions I had putting together that outlook for 2022 that we would achieve that ongoing 3% efficiency is not something specially…
Brian Tanquilut: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. So, one follow-up question on the cost, I mean, clearly we're all interested in a magnitude of the potential impact of paper and inflation. So, maybe you can help us by reminding us what percent of your cost structure today is labor and how should we think about it breakdown between cost of goods and SG&A?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, we've shared in the past pre-pandemic, that about $3 billion of our cost was related to salary and benefits. Obviously with COVID moving around it's hard to cite the precise number with including the COVID testing. So, I think that should give you a pretty good idea of what proportion of our costs a $6 plus billion. Cost base we had prior to the pandemic has made up the labor at somewhere in the 50% range. And then as we said, as we continue to automate that certainly offset some of that, but also we are seeing an increased amount of demand for phlebotomy. So, that is going the other direction. We obviously considered a net benefit because giving access helps us grow our business and certainly makes us more attractive, especially in a world of consumerism. And it's a good thing, but it certainly will drive costs, the labor costs as a percentage of all of all costs in the other direction.
Ricky Goldwasser: And then just a follow-up on the direct-to-consumer point, Steve, you mentioned a soft launch of comprehensive health plan, all that's directed in consumer. Can you just share with us what has been the response to date and maybe some data points about pricing?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. So, as I said in my introductory remarks, we have a product that we sold for years to employers called blueprint for wellness. And we offer it to request employees as well. So, it's a fabulous dipstick reading on an annual basis for people to get an indication what's going on with their health. And if we do it year upon year, you've got a good nice trending capability that I found beneficial since I've been here in question, I know many of our employees have as well and many of our customers. So, we're now using that is the product to introduce that through our direct-to-consumer channel request direct. We're very optimistic about the possibility that this has we believe that it has a unique capability that few others provide. And we also believe it's hitting the market at the right time, where many people have not gone to their primary health care providers. And we believe that there's a lot of opportunities now for people to directly engage with us as a consumer to buy this directly from us. As far as pricing marketing share what we're thinking about in terms of pricing, even though this is a soft launch.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, it's going to be a couple of hundred dollars. And when you look at the individual elements that are contained in here, it's a reasonable price for everything that you get. And I can also tell you that we've gotten a lot of feedback that this score that we give people with really simplifies how to interpret the results is a huge consumer positive. So, a lot of reason to believe that this could get some additional momentum for our consumer business, and we think the pricing is reasonable and we feel that the product we're delivering is something that consumers really find interesting valuable.
Steve Rusckowski: And just to follow-up on the price, we actually did some market research to understand that the value that this provides to consumers justifies the price that we're pricing it for initially. So, we feel good about value delivered and price charged.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark and Shawn. I wanted to continue on the inflation topic, but looked at a different way. If operating costs were to remain elevated, do you think there's an appreciation by payers that the cost of doing business is moving higher? How do you feel about your ability to get price increases? Maybe just talk about recent negotiations.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, but let me start it, Mark, please add. Yes, we've been on this march, as I said in my remarks to continue to demonstrate to our health plan partners, that we continue to deliver value and I believe we make -- we're making tremendous progress. One is that we're picking up access in the number of lives. I mentioned 90% of insured lives are -- we're a network within the United States. And we're happy about the progress of picking some more up this coming year. So, that's moving along. Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up and renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly arise and matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks. So, we're justified, we are getting some modest price increases and we do believe going forward that we can continue to pound that drum. And we are using what other people are using across the United States that in fact, now that we're renting a new inflationary period. Our costs are going up just like yours. And therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward. So, Mark, you'd like to add anything to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Jack, I think you appreciate, I'm sure a lot of people do as well that our health plan contracts typically are three to five years. So, it's not as if every health plan contract is up for renegotiation in any window of time. But so we've been socializing PAMA and how that is changing the dynamic and how they can look at the NLA rates and be competent that, that they have competitive rate because they know what the -- that's the market for the independent labs, which we've said is lower than the market, but the market for the independent labs. So, this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice is going away with PAMA. Now, you add inflation as you suggest and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final. There is one national payer that we've been negotiating and it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them. And certainly my tenure and I'm sure more than a decade. So, we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple years and now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase. And so, how much of its inflation, how much of its PAMA, how much of it is our value proposition and seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus training us as a commoditized provider of laboratory results. Can't tell you, but we're in a much better place.
Steve Rusckowski: Just to remind everyone, our health plan channel business is a significant portion of our revenue every year. But what we've also highlighted, the reason why we do have unit price decreases and our typical assumptions annually is because we have other pressures in our business. We do have break business to physicians, which we call clients and our client business as under price pressure over the past several years. And that has contributed to the price pressure we see. Secondly, as we sell the hospitals and we're doing quite well in the hospital segment, but is price competitive. And then we have other product lines, where we sell our services directly to employers or to insurance companies is price pressure there as well. So, when we talk about our unit price changes, it's not all in the commercial health plan area. There's other area that we have price pressures as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
A.J. Rice: Thanks, everybody. I'm just trying to maybe ask you a high level question about how the pandemic is maybe impacting your business for the long term. It seems like in the pandemic we've seen people move away from just traditional physician office visits at some level virtual care, other alternative sites to get their primary care. Are you seeing and does that help you or hurt you if people go to these other avenues, which may generate testing volume, do you think you capture a disproportionate share of that? And then the other thing, I was going to ask you about the pandemic was related to the -- you've said that if you have outperformance because of COVID testing, you accelerated some of your programs for cost savings and other efficiencies. Should we think of that as just enhancing the visibility on the 3% cost reduction annual goal? Or are there things you're doing that might even present some upside to 2022 and beyond?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, thanks A.J. for your question. Let me take the first one, I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question. First of all, telehealth as we all know has really increased considerably during the pandemic and it has really hit an inflection pouring in in-patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their healthcare delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavioral health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care. So, with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And unfortunately for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work for us with a small group of laboratories. And question would be one of those laboratories. So, we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers, but you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so, when they enter the order, it's going to be into the order of the same way as in the past. So, we're watching it carefully. We do believe it's as a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed in particularly with so many on physicians, by integrated delivery systems. And they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive. So Mark, do you want to take the second part?
Mark Guinan: Yes, actually, A.J. could you repeat that the second part?
Steve Rusckowski: It had to do it accelerating our drive program because of our enhanced performance. And I think he's speaking to some of the acceleration and capital purchases that we've made and spending some additional money to get more improvements than what we would have realized if we didn't have the pandemic. A.J. is that a correct…
A.J. Rice: Still there -- 
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, we have had an opportunity to invest more than we probably would have otherwise given the stronger growth than we would have anticipated in 2021. We've talked about that. A lot of that investment has actually been more towards top line acceleration. So, we've talked about, what we're doing in advanced diagnostics, we talked about what we're doing, what requires to build a consumer business. So, I'd say a disproportionate amount of the opportunity, as we try to balance near term results with longer-term, value accretion has really been in top line. But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient – into more state-of-the-art, probably faster than we normally would have cycled. So, that'll give us some efficiency that maybe wouldn't have otherwise. So, I wouldn't -- at this point suggest that we're ready to commit to more than the 3% productivity, because obviously that's the large number of unit of itself and small basis points changes are really significant. But directionally, I would say, yes, A.J., this pandemic goal was of value accretion in additional cash has enabled us to accelerate some investments. Most of it on the top line growth, but certainly some on the productivity side as well.
Operator: Next up is Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. So, I just want to talk about the base volume trends. I know revenue was up versus 2019, but can you give us some color on how much your based volume trends are still down versus pre-pandemic, maybe ex some of the PLS deals that you've signed during the pandemic, and if it's still down maybe just to give a geographic breakdown and I guess my second question would be obviously testing was a very strong for molecular PCR test for COVID-19. Can you give us a breakdown, how much of that was contributed to like this back to life initiative, whether it's schools, cities, states more like maintenance testing, and I know you said in your prepared remarks that you assume revenue per test goes down in Q4. Can you give us what it was in Q3 and maybe just directionally what we should model for Q4? That would be very helpful. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. Thanks, Ann. Mark, why don't you just start with giving the numbers on base business performance system there.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, hopefully, I can clarify, base volume in total is obviously anything on COVID-related as we've been through the pandemic, we've been recording strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our PLS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization, in the absence of independence way to measure that. We look at our base volume ex, the acquired volume and facts the new PLS deals. And we've talked about that continuing to improve in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So, in June, the organic base volumes and the new PLS deal was getting close to back to the 2019 levels. And then it kind of stabilized in August – in July, and it took a little bit of a step in August. And then as we see where we are through September and into October, it's getting back again, very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22, that we'd be fully recovered. Now, it is regionally, very variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region, as we're looking at Florida in the south, the volume trends are above, and then a couple other areas that are kind of in that middle point. And then the one area of note that's really been lagging is the east, and it continues to lag while it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago. It's still down and kind of an outlier especially in the five boroughs of New York City. And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back to life. So, we're still around $90 in the quarter. We're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back to life really, really took off, which is not, what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a row, but again, it's still net positive. It's just math. So, you can expect for your modeling purposes, that just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance.
Steve Rusckowski: And the last question Ann, you had asked for the breakdown of what we describe is, first of all, the clinical portion of our PCR volumes versus return to life portion of our clinical volumes. And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly particularly, which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return to life. We see the infection rates coming down and we see programs that we've worked on going up, examples are the return to school programs, we mentioned 20 states and five more coming. We also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So, we'll see some increase in testing related to again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that. So, I would say trending wise, it is a larger percentage than before, but it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we received. But we think what we've provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22.
Operator: Next up is Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Hey, good morning. Thanks. First, just a quick follow-up on a comment you made, can you give us a sense of how much flu testing you do a year, if that's what you're anchoring for baseline COVID testing going forward. And then separately, I was just hoping you could talk about COVID reimbursement and the outlook of that for next year? Obviously, you mentioned PHG got extended at least for the early part of next year, if that continues to expand, if you expect reimbursement to be better than what you assumed in that $8 EPS for next year? And then also, what about commercial pricing specifically for COVID is that that tied to PHG? Or help us understand sort of how that's negotiated and if there's a step down there for next year? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want start with the flu?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, it was quite a bit there, Ralph, we'll see if we can touch on all of them. So, we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate. So, the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our fleet revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than what the otherwise is. There's not a ton of molecular testing done. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. And even though the molecular is more precise, they feel that it gets good enough in the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it. So, I would probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as in the commercial rates, that as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what we're being paid by the federal government. So, it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rates from the health emergency. So, there's some other risks as well, but as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then, obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect a negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. So, when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so, again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear, we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 and $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last six months or so. And some of that is probably going to be partially offset if not largely offset by labor inflation. So, we're still pretty much where we were back in March. So, in the higher end of the $748, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we've shared with you at Investor Day, and so, just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be.
Operator: Next question comes from Matt Larew, William Blair. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good Morning, Matt.
Matt Larew: Yes. Hi, good morning. So, a number of questions around labor issues, I actually want to ask about supply chain. I'm just curious if you're starting to see any challenges in sourcing anything, either for your PSCs or the labs, either longer lead times, and then if you're having any issues with the sample transport logistics?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, so far Matt we're keeping up, we always have battles here and there, even despite the pandemic with supplies got a complicated business and a lot of pieces have to come together to do what we do, but not a meaningful disruption so far, but we're watching it carefully because we're not through this yet. So, the last part of this is around logistics and again, logistics have become a little more complicated given we do use commercial carriers for some portion of our logistics, but we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of carriers. We have about 3,500 carriers and automobiles that are request employees. We have a fleet of small airplanes through some of the connections between our collection locations and our laboratories and they're employed by us. And so we're happy we had those in these uncertain times and we continue to have strong relationships with the national carriers as well, so far so good.
Operator: Next up is Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Peter.
Pito Chickering: Hi, good morning guys. I follow-up on Ann's question around the base testing business, once you exclude M&A and POS, can you give us color on where the tests are coming in from specifically looking at primary care visits versus specialty visit versus hospital visits? Just curious if hospitals slowdown in fourth quarter with the COVID surge, does it impact anything on your fourth quarter growth?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, first off, Pito to be clear, the utilization trend that I talked about being nearly fully recovery doesn't exclude all POS, it just since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently. So, that we don't cloud what we think utilization is. So, we had a PLS business of size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out, because obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So, when you look at the sources, we've shared that -- the recovery has been pretty broad based. There's not a lot of differences especially now, early in the pandemic there were some we talked about for certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven, a lot -- some of that, not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed and certainly we've seen the toxicology or prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as a return to trading patients for elective surgeries and so on, physician office was a little more lagging, but at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong and we're seeing the volumes especially in some of the regions above where they were in 2019. So, we don't feel other than the east that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically.
Operator: Next up is Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Tycho.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Casey on for Tycho. Two quick ones for you guys, the first one, do you think that the increased cash spent per requisition or test density trends that you've called out in 2021 will continue into 2022. And is that baked into that $7.40 to $8 EPS outlook. And then my second one is just on capital deployment. You guys have completed the ASR, right? So should we expect any more buybacks in 4Q and what share account should we use for our model for 4Q? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, I'll take the first one. Mark, you take the second and versus on rec density that is the number of tests per requisition. We assume there's a lot of different moving parts as you know for our business. One of which is the mix of tests. The second is number of tests for requisition being able to we have channel mix changes. So, all of that is complicated in our outlook that we've provided. So, we assume that that's in there. And Mark, you want to talk about capital deployment question?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, the ASR should be wrapped up sometime in the next 30 days. So, therefore for at this point, even we did additional purchases once the window opens and not committing to anything at this point, because we always say there's a balance between potential M&A and share repurchases. It wouldn't have a significant impact on our way so this year. So, any sort of additional purchases of our shares repurchases would be more of an impact for 2022. And obviously, we'll talk about that in detail when we come up to the guidance for 2022 early next year.
Operator: Next up is Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Derik.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is   on for Derek. I wanted to dig into the base business growth specifically within your advanced diagnostic business. Was there any notable trend for cancer and genetic testing, if you could comment on the growth trajectory that'd be great?
Steve Rusckowski: John, in our remarks, we're pleased with the recovery we've seen in advanced diagnostics and remind everyone that our definition of advanced diagnostics are entirely molecular and genetics. And when I say recovery and I did say molecular, it does not include our COVID testing. So, it's our base, if you will, molecular and genetic testing. And we saw very good growth in beyond recovery for our prenatal testing feel good about that. And we are seeing nice growth for our genetics business. And as you recall, we did an acquisition with blueprint genetics last year, and that's progressing nicely and give us some nice growth and strength in that business. So, we feel good about the recovery and growth we're seeing in those areas that we're really focused on and genetics in general is one of those areas.
Operator: Next up is Mike Newshel, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Mike.
Mike Newshel: Hey, thanks. So, do -- there's a labor and inflation costs issues you have talked about that you can absorb in your 2022 outlook. Does that have any change in the long-term sort of growth targets that you laid out for post 2022 in terms of earnings growth?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, I -- at this point, obviously we have a broad range, but I would say that just like we've done in other periods of time. We'll look for and identify offsets to that. So, I -- it's not significant enough that we should deviate on a multi-year outlook in terms of our earnings growth being in the high-single digits, and we -- although we have identified everything over the next several years. I'm sure as we move through time we'll look for other productivity opportunities to offset some of that.
Operator: There are no more questions.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay, very good. So, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your continued support and everyone have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. 
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic’s impact on the US health care system and the US economy and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for being us today. We had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster than expected recovery in our base business. Organic based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. Compared to 2019, our base CIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter and it was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. Importantly, compareto our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were … We discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business and the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we had another strong quarter with a faster than expected recovery in our base business. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months. And then finally, I'd like to thank all Quest employees and the team to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator:  Our first question from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities.
Ann Hynes: I just have a question on -- I think you just said your guidance assumes about 20,000 molecular tests per day. Is that average for the entire second half or is that exiting the year? Also, can you just talk about what your guidance assumes for any kind of labor and inflation pressures for the second half? And do you see that those getting worse or are they stable throughout the year?
Mark Guinan: So Ann, at 20,000 is not the exit rate, it is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance. To get to the middle part of guidance, we would expect somewhat stronger than 20,000, of course there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing and then a stronger base business recovery more in the mid single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimentionalize the range for you. In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that and we responded to it and that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: I guess my question for you, Steve. As we think about the PLN and the preferred networks, it sounds like we're seeing some progress there. But any color you can give us on the recovery and the uptake and the traction you're getting there, especially as we exit the COVID drag.
Steve Rusckowski: So we're feeling about the programs we've put in place over the last couple of years, Brian. We started these with United, as you know. And then we mentioned that we have a program that we're working with Anthem across the country, so we feel good about. We continue to work on the programs with other payers that see this as an opportunity as well. And what I said in my remarks, we do see those payers and the volume going through those payers growing faster than our other base recovery. So we feel we're actually getting some traction where everything was put in place. And I can tell you the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high quality low cost value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we describe as for lab network. And it's really all about what we've talked about in my remarks around the triple aim and primarily in affordable care. So good progress. What we've done already is making advance in the opportunity and we see more opportunities in front of us.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the base business recovery. Was it fairly linear since the end of March to the commentary you made around June? And then was curious if you're seeing any sort of pent-up demand and whether you thought that might have helped the trajectory? Any commentary around test per acquisition that would be helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: So we are seeing a nice step by step improvement in base business. I would say it's been a nice recovery over the sequence of the first half. You remember we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat around high single digits and kind of improved throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And there's different ways we look at it what is the clinical cost and we actually see good recovery in our general health business or current  business. I mentioned in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic  testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat of a laggard, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels but it's coming along. And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country of the after ‘19 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn -- we started to move in the right direction, Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just been happening. And we're hopeful as the opening continues as people get back into life within that’s happening in New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question you started with it has more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: The only thing I'll add, Jack, is that it is somewhat uneven even though it has been steady nationally. And we do have a couple of regions that are actually back to the volume growth we had in those first couple of months of 2020 before the pandemic. So that's why we're feeling good not just about utilization recovery, we're really good about getting back and working on the things with our key partners such as the PLN and other relationships that we've called out with some of the payers around value based contracting and then really continuing to have our strong relationships with hospital systems. And we've talked about how much progress we've made around POS. So the good news is that things are open for business. We're able to go back in to the offices, not completely, but much more than we were over the last 12 months plus. And therefore, we're getting back to what we were doing before the pandemic started.
Jack Meehan: And was there anything relating to pent-up demand that you saw?
Steve Rusckowski: You know it’s hard to tease out. What we talked about in our calculation of revenue per req is that we are seeing more tests per requisition. So one could assume that some of that is tag on the test because the divisions show a step up in the office and they haven't been there for 16 months. So hard to tell, you got to believe there's a little bit of that in my prepared remarks as people return and catch up on pre-pandemic levels. But we’ve also, to Mark's point, that we’ve done into '19 but remember when we started '20, we have some nice growth in the first couple of months. So we've got more opportunities in front of us to continue to recover and also build on top of what we see to gain that share we're planning for.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Just a quick follow-up and then sort of my main question. Just on the follow-up, you mentioned that you renewed the Aetna contract. So just wanted to understand how should we see the remodel, how should we think about the pricing impact for the next 12 months? And then when we think about the value based programs that you're now signing with payers. I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you’re seeing these value based relationships and mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also what's the framework, are you sharing upside from the savings or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want to talk about what’s in…
Mark Guinan: So first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value based programs and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. So it's more focused on commercial, although obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the  commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them but really they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab like ourselves relative to out of network providers or in some cases other high cost providers in network, obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves pay money, and then we earn upside to a base level contract. And that base contract is not at a discount, it's really been kind of a historical level. So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that we're part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. So that's really the elements we shared. Steerage when they give us list of accounts where a lot of efforts going to out of network or higher cost providers. We go in with their support, calling those to educate for the people who have  plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit that's fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. And then we talked about M&A incentives where in the past when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing it and fall to our price, obviously, and the huge windfall to the payers but that it's good for them if we buy outreach and therefore, instead of taking that debt immediately, maybe a step down in those rates and we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just like every one of the major payer contracts. So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that when we're successful and they're successful together we can do more of that and therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and driven improvement for their members.
Ricky Goldwasser: So just one follow-up on the upside payment to base levels. So should we think about that now that sort of at the end of the year as you calculated by the upside, we could see upside to numbers from payments at the end of the year, or is this something that would just kind of flow through on a quarterly basis?
Mark Guinan: Well, I'll address the two examples I gave. So in the steerage one, where we're moving work, it's really more quarterly. So it's a constant look at that. We have a formula for doing that and then we're reimbursed more regularly. It's not a once a year catch-up and that's much better for us for a lot of reasons, not just for more regular rev rec but also for accounting purposes and so on for both of us, that's a better approach. On the M&A, obviously, that would be somewhat invisible to you. Because when we do a deal what it just means is that we get paid more than we would have historically a little bit with some of a premium over what our negotiated rates would be for the volume that clearly has moved from that hospital system to us, the hospital outreach business. So you’re not going to really see that. Again, that's going to be a regular monthly quarterly thing, not a catch up.
Operator: Our next question now is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: So you mentioned PAMA in the prepared remarks, and looks like the cuts are likely to restart next year. Maybe just remind us the headwind. And then at your Analyst Day, you suggested an EPS range for 2022 and kind of pointed to the higher end, I think, closer to an $8 number. Just wanted to confirm that, that assumed PAMA was coming back. And then just your comments on incremental investments that you talked about in the back half. Just wondering does that change anything related to that $8 number that we should be thinking about for 2022?
Steve Rusckowski: Let me start with PAMA. So remember we said in our remarks we're filing hard to get a better answer on PAMA. And so hopefully, that was clear in the remarks. We do believe that the MedPAC report, those gave us some data that suggests that we were right with saying that if you collected all the data, it was representative that there will be a 10% to 15% reduction in the rates versus what we see now. And we obviously have some work to work with reduction in the price cost, not a reduction in the clinical outreach, just to make that clear, an increase of 10% to 15%. And in that regard, we have some work to do to get that through congress because it's going to be a legislative fix but we're going to keep on pushing on that. But with all that said what I'll keep on saying is we're assuming worst case in our outlook that in '22, we'll see another top. So that's clear. And then Mark, do you want to talk a little bit on the range and where are we pointed to at Investor Day.
Mark Guinan: So what I would say is that I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business. And at some point, we all hoped COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested , and what we were saying is based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that . PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it’s still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing and we don't know everything but certainly, we know our prices and we've shared that we’ve really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that while there might be some cuts with the recalculation they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years.
Steve Rusckowski: And we continue to feel good about the investments we're allowed to make on the additional resources. We talked about at Investor Day, about $75 million worth of investments. We talked today that continues in the back half of the year, that’s guidance in the outlook or the guidance we provided. And it's entirely consistent with what we teed up at Investor Day and on our growth platforms. We're investing in both self plans relationships with hospital opportunities we see. We see opportunities to accelerate advanced diagnostics. We feel good about the recovery we've seen there and then also the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer initiated testing. So our performance is allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to the outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is the 4% to 5% top line growth in high single digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments and we're are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money and it's included in the guidance in the back half.
Mark Guinan: And then the revenue as well. So some of these are several years in the coming in terms of the return and some of them we get much more immediate. On consumer, we've talked about potential $0.25 million business by 2025, that's coming from small  before the pandemic. And so you could imagine that with some of the things we're doing, we're going to be building significant incremental revenue to get to that $250 million over the next couple of years. It's not going to all come in the last year or something like that. So we're getting revenue growth upside as well for those investments, not just incremental expense.
Operator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Two quick follow-up questions here. On the 2021 guidance, you quantified the COVID assumptions and base business assumptions for the low end of guidance. Can you quantify the same levels for the midrange and the high range guidance? And just to clarify on the last question, the investments that you're making this year, does this continue into 2022 and beyond? Are they onetime in nature or do you have to add additional investments next year?
Mark Guinan: So I didn't intend to quantify with specificity been at high end, because it's a multivariable equation. So what I wanted to do was make clear the low end for a lot of reasons. You can imagine, we wanted to make people understand how we might get to that low end. And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards so it's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned this pandemic is all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the celta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that are 95% plus deliverable or even more. So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite direction. It's kind of harder to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day, we anticipate for the balance year significantly lower than we're getting right now. As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with obviously delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overact the short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every two weeks. So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook to make clear what those assumptions are and especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every two weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of net outlook range that I laid out this morning.
Steve Rusckowski: As far as the investments, some of the investments are temporal within '21. But as you would expect, we're investing in long term capabilities that will continue into '22. But rest assured that to be reapplied business case and the revenues associated would be there as well. So yes, we will have the outlook assumptions, we'll have some portion of these investments to '22 and trust that those investments are investments for us to do that.
Mark Guinan: And back to Ralph's question, again, I want to emphasize those were built into the outlook that I provided in Investor Day. So we've tried to make clear that we see these growth opportunities. The COVID revenue upside give us the opportunity not just to deliver some record earnings for the last couple of quarters but actually to invest and accelerate the long term prospects for our base business. So we thought it was the right balance between near term delivery results as well as the long term growth of the business. And so when I gave you that multiyear outlook for years and then when I frame 2022, those all fully contemplated these investments.
Pito Chickering: So then just on that one, is it fair to say that you are reiterating the number today for 2022?
Mark Guinan - CFO: Yes, so nothing's changed. So we would feel compelled if there was something over the last six months that would cause us to feel that, that range was no longer appropriate. We will take some of it, absolutely.
Operator: Our next question now is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.
Tim Daley: This is actually Tim Daley on for Dan. So I just wanted to dig a bit more on Pito's question. So I believe the back to school total opportunity has framed as upside in relation to the guidance for the second half of the year. So first, I just wanted to clarify, is there any back to school testing baked into the COVID guidance or company level ranges discussed? And then secondly, given we are kind of weeks away from kids heading back to school. I'm sure there's been some discussions, but could you give us some insight into the internal on the ground discussions happening? Like are there broad based general screening plans for back to school and maybe a big one off push at the start of the year? Just any more additional color there would be really helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: So Mark just laid out expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return to life testing would go off and a portion of that return to life has to do back to school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with two programs that are funded with the funding for testing. One is the 600 million program for return to school programs where we have partners to help us with that and school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program come up. And then there's a larger program to about $10 billion. But as you can understand, I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. And so they're going to start ramping up soon than into the month of August and in September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States and who does what, when. And I do believe that given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. And also return to office programs, we do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think clearly, there's been heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant so far in the last week or two. So hopefully, I’ve provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far.
Mark Guinan: I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about the PCR test today where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with the numbers are as well, our methodology is a heavily pulled approach. We pull a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positive regions for economic reasons. But it's our responsibility if we are positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pull too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they’re not even identified. So what happens is the collections done, the entity, in this case, the school, knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it and we say this is negative hopefully. And in the case where it's positive then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order. That's a separate payment, et cetera. And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because the economies can be kept with this huge coin, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR vessel. So the volumes have to be 10 fold at the same dollar values for our top line. So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won, we’ve got some of that volume. But to really move the needle it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding there, to this point, we've seen some momentum but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months.
Operator: Our next question now is from Derrick Brown with Bank of America.
Derrick Brown: So twp quick questions. Just a little bit more color on the recovery in the base business, just are you seeing anything in particular in terms of oncology and esoteric versus routine testing? Just a little bit more color on that. You gave some geographical differences, but I'd love some mixed differences. And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast, you're guiding to -- we just got off the  and they're talking about, they went from 10 million point of care tests in the first to 14 million point of care tests in the second quarter. So one of the question we continue to get on the central lab is the impact longer term on the business on point of care testing, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point of care and at home space. So I'd love to hear your general thoughts on sort of your spot on volume shifts to certain applications into the point of care market? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Let me start with the first one. So what we said is our general health and our cardio metabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our general diagnostics and I would say the industry sometimes is also -- routine type of prognostic and that’s in the United States and that’s recovered there. Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen some recovery at our AP business and pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric has actually recovered nicely, and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plan. So we feel good about that. And the second question, which has to do with point of care. And when I say point of care, the PCR point of care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place that we would return to work programs related to testing and some of the point of care applications. Well equally what you see with our volumes somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we report our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflex back to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure, questionable negative metric not the false negative. So we do believe we did a good place in the marketplace and we do believe there is point of care devices, including the antigen as well as PCR going forward.
Operator: Our next question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Julia on for Tycho today. A lot of my questions have been answered already. So just following up on an earlier question about your payer program. It's great to see that you're having success with United and Anthem and recently with new contract with Aetna as well. You previously said the volume through these relationships are growing faster than the rest of your book. Just curious if you can provide some additional color on how much faster these volumes are growing? And what kind of investments you are making to capitalize on these opportunities?
Mark Guinan: So as you might imagine, there's not an answer to how much faster because they're not all equal. And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared with Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at different rates. So if you assume that payer there, more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas. So Florida, I would say, or even California. So we've looked at, because it's one of our key -- you know, we have a full process, we call the  and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for our saying that we're growing faster. So you know in this business a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be half a percent or double digit kind of differential. But couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first two months of 2020. So line of the business utilization becomes fully recovered what happen is that we'll get back to that, not just historical growth of market but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multiyear outlook at Investor Day.
Steve Rusckowski: And as far as investments, what Mark said is everyone plans all the detail, plan of what we're going to do to gain that share. And some of that happens nationally and some of it happens locally and some of it happens by line of business. So we do have some programs to go with the payer to grow national talents and their plan sponsors and plan sponsors. And so a lot of that is local. And so you asked the question where we're making investments. We'll put those investment dollars where we think we need extra capacity to drive those programs by payer. And there's a lot of variation around where those opportunities are by payer and that detail is what we're speaking to when we talked about investments in the health plans.
Mark Guinan: I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology in perspective of monitoring. The payers as that is starting to grow and there was some concern the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. And so we went for some of the payers, talked to them about that and said, hey, not only is that not right for us, it's not right for the patient, because it's going to be make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good less. And when I say it's not just certainly our chief competitor and some others are just like us, they're very responsible. We do good work and tops calling prescription monitoring. So they put in rules in place where we're actually vented from pre-op. So that's another example where it's really not an investment, it's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these rules and behaviors. But again, as an example where we're benefiting but so are the patients and a lot of other people, because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing.
Operator: Our last question now is from Matt Larew with William Blair.
Matt Larew: So the Clifton lab went live in January and Steve, I think you said the consolidation from it will wrap up here next month. In the past you talked about sort of doubling throughput, 30% more capacity, I think 50% increase in productivity. Just curious if there are any data points to share so far on how the consolidation is going, and how we should think about the impact to margins as volumes consolidated into Clifton?
Steve Rusckowski: So we're pleased with what we're able to do. It's pretty remarkable that we built this facility in the middle of the pandemic and for all intents and purposes that are on track and it's up and running. And we bring in this facility to do that consolidation, we have to continue our program around organizational processes and harmonization around systems to get them all in the same platform within the new facility. So we're on the final strokes of that implementation, we feel good about it. And then in that facility, we have implemented a lot of the new systems we've been in place for our new immunoassay platform from Siemens, we talked about, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good gains for them and more to come. We’ll put in place new front end automation and through the lab automation with our partner Inpeco. And actually, Siemens has done the systemization with that as well. So we are pleased with the progress made so far and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to burn in systems and work out some of the early details and those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program and that are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day.
Matt Larew: Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by: the pandemic’s severity and duration; healthcare-insured, government, and client-payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic’s impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company’s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a strong first quarter with our base businesses to continuing to recover the near pre-pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business and helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the US exits the pandemic and people return to normal activities and address the routine care issues that have been neglected over the past year.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services into a lesser extent continued recovery in our base testing revenue, which increased versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new POS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year; base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. Our base business continues to recover back to near pre-pandemic levels as people address the routine care issues that they have neglected over the past year. And then finally, I'd just like to thank all Quest employees who continue to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. And so with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Caliendo: Yeah. Good morning. So I guess, some of the commentary around 2Q, I sort of want to understand the expectation, it looked like March, the base business was up year-over-year, and your guidance is suggesting that 2Q would be down year-over-year. You don't expect it to recover fully. Is there anything that changed, or was March an anomaly, sort of, take us through what you're seeing in the base business in terms of the volumes?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So Kevin, when we talk about the base business, and sorry for any confusion, it being up in March. That included our new PLS wins, which were significant and also M&A. So it's the total base business that was not an organic number. What we tried to do was delineate where the -- what we call same-store, so kind of the apples and apples versus 2019 to give you a sense of where we think utilization is. So separate from new significant PLS wins and M&A where that base business performance is. So when we talk about expecting to be slightly down in Q2, that's that organic non-PLS utilization, same store number, not our total base business performance.
Steve Rusckowski: So Mark, it’d be good to share our implied view on what's going to happen COVID testing in Q2.
Mark Guinan: Yeah. So we talked about 100,000 a day in Q1. We talked about an expectation about 50,000, we also shared that we exited Q1 over 70,000, so that would imply a significant ramp down throughout the second quarter. And that's based on our expectation that vaccines will continue to roll out, we'll get more and more people who'll be protected and less and less clinical demand. And of course, we'll see how that plays out, but that is certainly within the guidance that we're providing today, how we see the next several months.
Steve Rusckowski: So if you assume Kevin, our base business, it would include acquisitions in PLS and organic growth. But let's just focus on organic growth. The steady improvement that we've seen in Q1 continues in Q2. And then it's somewhat offset by what we are anticipating with COVID, and that gives us the expectation around ranges of guidance in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Mark Guinan: Yeah. And just to close it out, Kevin, I would point to the numbers that we quoted for Q1 of minus 7%. That's the same-store performance number. And we -- obviously, March was stronger than that. February was impacted by weather, as we said. But that -- we expect that minus 7% to improve, as Steve said, throughout Q2, but not yet to get positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Erin.
Erin Wright: Capital deployment is still one of the biggest questions we're getting from investors, are there any meaningful changes now in your view from an M&A pipeline perspective? And what's assumed in guidance in terms of inorganic growth? And longer term, here over the next few years, do you anticipate the pace of consolidation across the lab industry to accelerate, or do you anticipate a similar pace to what we've seen historically? And just somewhat tied to that as well, I mean, how should we be thinking about the broader excess capacity across the competitive landscape post-COVID? And how does that impact your positioning?
Mark Guinan: Hey, Steve, let me take the guidance question first, and then I'll turn it over to you. So Erin, our current guidance, obviously, is only through the second quarter, and we're not counting on any M&A that hasn't already been transacted. And even the deal that we announced Mercy is not going to close and generate any significant volume or revenue in the second quarter. So the current guidance does not anticipate future M&A. Steve?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So we feel good about the discussions and the funnel of prospects we have for what we have characterized as our hospital strategy. There continues to be a lot of pressure on these pre-delivery systems. They are considering their last strategy is one of the options to help them. And we have a number of examples over the past six months on delivering on the strategies that we've talked about for years. And so the answer to your question, we do see a continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that, we historically have delivered on that at the three years prior to 2021. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year, and going forward, it's implied in our outlook for growth. So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care on consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them. And what's your strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, we see, if you will, fewer and fewer in network providers with the health clients. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those two forces happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Within the routine market, can you give us some more color on strength and weaknesses in different parts of the country? Looking at your customers, can you give us some color on dock offices versus hospitals versus the baseline and their routine tests? Any details you can give us on what types of test are normalizing and sort of what are the laggard areas?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. Sure. So let me take a run around all the different customers the way we look at the market. So geographically, we have seen good recovery in Texas and the South West. We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and bring us back to the 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. Now the offset to that is long as you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens in the lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health through delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of that, let’s say, in the Midwest. And then finally the Northeast and the Northeast including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing. As far as physician business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see remissions getting back to 2019 levels. We see outpatient procedures getting back to 2019 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what type of physician. Primary care is starting to turn on oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were at 2019. And that's an issue that varies by state to work in that. So that gives you a feel for what's going geographically. What's going on by physician, but also by what we described as clinical franchises. Mark, anything you’d like to add to that?
A – Mark Guinan: No, I think that's a good summary, Steve. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. The higher revenue guidance, just want to understand, is that upside from 1Q? Because it sounded like COVID was maybe lower than you had expected. So just trying to understand if it reflects assumption of better core, or is it deals? Just maybe color there, reconciling the higher revenue? And then second, is the ASR included in the guidance? Because just based on the revenue increase and running through recent margin performance, it doesn't look like that's factored in, or otherwise, there would be an assumption of much lower margin. So I'm just trying to reconcile that as well. Thanks.
A – Mark Guinan: Yes. So let me take a shot at that, Ralph, thanks. The higher revenue is absolutely driven by stronger-than-expected recovery in the base business. So as you point out, we've acknowledged and we record every couple of weeks, COVID testing has ramped down faster than we had anticipated throughout the first quarter. We continue to expect to have that ramp down, but the base business has recovered stronger, is most certainly more than an offset on the revenue side. In terms of the ASR, it is in the guidance. I just want to remind everyone that we have had committed to $900 million in share repurchases that was already in the guidance for the first half. We did $410 million in Q1. And then part of the ASR is related to the proceeds from the sale of our 40% ownership in our JV with IQVIA, and that is slightly accretive when you consider the loss of the equity earnings. So you need to look at over $600 million of the ASR as really offsetting the -- foregoing those equity earnings. We had already committed to $900 million in the previous guide in the first half, so almost $500 million there. So when you combine that, the share repurchases are really just up by several hundred million. So I want to make sure everyone is clear on the math there. So it is reflected in the guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys, congrats on the quarter. I guess, my question for you guys, Steve as you think about what you saw in Q1, specifically in March with the assumption of volumes in the core. What are you seeing in terms of acuity levels, like rep number of tests per req, or even revenue per req that you saw in March, is that carrying over already into April, just any color you can share with us on that? Thank you. 
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So thanks, appreciate the question. Mark was encouraging, and we're watching April, carefully. And we do look at the number of test per requisition to see if we're getting more density, if you will, of testing for requisition, and we talked about new made explanation for increase in the calculation of revenue per req have to do with the COVID test, the straight calculation. But we have historically seen a, let's say, modest expansion of the newer test for variety of reasons, we offer more. Second, there is a higher level of acuity and chronic disease and aging of the population. So we have generally seen a general increase in that. But nothing that was really notable that's standing out within March.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Good morning. I was wondering, if you could give us an update around your thinking around COVID testing for the second half of the year? What do you expect in terms of, the base in terms of testing levels, and then also if you can give us an update as to how you think the school testing opportunity could shake out your reference that at the beginning. How do you feel your positioning is for the upcoming awards there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So you go back to where we started off the year. What we said is we do expect COVID, PCR testing to decline throughout the year and we mentioned in our remarks, you could see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend in Q2 and that will continue into the second half. Now with a little bit offset, we do see this transition from what we described as more clinical uses of the PCR testing, roll in and roll out COVID for hospitals, roll in, roll out patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return to life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity, I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's two funding mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well-positioned there. Secondly, is corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return to work activities. And then let me just say the entertainment piece of this is big, too. We see the sports teams, want to put paints back in the stands. We see New York City, interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city, we mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check, if you will provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in this nature. And also, we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue in 2022. This is not going away fast.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Matt.
Matt Larew: Thanks for – yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe a two part. The first would just be a follow-up to Jack's question, Steve, in terms of how much of that return to life testing opportunity really is going to be in a sort of a reference lab setting with the day or to turnaround time versus a point-of-care setting. But my question though was about the consumer market. I just wanted to get your take on sort of the PWN Everlywell combination and if that changes any of your approach or the competitive dynamics in that space?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing, sensitivity and specificity has been for let's say day two through day five of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rollout, if someone has been exposed in the early days, there were rule out the pick are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physician sell that, and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part of how we fight this pandemic. As far as the consumer, the consumers trying to figure out to get easy access to testing, and they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround time is now for PCR testing are much better on average than the two-ish days that we often thought about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than the day for many – for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CVS has gone quite well. CVS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends and Walmart as well. And then also with our direct to the Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting collection kit in the mail and a FedEx envelope to ship that back and good turnaround tied to start up of MyQuest. So that will continue to build, as the consumers -- as we start to return to life in a safe way. I want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or they have natural immunity, we are not locking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways that they fell through the cracks with all the caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity, and then also, with the new variance as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of good chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half.
Mark Guinan: Yeah. And Steve, I'd like to add. I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly, because we're going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is, it's not a diagnostic, because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have tool that they will know in test through that who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to retest. Whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples, so it actually is an inefficiency in our process. In order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entity that we had a positive in one of the pooled collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning. Hey, Tycho.
Mark Guinan: Tycho, you’re on mute.
Steve Rusckowski: You’re on mute
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Sorry about that. This is Casey in for Tycho. Can you give us some color as to what the implied operating margin is for the EPS guide? And sort of what's the upside is from the ASR? And then just on serology, can you talk a little bit about you're not modeling a decrease in 2Q from 1Q, but PCR is going down. Can we assume the same level of serology testing throughout the back half of the year and explain maybe what the resilience is there? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want to talk the ASR?
Mark Guinan: Well, the ASR is in our updated guidance. So there's not upside per se relative to before we announced the ASR, as I tried to walk through the math, about a little less than $400 million of the repurchases are truly incremental in terms of an EPS lift, because we had already committed to the full $900 million, and we had about $500 million remaining in Q2 that was already in the guidance. So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q2, that's slightly accretive. But not materially relative to the -- for mature of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But the offset to that is the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery, certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Serology, we imply that it will continue at the same level. We are pushing on the value of serology going forward. We believe that the semi-quant capability that we offer has nice insight into what response is happening in patients in general with the virus and therefore, that has value. We also believe that between historic PCR and serology, knowing that you've had the viruses important for Americans to know so. We keep on pushing down the value, and we will continue to look at new tests beyond that. We will be immune response long-term includes T cells. We don't have that, but we continue to look at that has been the prospect. So you should assume for now it's stable with what we've seen so far, but we continue to believe that's more and more valuable in the quarter. We continue to work on developing the test to support that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So two questions because I wanted to follow-up. So when we think about the first half guidance, it does imply that meaningful operating income sequential decline. I fully realize you're still not giving second half guidance. But just to maybe everybody on the call, sort of -- some, sort of, a framework as we think about a more normalized pace of the core business. How should we think about that margin headwind? I think it's just going to help us all as we think about the second half modeling. That's first. And then second, more is like long-term strategically. We're hearing the payers talk a lot about digital-first strategies and being like the front door to health care you guys talked about expanding relationship with payers like Anthem. So are you having any conversations with payers on how you can be part of that digital-first strategy in those digital networks? And if so, do you see that as an opportunity to accelerate more narrow networks that will drive volume toward you, and actually, would that require any additional investments or you think you have the infrastructure for that already?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you take the first one, I'll take the second one.
Mark Guinan: Sure, Steve. Thanks for the Ricky. Again, just to reiterate, the first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at an Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level, pre-pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by 700 basis points. So we feel very confidence in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble, where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year, and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic once COVID testing drops to a minimal level. We'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. Just to transition. So as you recall in our Investor Day, we went to a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for 2022. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering, and we'll get growing – going forward in 2022 based upon our outlook. So the last question you add, Rick, you have to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like the Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow because from a disposition perspective, that allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to fewer players. And then secondly is this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will of telehealth, it has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end, be an accepted way to first engage with the healthcare that this system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners. So who are those partners? Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies, as they become much more indebted in healthcare delivery, let's call the digital equipment , will rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the deferred lab network that we are ready with United, but for this new world that we see. And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well, because consumers equally are wanting to engage with upgrade delivery. They not always need to engage with this physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business and the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves, if you will, which is a big opportunity for us. As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and 2021. If you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period over the last two years, 2020 and 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so, we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward, because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they can only do it with a select group like us. So we have another question?
Shawn Bevec: Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi. Good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Derik.
Derik de Bruin: Thanks for taking the question. Hey. So two questions. One is, I was on the Danaher call just before this, and they actually pretty sharply raised their COVID testing guidance for the year and also surprisingly gave a very bullish outlook for 2022 and sort of backing that number. So I think the first question goes to, is some of the -- this is a question on the point-of-care shifting from decentralized testing, shifting to point of care. Is some of the volume you're seeing coming down just because there are more of these point-of-care platforms out there and just as they ramp capacity, you're seeing volume shifting out of the central lab? That's the first question. And then I think the second question is, when you look at your -- you're at 100,000-ish test, you've got 300,000 capacity. How are you using -- how do you utilizing that capacity? Is it more -- are you ramping down your IVD platforms versus your LDT platforms? Just to assume that it's more of the IVD, because the LDTs are more profitable. But just would love some idea on sort of like how you're utilizing your installed base. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So the first part, yes, we did see an increase in the availability and use of the antigen testing and point-of-care testing throughout the last 12 months that clearly has picked up in the back half of 2020. We see that continue in 2021. So if you look at the industry trackers of how much testing we are doing in this country, clearly, it has dropped off, and therefore, volumes have dropped off as well. We believe in those tracking mechanisms, it's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing that’s happening. So if you look at it, look, happy for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the excellence that are coming from least point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR is exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around point-of-care and antigen testing. However, going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where antigen testing can be helpful for a period of time. And also what you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use point-of-care and costs are not all created equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of 2021 and also into 2022.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey, guys, thanks for follow-up question here. Could you give us a little more details on the changes of what the UnitedHealthcare did for out-of-network providers in the quarter, what markets did they make this change in, what impacts did you see in your volumes from these changes? Thanks so much.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. So what we have been working on as a journey to pick up share, if you will, it can be mated what we shared in March at our Investor Day is we really kicked off the network program in 2019. We saw a good progress there. We're actually very encouraged by what we saw in 2020, it's very early days, and then we have the pandemic. But it didn't stop our activity. So what we shared is we actually picked up some share over that period of time, but we have more share to gain. And there's a list of activities we're working with United to support picking up share and getting it to at least that 25% level, one of which is what we're providing is limiting the other network policy and benefit design for their fully insured book. And where that has happened because we have other examples of the topic, it does move share to us. We don't provide specifics on states and specifics on how much did this contribute to share. But it did have a nice impact for us to allow us to pick up share. And so we continue that market. But I'll also share that we didn't share everything we're doing. There are many other programs, and some of this is working with their plan sponsors. Their employers, some of this is working with their regions, specific opportunities with providers. When we do an outreach purchase and relationship within the geography, whose work on expensive venue to a less expensive venue, which is Quest, and all of those are active relationships that we have to continue to build share with United and other payers is equally will continue to work programs with the Anthem and others.
Operator: Our last question comes from Eugene Kim with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hello.
Eugene Kim: Hi, good morning. So quickly on 2022, at the Investor Day, the company provided a baseline EPS range of $7.40 and $8, and I believe fund to the higher end of that range. And that was what assumption that base business recovery return to pre-pandemic levels toward the end of the year. With the potential -- I mean, the recovery come faster than expectation, how should we think about that range that provided at the Investor Day? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark? Hey, Mark you there?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. So the -- what I would say is, I'm not in a position to update that what we provided at Investor Day, because we could get in a rhythm of constantly getting asked to update that. So next time we'll comment will be when we provide guidance for 2022. But of course, as we have that broader range, there's a lot of different considerations, what the remaining level of COVID testing, what's the reimbursement level. Where is the base business at? When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United by Anthem and some of the other major players depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact, I wouldn't say at this point that, the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks is going away. And we were not expecting it to be anywhere near the significance that it was in 2020 and in 2021. So – and then you've got the ASR we just announced. So there's a lot of different moving pieces. So we'll give you an update on 2022, when we provide our guidance for 2022. We just wanted to ground people at Investor Day, because the pandemic really confounded everyone's ability to understand our long-term earnings power, and that's why we thought it was important to make a specific comment on 2022.
Shawn Bevec: Good. So I think we've covered all the questions. We appreciate you joining the call. We appreciate your continued support, and have a great day, everybody. Take care.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic’s severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company’s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So, in the year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country, and delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees and they have responded as heroes, by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results, and of course, supporting our customers.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew approximately 58%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year in October and November. The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high-single-digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, I’d like to thank all Quest employees who have worked tirelessly over the past year. They have delivered a significant portion of the country’s COVID-19 testing, while serving the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Thanks to their heroic efforts, we delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. In light of the company’s strong financial performance, we have increased our dividend and share repurchase authorization while maintaining flexibility to pursue our M&A strategy. We look forward to sharing a more in-depth update on our market views and strategy at our upcoming virtual Investor Day to be held on Thursday, March 11. Stay tuned for additional details on that day. Now, we’d be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I guess – I think I heard you say that you expected molecular reimbursement to trend lower, just wanted to flesh that out to understand that and maybe what have you seen for reimbursement with PHE likely extended for the full-year? And has there been any discussion or thoughts about proactively go into plans and perhaps not continuing to get that sort of inflated PHE reimbursement in exchange maybe for more favorable longer-term pricing escalators? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start it?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, you know, we are expecting, you know, to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates, and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.  So, you know, we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong, but we also recognize the reality, you know, the pressure on the industry, from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers, and so therefore, as we mentioned, you know, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect, you know, some reduction in that reimbursement, not something, you know, that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure. And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's, you know, quite a few labs at this point, given the demand that have significant capacity. And so therefore, in the  it’s very, very competitive. You know, in terms of your questions, I'm sure you can appreciate Ralph that first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR, and we feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing, and forecast the base business, you know, over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible, you know, I'm not sure that we need to trade off anything.  We're very happy with the relationships that we built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers, we've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and a, you know, alignment around value creation, where, you know, they're looking for us to save the money and create value and big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already – they're very, you know, high value compared to the rest of the industry and, you know, possible choices for patients. So, you know, good question, Ralph, certainly appreciate it, but for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now.
Steve Rusckowski: Let me just add to that. Speaking to demand,  shares that over the course of the last 10 months, we've brought up our capacity considerably, and we're going to continue to build it. And the reason for that is, we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge. And then secondly is, we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market.  And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of retesting has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we entered the second half, and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking about what they need to do to get people back into those venues.  And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life. And I know that we are still trying to figure that out. And that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future. And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So, we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into 22. Thanks, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Justin Bowers : Hey, good morning. This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. Just with respect to the guide, can you kind of frame the high-end and the low-end for us in terms of your testing assumptions, and then also the through process on the increase in serology testing through the quarter?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. Sure Justin. So, you know it's multivariable. So there's several ways you could come to the high and low-end. So, what I would say is, you know, they're all based on the three major drivers with most of it being on the base volume recovery, and the level of PCR, you know, volume to lesser extent, serology. So, you know, if we don't see a significant fall off from where we stand today, in PCR, or if it, you know, surges up again, you know, because of these variants, or some other unknown factors, certainly that would take us, you know, to the higher-end combined with, you know, if the base business also were to continue to recover and not, you know, go the opposite direction as COVID surged again.  So, there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction, that would move us to the higher-end. And then if for some reason COVID fell off markedly, even more than we're planning, and as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in the first six months, as that midpoint, and the base business did not show recovery, or even, you know, potentially take a little bit of step back for economic or other reasons.  And that would take you to the low end, but you know, I can't at this point, provide exact, you know, changes in the base and COVID, because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one, but directionally that's what, you know,  that our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, you know, a modest recovery, but not full for the first six months of the base business. And then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first six months with the second quarter being, you know, markedly lower than the first quarter.
Justin Bowers: Okay, got it. And then just to clarify the earlier comments, it sounded like the base business right now is kind of running stable month-over-month from December levels, are we interpreting that correctly? And then, just in terms of the molecular tests, reported on the website at, you know, 32.8 million is that the right number, look like kind of a huge step-up from February to January, but more importantly is that kind of where you guys are now for total molecular? And I'll hop back in queue. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Sure. Steve, do you want to take that or would you like me to.
Steve Rusckowski: Well let me – the step-up is, you know the step-up that we've seen based on the strong delivery that we had in the fourth quarter in the beginning of January. So, we are – as I said in my introductory comments, you know, we are one of the leading providers of COVID-19 testing. Second is, it does not include serology and did ask a question about serology, because we do believe there'll be an increasing role of serology throughout 2021. We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around, you know, their urgency of getting vaccinated. And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called  testing, and this will allow physicians and patients to see if in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines. And we'll be bringing that out at platforms in the next few weeks. And you know, this can help us, you know, determining the vaccine is being effective.  So, we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology, and this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology, and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post-vaccinations and broad population. So, we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in 2021 in that regard.
Shawn Bevec: And Justin, just to close out on your other question, yes, 32.8 million was the total through as of Monday, and that was up 1.8 million over the prior two weeks. So, about 130,000 a day in the prior two weeks. Operate our next question.
Operator: Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Hey, good morning. Steve, you mentioned the focus of the new administration on COVID testing, can you talk about how you think Quest role might change at all, serving the pandemic? And if we start to see greater adoption of home testing, how do you think Quest is going to be positioned for that?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, so I think, you know, the new administration is leveraging what we've done in the past as a country and as an industry, and taking it to the next level. I mean, you see the capacity that's out there around the country. Back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests. So, obviously up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there'll be a change beyond the PCR test. As I mentioned earlier, now there's going to be a greater demand, you know, for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, back to leisure activities, get back to life. And so, we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing, and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if the fact a person that wants to engage in whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. So, when we get into that world, you know we’ll obviously be providing the testing, but as I said earlier, there's a number of services, and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And, like so much in healthcare, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities, and a number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half.  I think, you know, the first quarter is outlined in our guidance  start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for, you know, better infection rates, you know, better position for populations to get back to work life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then just to follow up, I have a two-parter on unit pricing. I was curious if you could weigh in, do you have any notable commercial contract renewals in 2021? And then maybe more broadly, as you have discussions with commercial payers now, you know, do you feel like you have a little more of a, you know good footing you know in terms of negotiating price given, you know, the role the labs have served, you know, amidst the pandemic?
Steve Rusckowski: You know, let me start with where you ended, I think our relationship with health plans has never been better. As you've seen over the last number of years, we've increased our presence, we have the best access to lives now that we've had in over a decade. And so, we are in a very strong footing. And also, during the pandemic I’ll share that we were deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership, and also their employees. So, the relationship is continued to strengthen. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, and Mark said, as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition around quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price, we believe our value proposition is really second to none. And as I said, you know in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and net promoter scores, and those are quite strong. So, when you bring those facts to the table Jack, our position in terms of working out, the forward-looking relationships has, you know, provided a much stronger foundation, and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So, we're in a good position with our plans. We’re in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that. And also, I shared that we continue to make progress with our united relationship with a preferred lab network and the building relationship with Anthem were quite encouraged about as well. So, we feel good about a relationship and the progress we've made, but also the opportunities in front of us to continue to build on what we've been talking about. So, Mark anything you could like to add there?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation where, you know people holding their breath, every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I can tell you, you know, this has become largely invisible to you all, you know unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract, as opposed to having, you know different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it, because there was no price concession. And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer. And, you know, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, you know, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident, is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their prospective or current members.  So, you know, really that's what it's been about, as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. And now you've got an external benchmark, you can look to. So, we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be – it will not come with a major price concessions, you know, we're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting and with that actually comes good pricing that we feel, you know, represents the market, and then these come with upside, whereas we performed, you know, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting in the last couple years and how we would expect to contract going forward.
Jack Meehan: Nice, Thanks, everyone.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Adam Noble: Great, thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to, I guess double back to your comments around reimbursement for COVID PCR, you know wanted just to confirm that you're assuming throughout the first half, that the PHE is extended so that the Medicare rate, you know with the add-on payment remains 100? And then you talked about the, kind of the commercial reimbursement, you know, potentially declining over time, just any thoughts around kind of what the magnitude of changes on the commercial side you guys could potentially see in PCR?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, sure. I'll comment on then Steve may want to add. So yes, we would expect that as long as the, you know,  continues that this structure with the, you know, opportunity to earn $100 per test from CMS will continue now, you know, that is a very small portion of our volume. But we would expect that however, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is some risk, they could decouple it. There's no guarantee that that will continue. So, and – you know and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the , but they could also, like they did January 1 change the approach. However, you know, at this point, yes, we're assuming the highest probability is that as long as the  continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. You know, on commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so, you know, while we defend, and, you know, feel like we do a good job of explaining why our reimbursement makes sense, as we've negotiated some, you know, new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology, and we think we've done a good job, but obviously, there are other labs as well. And, you know, to the extent that other labs, you know, don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. But certainly, in our mind, you know, we would expect to continue to defend commercial contracts as well to the  seeing the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that, as long as the zero patient out of pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because, you know, to avoid having to build patience, where historically, we've shared that we get about, you know, $0.70 on the dollar, and actually get, you know 100% of that payments from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well. So that's, that's a factor I don't want people to forget about. Steve?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, just to add to the CMS new methodology for reimbursement. As you know, we are reimbursed at $100 when we report the results in two days and $75 for all other results. And to Mark's comments, we have seen a few payers to look at this model as well. But we're encouraged by the public health emergency extension through 2021. And also, just to share our timeliness of our results are quite good. We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID. Molecular tests resulted in less than two days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that, you know, the majority of our testers are resulted in two days or less. So, in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity, because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. So, I think we're progressing well. We're very good provider of the test. You know, time is one element and quality and reliability, and also the type of testing we have done, you know, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry, are really quite strong. So, if you look at the accuracy and the quality of our testing, you know, people have come to consider us the gold standard. And I think that will bode us well going forward as well.
Adam Noble: And if I could just …
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Eugene Kim your line is open, with Wolfe Research.
Eugene Kim: Good morning and thank you for all the color around guidance. Apologies if I missed this, but have you guys provided the average reimbursement levels for the PCR testing in Q4? And can you comment whether you're embedding similar levels in the first half guidance? 
Mark Guinan: Yeah. So we didn't specifically call that out, but I can tell you that it did not change much in Q4 from where it was in Q3, you know, so, you know, it was above $90. We, you know, we do have some client bill customers that are less than 100. And we don't, you know, get paid for 100% of the testing, sometimes due to missing date, and so on and so forth. We do get some denials. But you know, certainly north of 90 was AWR previously. Now, we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and reduce over time in the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance, we did make an assumption that, you know, given the new model with the $75, not just with CMS with some commercial payers, we're not going to get paid or 100% of our tests at that 100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that two-day turnaround time. So, that'll create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that, you know, there's a lot of capacity there for a very competitive environment in that client bill arena aside from the third party.
Eugene Kim: Got it, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, on the base business, can I confirm you said, you don't think you'll get back to pre-pandemic levels in first half? And is that compared to 2019 or does that include our  as well? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Yeah, that is correct. We would – I said was, you know, as we're looking at the back half, even though we're not giving guidance because there's too much uncertainty around it. We expect it to be back to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of 2021. So, in the first half, we still expect to be down versus 2019. We felt, even though the pandemic didn't start largely for our business till March, easiest compare and how to talk about it is 2019 volumes. We did have a large growth for the first two months of 2020 as we share that in our first quarter earnings call, you know, so that compounds things a little bit on a year-to-year comparison. But, yes, we're going to talk about our volume performance relative to 2019 because it's the cleanest compare for the whole year. 
Steve Rusckowski: And when we speak to that, I heard it in your question. We are looking at organic growth. And so you know, we spoke of a couple of acquisitions that we closed last year. And you know, in our organic discussions we're excluding those and any other deals we might do prospectively. So, it's organic, based business we're talking to.
Mark Guinan: And we think the best representation of utilization, so that's why we think it's important. Our organic performance versus 2019, kind of gives a sense, because of our size and reach. We think were the market overall is performing.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So, the acquisition revenue will be on top of that. We obviously announced a couple of deals and what we said is, we have a good funnel and anything we might do prospectively be on top of what we said.
Operator: Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, great. Thank you and good morning. So, just one quick one. Can you provide a little bit more color on how should we think about the margin progression throughout 2021? And particularly how much of your, with the core business still being down, how much of that is the margin headwind? Just sort of thinking about the dynamics as we go from the first half, the second half with COVID volumes testing coming down, and you've returned to price to be more normal for the core business, just wanted to go get some thoughts on the margin progression of work flow, please? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, it depends, when you when you say is it a headwind? It depends on to what you're comparing it. So, as we, you know, expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period, because we are in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost, you know, operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recoveries, and not get out in front of ourselves, you know, we're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with, you know, volumes that are down single digits at this point.  So, our cost structure on the basis business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small, you know, pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that, you know, growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. Now, on the other side, as we talked about, you know, expect erosion in our COVID volumes, you know that, you know, greater headwinds, and how those two pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, you know,  specifically. But, you know, I would at this point expect that the COVID reduction, more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we as we move forward.  And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test. And we shared that we expected some, you know, pressure on that as we go, you know, from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially, and then likely, even more so in the back half of the year. So, without getting into specifics, those are kind of things you should, you know, specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about, as you think about where margins are going to go through the first half and into the second half of 2021.
Derik de Bruin: Thank you.
Operator: Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on your comment around the acquisition opportunities. Steve, you know, one of the things that was anticipated that with PAMA there'd be a lot of pressure and you'd see more acquisition opportunities with PAMA now being pushed out, does that change anything? Number one. And number two, when we think about reimbursement, as we've been talking about, for molecular tests, etcetera. I would think a lot of these labs have done well during this period of time, does that change what their expectations are at all around what their business is worth as we think about acquisition opportunities?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So, thanks Lisa for the question. So, the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals. And, you know, you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did and that's going to help us and we continue to see a nice funnel for 2021 as well. And as you all know, hospital volumes up and down through 2020. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is, a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes, you know, acquiring their outreach business and includes professional app service agreements, like we just announced in the fourth quarter. Now that relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I can tell you, it took a long time to get there. And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the healthcare market this year help bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. The second is on other commercial laboratories. Yes, you're right. Number of commercial laboratories have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with, you know, all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back, and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry, with consolidation, with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that, you know, there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. So, yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change, you know, as we get throughout 2021, we believe the realities of what the new world will be with, you know, tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and strong balance sheet, we’re in a very nice position to continue to do that. And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there.  People have added new systems, and, you know, potentially, does this present a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID, like ? You know, we are watching it, you know, obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID. And we help them with some of the other work, but for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by the way, good example,  that's a long stretch. I mean, there's a lot to – lot more to getting a client to flip over than the lab capacity, you have to have a Salesforce,  logistic capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in a contract with the health plans. So, we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little, you know, little cautious in, in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And then we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well. Thank you.
Mark Guinan : So, if I could add Steve, just a couple things. Lisa, around your question, around our pipeline, at any given point in time, you know, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing, I can tell you that, you know, none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now are getting, you know expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble. So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, you know, hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing. But you know, the people we're talking to right now recognize that that’s short-term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion.  And then the, you know, while PAMA gets a pause this year, you know, there’s still, you know, some risk. But more importantly, as you know, we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to, you know, put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, you know, re-contracting, that work that's outside, you know, the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatient, at independent laboratory rate.  So it's not – this pressure is not just coming from Washington, it's coming from the commercial payers as well. And from quite frankly, patients who, you know don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. So, there's a number of things that are getting the C suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about. Do they really want to be in this business? And will this be a good time to monetize? And so therefore, I really don't see the pipeline of interest having been impacted over the last 12 months negatively.
Operator: Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning. As I think about the various components of your response to COVID-19, and you're role in testing, two things that stick out as step changes from a pre-COVID  capacity, and then consumer engagement. I think the number of patients using QuestDirect has doubled in the last 15 months. So, just curious, what can you do and as we move to sort of a post-COVID world to leverage that increased consumer facing presents consumer engagement, as well as the added capacity that it sounds like you're still bringing on?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Thanks for the question. And we're very bullish on our consumer strategy. As you all know, we have five strategies for growth, one of which is the consumer strategy and our direct-to-consumer business that we've built over the last several years has done quite well and we do believe that the pandemic has now been an accelerator for that. We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said, in my introductory comments, interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront the strong role of testing and overall health care. And questioning has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built. And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe, you know, there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged, that will engage differently with healthcare delivery systems, and how they engage with the physician.  With telehealth, we have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. But at the same time, a lot of patients as well, and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as  so much else in their lives.  And so we're very well-positioned with reputation with capabilities. And so, we are investing in that in a significant way more so than we would have, if we did not have the pandemic. And so, we think about, you know, the growth drivers going forward, and we'll talk about this some more in our Investor Day. We're very bullish about the opportunity we have in front of us around our QuestDirect, but also the consumer opportunity in general.
Operator: Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. Just one quick one on the deal side. Possible you could frame for us the Hackensack opportunity, the contribution to growth in 2021, and the first half guide? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. So, we, you know, we don't typically announce the revenue impact of deals like this, and again, I want to remind you, this is organic. So, this is not something we bought. We worked with Hackensack and demonstrate to them that we can perform the same work they do in their lab at a better cost better value. And you know, for a system that size, you know, they're significant lab spend. So this is – is going to be quite impactful and beneficial to them, and we see that as a, you know, opportunity, obviously to also get other clients, who will get their attention to see Hackensack, you know, thinks that this will work well, you know, in addition to some of the other hospital systems that we've learned over the last couple of years. So, we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be, you know, material to our growth. And we talked a couple years ago at our Investor Day and we’ll likely give an update on this. We thought we could get more than 100 basis points, and you know, somewhere between 100 basis points to 200 basis points of growth every year from our PLS business and certainly this one is a large contributor to that, and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that. So, you know, very large deal, but you know, we are not going to, we haven't had a historical precedent of pulling out the exact revenue, but it will be noticeable, and material as we go into 2021 and beyond.
Operator: Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty around second half in the trajectory of the combat for more normalized utilization level, but if we step away from the timing and just think about the margin trajectory, how should we think about core margin trajectory from where they were, let's say in the fourth quarter, to where they can expand to as utilization comes back to a more normalized level? So again, the question is more about the margin trajectory, as it relates to utilization, not about the timing. And then my second question is more about, sort of a market demand. So, how do you think about changes in physician behavior patterns? And you know, we're seeing telehealth becoming more integrated into the workflow. So, do you think that there's going to be any impact on longer term lab testing demand curve because of that, I don’t know if the experiences early in the year could shed some light on that?
Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Mark, you want to take the first part. I’ll take the second.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, obviously, the, you know, size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. So, as we, you know, progress. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where, you know, COVID testing is still around for, you know, for a while. As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly, by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin.  So, where will our base business be? Once we get back to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be, you know, slightly higher margin than it was pre-pandemic. Because as you look at, you know, our invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets of the pay for is that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, you know, given the pause on PAMA this year, and given, you know, the fact that we've done really well and other price concessions, despite, you know, significant increases in our  that was warranted during the pandemic, you know, as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well threw it, and obviously driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, you know, that level of business should be more profitable. And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first two months of 2020, and our ability to leverage that growth, you know, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business, but of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins, you know, fall down. So, you know, longer-term, the good news is, you know, we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion pre-pandemic, and we will, you know, we'll get back there. But for a while, it'll be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable, you know, over the next, certainly 18 months or so.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. And the question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully, because we do believe going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. You know, as we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems. And, you know, that will be consistent going forward. But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth and we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers, and that was before the pandemic.  And those telehealth providers are not going to work with  of laboratories who will work with a few. And they will have a real type for lab network as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options. So, we feel good about that. Second, as you see more consolidation going on in physicians and we see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, , acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices, or customers. You think about debt consolidation, and think about their role, not thinking about where they add value bringing all those physicians together. We believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator, like , to provide lab services more broadly, and in really reduce the variation they have with other physicians. And just one last point to show that, you know, this world is moving towards tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, United Healthcare actually announced the removal of lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. And so, it's just another example of a major health plan tightening up their network. So, we think the physician side will change and there'll be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe is a good trend and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market.
Operator: Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Erin.
Erin Wright: Thanks. Thanks so much for sneaking me in. Just a follow up on that competitive landscape and consolidation. So it sounds like you don't expect there to be any sort of meaningful impact on your opportunity around consolidation just even given the dramatically expanded install bases, PCR instruments across the U.S. over the past year. I mean, I would assume that customers do want to monetize those investments to some extent, I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe COVID testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean, it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint. And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to COVID testing? It will obviously diminish with the vaccine rollout, but could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the flu testing exposure you do have? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski : Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure, the pandemics put on any of them. And we're encouraged by, you know, the level of discussions we had, and, you know, the deals we've closed as an example that this is happening. So, we think that's good. On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that, you know, some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity, it's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. But as you know, the dust settles and testing volumes go down, you know, the reality of what we talked about in  doesn't change.  And we think there will be many of those that would be looking at their options. And we do believe that COVID testing will continue into 2022. We believe that this, you know will be a virus that we'll have to manage. So, it will be more flu like, and something that will, you know, will be behind us and beyond 2021. And, you know, it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be. But you should not think that this is going to be the testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year. But we do believe there will be with us in 2022, as well.  And as far as the flu, you know, we talked about prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel that when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu, and also COVID. And so, we have seen, you know that be accepted, but as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So, that has changed somewhat. Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the PAMA point of the question?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, I don't have anything to add. Shawn.
Operator: Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess just one quick question. Mark, as I think about your capital deployment, obviously, you're generating a lot of cash. And it sounds like the hospital acquisition opportunities are the pipeline's there, but maybe a little slow in coming through. So, how should we be thinking about your willingness to buy back more aggressively in the front end? You know, and how should we be thinking about, just other capital deployment opportunities, whether it's internal, on the CapEx side for growth? 
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, we are investing quite a bit internally. You know, as you may have seen or you will see our, you know, capital spend for 2020. You know, we ended up 418 million, which was above the initial range. A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally, because we think that's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that, obviously, is related to our invigorate program. You know, we are moving all of our new  test to a single platform, we continue to move forward on that, and then a big piece of the 2020. And the first half of 2021 was related to Quest and our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final set out in equipment to put in a narrow drive some of the spending in the first half. So, we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital. And we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to 200 million in the first half, which is you know, about 50% of what we spent in 2020 as we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on Clifton and then also the normal priorities on which we spend. On share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is, you know, we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployment. We will have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021, Q1, you know, behind us to see how that performance continues, and what our expectations, you know, for Q2 look like at that point, because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us you know, better line of sight and expectations. But, you know, by announced by, you know us seeking and getting approval and announcing a billion dollar increase in our authorization, certainly you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said, specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically. And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give the majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders to our dividend. And our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the 250, you know, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, you know, we're behind that 50%. So, we have some catch-up to do. 
Steve Rusckowski: Let me just add to that performance we had in 2020 and the performance that we're indicating, with our guidance in 2021, is affording us an opportunity to invest in our growth strategies. And that includes what we've talked about on this call. Working on the relationships with health plans are gaining traction was presenting our lab strategy view to health systems, hospital health systems, what we're doing around advanced diagnostics, and then finally, what was asked about earlier around the consumer opportunity in front of us. So, implied in the guidance is an increase in investment for those growth drivers to accelerate growth of our base business within 2021, but as we enter 2022 as well. So if there are no further questions. I like to thank everyone for again joining us on this call. We appreciate your continued support and interest and you have a great day. Take care.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call. A transcript of prepared remarks on this call will be posted later today on Quest Diagnostics website at www.questdiagnostics.com.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2020 conference call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question and answer session that will follow, are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President, Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic’s severity and duration, the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic which are drivers beyond the company’s knowledge and control.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes.  Finally, growth rate associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a very strong third quarter, benefiting from continued demand from COVID-19 testing as well as the rapid recovery from healthcare utilization. We have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date, more than any other provider. We’ve also developed and introduced several new innovations that are contributing to enabling the country’s ability to return to work, the classroom, and on the athletic field.  I’m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished through the COVID-19 pandemic and I want to thank our 47,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.  This morning I’ll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on the third quarter results and our updated financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Our financial performance in the third quarter was very strong. For the quarter, total revenue grew by more than 42% to $2.79 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 164% on a reported basis to $4.14 and nearly 145% on an adjusted basis to $4.31. These results reflect continued demand for COVID-19 testing and continued recovery of our base testing volumes as healthcare systems resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries. Organic base testing volumes orders declined high single digits in July and improved in the quarter to mid to high single digit declines in September versus the prior year. Demand for COVID-19 testing came from several areas: clinical testing ordered by healthcare providers as the virus spread throughout much of the country, especially for non COVID-19 pre-surgical patients and people in high risk populations like nursing homes and prisons; in retail testing in our standard network access points, such as our drive-through sites offered across the country by CVS and Wal-Mart; workplace testing as employers sought to return employees to the job and their offices; university testing to facilitate the return of students to campus life, including sports; and our consumer testing direct testing offered by Quest Direct. We’ve also demonstrated innovation and agility in bringing COVID-19 testing to our nation. In the quarter, we were granted an emergency use authorization, or EUA to offer unobserved self-collection. We were the first provider to receive an EUA due to the pandemic or [indiscernible]. Finally, we teamed up with Wal-Mart and DroneUp to pilot a program for contactless delivery of specialty kits using drones.  Also in the quarter, we announced an initiative along with our Quest Diagnostics Foundation to address and reduce healthcare disparities in underserved communities, including those impacted by COVID-19. This value-based commitment builds on our existing work with [indiscernible] health centers and will focus on serving people of color, elderly and underserved populations in locations throughout the United States. Quest plans to donate testing services and fund a range of initiatives estimated to total more than $100 million. Our goal is to improve access to testing and drive awareness of value of diagnostic innovations and managing health. Before updating you on our base business, what I’d like to do is comment on our recent CMS change to Medicare payment for COVID-19 testing and our decision to return the CARES Act funding to the government. In conjunction with our trade association, we’ve been currently reviewing the new reimbursement policy for high throughput COVID-19 molecular testing from CMS will impact laboratory and patients we serve. Last week’s announcement removes uncertainty that was an overhang on COVID-19 testing reimbursement.  Finally, we’re grateful for the CARES Act funding from last spring which provided us at an important time of great uncertainty for our country. Now several months into the pandemic, we no longer require this funding and as a result, we will be returning these funds to the government. That was the right thing to do. We’re making progress on our strategy to accelerate growth in the base business, so as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate are to grow more than 2% per year through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions; expand relationships with health plan and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.  Now I’ll share a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Since the second quarter, we close our acquisition of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, referred to as MACL, which is Indiana, and we did a couple two small tuck-in acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions have been performing well during the pandemic; for example, our Memorial Hermann outreach acquisition announced earlier this year, as well as this recent MACL acquisition have driven growth in both COVID-19 testing and our base business. We’ve also seen growth in advanced diagnostics from our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics.  The second growth driver, expanding relationships with health plan and hospital health systems is also delivering. Our hospital reference testing volumes excluding COVID-19 have returned to growth year over year. Given the challenges that hospitals are facing, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategy, so in professional lab services this year we have logged a record amount of bookings, represent larger and longer term agreements than in the past.  We also continue to make progress on our health plan strategy. Within the UnitedHealthcare preferred laboratory network, we’re helping United reduce out-of-PLN lab spending through the previously announced zero out-of-pocket benefit. In addition, United has added enhancements that reduce the administrative burden for physicians and patients related to those tests requiring preauthorization. Then in August, we entered into a new strategic relationship with Anthem in 12 states. We’re working with Anthem to improve quality and efficiency in delivery of laboratory services. Then finally, additionally we’re working with major national payors to enable their members to access COVID-19 testing through Quest’s relationships with major retailers.  We made progress on our third element of our strategy to accelerate growth by offering the broadest access to innovation. In the quarter, we launched three new combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, reducing time for physician to diagnose and treat patients by identifying nearly 20 viral and bacterial infections from a single swab. We also launched our automated next generation sequencing solution that enables individuals to access genetic testing insights about hereditary diseases at consumer price points through Ancestry Health.  Finally, we grew our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. Quest Direct test offerings continue to resonate with consumers. In the quarter, we launched our COVID-19 active infection test, offering consumers a choice of using an at-home kit or getting the specimen collection done at a drive-through location. Also, we made remarkable progress in the surge of sign-ups to our My Quest patient portal. Today, roughly 13 million patients have a My Quest account to make appointments or receive their results through their smartphone or their computer. In the third quarter, on average more than 100,000 patients per week signed up for this service. This is more than double the rate we experienced before the pandemic. Now, the second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence by continuing to pursue our goals to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains while at the same time enhancing our customer experience and overall service levels.  Here’s a couple of examples. We have standardized on the Siemens immunoassay platform in 14 of our 18 regional laboratories. The solution drives workflow efficiencies and has enabled more than a 50% reduction in our equipment footprint. We are still in the early stages of these realized savings but so far, we’re pleased with this progress. Then also, our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is being prepared to go live in early 2021. When complete, this state of the art facility will be the most highly automated in our laboratory network and will represent the final regional lab to be converted to our standard operational system, which we call [indiscernible]. This will mark the culmination of a multi-year initiative to simplify, streamline and standardize our regional laboratory operations.  Now I’d like to turn it over to Mark to take you through the results and update you on our outlook. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.79 billion, up roughly 43% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 44% compared to the prior year, which reflected significant demand for COVID-19 testing services offset by a modest decline in base testing volumes. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 19.7% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 3%.  We continued to experience improving performance in our base business in the third quarter. Orders for organic base testing compared to our pre-pandemic business declined high single digits in July and improved to a mid to high single digit decline in September versus the prior year. For the entire third quarter, base testing volumes declined roughly 5% versus the prior year and benefited from recent M&A and the new PLS [indiscernible] that Steve highlighted earlier.  We also experienced a significant contribution from COVID-19 testing during the third quarter, performing approximately 9.9 million molecular tests and 1.5 million serology tests. We exited the third quarter averaging approximately 93,000 COVID-19 molecular and 11,000 serology tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 20.9% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by unit price headwinds of approximately 1.7% in the third quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This included the ongoing impact of PAMA.  Reported operating income was $718 million or 25.8% of revenues compared to $313 million or 16% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $831 million or 29.8% of revenues compared to $349 million or 17.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by strong revenue growth in the third quarter, reflecting the relatively high drop-through on incremental volume in our business.  Reported EPS was $4.14 in the quarter compared to $1.56 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared to $1.76 last year.  Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.46 billion year to date through September 30 versus $895 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the third quarter includes approximately $138 million of provider relief under the CARES Act. As a result of our strong financial position, we are planning to return the entire CARES Act funding we received, which Steve noted earlier.  Additionally, we are accelerating the redemption of our senior notes maturing in April of 2021. We will use the proceeds of the bond offering that we completed in May 2020 to repay these notes. We expect to complete the early debt redemption in November. Turning to guidance, we raised our full year 2020 outlook as follows: revenues now expected to be between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion, an increase of approximately 13.9% to 17.8% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.22 to $9.22 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 to $10; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.75 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. We continue to operate under the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued recovery in the base business as well as demand for and duration of COVID-19 molecular testing are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast. With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following: the midpoint of our full year outlook generally assumes base testing volumes to remain modestly below last prior year levels as we exit 2020; COVID-19 testing volumes averaging nearly 90,000 tests per day for the molecular test and 10,000 tests per day for the serology test in Q4; COVID-19 molecular reimbursement generally stable with recent trends. Our performance through mid October is slightly above these assumptions, but again our guidance reflects the uncertainty of the current environment. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we are currently in the early stages of launching our recently announced initiatives with the Quest Foundation to reduce heath disparities in underserved communities. As we move forward, we expect to exclude the costs associated with this multi-year initiative in determining our adjusted results.  While we aren’t prepared to share a detailed outlook for 2021 today, I’d like to offer some considerations for next year. First, we are likely to have an easy compare in our base business for much of the year, especially in Q2. Second, demand for COVID-19 testing is likely to persist well into 2021. We believe that molecular PCR testing will continue to play a very important role in diagnosing, tracking and tracing active COVID-19 infections and that there will eventually be a growing need for serology testing as vaccines and additional therapies come to the market. Third, we are working to understand the details of the recent CMS announcement regarding COVID-19 molecular reimbursement for 2021, and finally as a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement costs under PAMA in 2021 given the one-year delay included in the CARES Act. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. To summarize, we had a very strong third quarter and have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date. We’ve also developed and introduced a number of new innovations allowing the country to get back to work, into the classroom, and onto the athletic fields. We’ve seen further signs of recovery in healthcare utilization as our base testing volume continued to recover rapidly throughout the third quarter. Finally, again I’m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished throughout this very difficult time, and I thank all the 42,000 people at Quest Diagnostics for all their hard work and dedication. Now we’d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator instructions] The first question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. How’s everything? I just wanted to touch back on your comments, Mark, about the reimbursement for next year. I know that a lot still is unknown, but just for modeling purposes, maybe can you talk about your current turnaround time, what you expect your molecular capacity to be by that time in January, and should we assume would you need to make any more further investments to be able to get that $100 reimbursement for molecular test?  My second question is just about cash flow - obviously it’s very elevated because of all the testing. What do you expect--how do expect to deploy that once you’re able to, and maybe about timing the cash deployment since it’s very elevated? Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski: Let me start with the operational piece of that, Ann. First of all, we’re running about a capacity of 200,000 tests per day, even though what you heard from our guidance is less than that in terms of actual results. We’ve done that for two reasons. One is to be prepared for the fall where we’re anticipating further demand for COVID-19 testing, and then secondly is when we have more capacity and we result less, it helps us with turnaround time, so I’m happy to share that right now we’re averaging less than two days for testing for COVID-19. What I’ll also say, as I said in my early introductory remarks, we’re trying to understand the exact guidelines, and I’m sure there will be more detail from CMS In terms of recovery--excuse me, reimbursement changes. When we’re looking at turnaround times, we’re looking at it today from specimen collection to results, and that’s also by calendar day, and there will be more specificity on this from CMS but--you know, there will be more clarity around that.  So we’re performing well with, I think, capacity versus our demand, and we’re not stopping there. We’re actually increasing our capacity as we speak. We’re working out some of the last capacity we can get out of some of the new systems we put in place, and secondly we’re looking at applying pooling to some of our IBB platforms, so that should get us to eventually coming out of this year at 250,000 per day versus the 200,000 today, so we should be able to meet the demand and keep our turnaround times at the level I’ve already indicated. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so just to add to that, Ann, the devil’s in the details. We need to understand exactly when the clock starts on turnaround time. Based on where we think it should end up, we expect to be in very good shape around meeting the criteria. At this point, assume we have to get more than half of those tests turned around in two days or less, and obviously we need clarification and certainty around that, and that’s for obviously Medicare, and we still also need to work through some of the issues with the commercial payors as well to understand how it’s going to work with them. That’s why we’re cautious in terms of committing too much to what this pronouncement by CMS means. We have a lot of work to do, but certainly we’re optimistic as we look at it that we should be able to meet that requirement. On cash flow, as you see, we’re obviously feeling much better about our cash flow at this point. The fact that we’re repaying the debt early from April that we issued as a pre-issuance in May shows our confidence, returning $138 million which of course is deducted from our projection when I said at least $4.75 billion, so we’re expecting a very strong cash year. You know, Steve mentioned we have a very strong M&A pipeline, and I’ve said many time to investors I would prefer to do M&A because when we do it, we’re highly confident that that’s a better return for our shareholders, but we do have very strict criteria. We have to find deals that meet those criteria, so I’m optimistic that we will deploy a chunk of that for M&A and then at some point you can expect us to return to our normal capital strategy as we move forward throughout the calendar year, or early next year.
Ann Hynes: Great, thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you about the progression of core volumes for the quarter. I believe you said August core volumes were down mid to high single digits, and then in today’s release I think it also has the September exit rate at about the same level, down mid singles to high singles. This would seem to suggest that the baseline volume return to normal has slowed a little bit. Is that consistent with what you guys have actually experienced, and if so, what do you think needs to happen to see it improve further? If it’s not, what’s the nuance that I’m missing? Then just to put a final point on it, does guidance assume you see a continuing improvement from the September exit rate or basically a continuation at that level? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Thanks for the question, Stephen. As we mentioned, volume improved from July, so really September versus August is fairly flat, so yes, there was a little stagnation in improvement in the baseline, not completely surprising given the recent uptick in COVID again. So it hasn’t gotten worse for us, but it did not continue its improvement, and that’s why when I talked about what we expect in Q4, we don’t expect a full recovery any time this calendar year. Obviously we have a very broad range - $300 million, so within that range there’s multi variables, but in terms of the base business, we’re not counting on in the middle of that a complete recovery. We’re not expecting it to move materially away from where it’s been the last couple months, but that would kind of get you to that lower end and upper end of the range, depending on that along, of course, with COVID testing as well, where they go from that midpoint. So not counting on anything, but certainly improvement could lead us toward that upper end, and if it eroded a little bit, it could lead us towards the lower end of our guidance.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, and we’re watching that carefully. If you go back and hear what I said, we started off July at high single digits, and then also as I indicated in September, it was mid to high, so slight improvement there but we’re watching it as we enter the fourth quarter and as we sit here in the fourth quarter in October.
Operator: The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. I have a question on the gross margins. You came in meaningfully higher than us - clearly we’re seeing the benefits of the return of core volumes. But can you maybe help us quantify, off the gross margin that we saw in the quarter, what is coming from the return of core versus realized price for COVID testing? We understand the reimbursement, but also we’re hearing you talk a lot more about direct-to-consumer testing, which I’m assuming comes with a higher price point, so if we can just get a little bit more clarity on that.
Mark Guinan: Sure, so Ricky, first I’ll confirm that direct-to-consumer does come with a higher price point. Certainly there are other expenses that go with direct-to-consumer. We’ve actually invested incrementally in some marketing to drive awareness and so on, but from a gross margin perspective, the consumer testing is higher than our core business. Recall even though we feel good about that business, it’s still a very small part of our overall enterprise. Then between COVID and base, obviously we don’t get into gross margin on specific test offerings, but the one benefit I will point out on COVID is that there’s no patient responsibility, so when you think about it - and I don’t have the precise numbers, but just let’s say because our overall enterprise, about 20% of our revenues come from patients, if we collect, as we’ve shared, $0.70 on the dollar, you can imagine that there is about a 6% higher margin on that particular business because it’s 100 reimbursed by payors instead of having any patient responsibility, so there is some benefit to the gross margin. But in COVID, it really is unrelated to price and really has everything to do with the coverage policies and not having that inability to collect all the money that we’re due.
Ricky Goldwasser: Great, and just one follow-up, if I may. You gave us some early puts and takes for 2021. We’re starting to hear some companies that are accelerating hiring in preparation for next year. When you think about increasing first serology associated with COVID vaccines, etc., should we assume a step-up in costs related to increased hiring in preparation for that?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, so Ricky we managed our workforce carefully over the last six to nine months. As you’ll recall, the second quarter we had to trim down our workforce, so we furloughed over 6,000 people, we reduced work schedules, we cut salaries including myself and Mark and our board, and then we saw the steady recovery in our base business coupled with the COVID testing that we’ve done.  So we’ve reinstated salaries, we have brought back full work weeks and we’ve brought back the vast majority of the furloughed employees, and actually we’ve hired people, so we’ve hired people where we need to hire people, particularly in areas like specimen processing. You can see with the volumes we’re seeing, you have to have a lot of people to receive all these specimens to sort it out before they go into the lab. But I’ll tell you, we’re still being very, very careful before we add another person. We’re being very careful in overhead, and Mark can go through exactly what’s in our expenses, but we’ve been very limited in hiring in our expense categories and will continue to be very [indiscernible] with our hiring for our overhead with our laboratory operations and our operations in general. The reason for that is we want to make sure we don’t’ get ahead of ourselves. We feel we got good leverage in the third quarter, as you see, and we believe we have a workforce in place to manage the demand we’re getting right now. We’re constantly looking at what we think the future demand will be, but we want to make sure we don’t get ahead of ourselves. We indicated what we think the fourth quarter’s going to be. We are building capacity to get more COVID-19 testing done. We have plenty of capacity available for serology without adding a lot of staff, with the exception of some of the volume based jobs as I mentioned, and so as we get deeper into the fourth quarter and we get into the beginning of next year, we’ll then assess if we need to add some people. But so far, we’ve done some modest hiring, we’re back to full workforce, and we’re watching it, frankly, daily and we want to make sure we don’t add people before we need them.
Mark Guinan: Yes, so we don’t have any proactive plans to add resources, Ricky. We’re going to continue to monitor demand in our business, and we have the flexibility generally to ramp in a fairly short window as volumes move in one direction or the other. I can confirm no plan to add to the expense base in Q4 in anticipation of anything next year at this point.
Stephen Rusckowski: And interestingly enough, this is a last point because we do have this natural hedge on this, is despite where we are with the economy, we still have attrition in some of our draws, so we’re in some places still trying to keep up. There are other options for people particularly with some of our non-exempt employment jobs, and therefore if things turn down, we could carefully turn off our spigot as well.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: Next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to the reimbursement comments, and specifically in your prepared remarks on the CMS reimbursement tweak and it removing an overhang. I guess I just want to be clear on what the expectation is now, sort of post the PHE period, assuming you meet those turnaround times. Does it sustain the $100 level, am I interpreting that right or not?  And then second piece is related just post that PHE period, my understanding is the commercial rate for COVID will be the default to your contracted rate, or there’s a rate negotiation that takes place. Is that correct, and then how should we think of that commercial rate off the $100 baseline? Thanks. 
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start with where we saw some uncertainty and therefore the word we used, overhang. First of all, for this year we had some uncertainty, as you know, in the third quarter about the emergency order that’s in place, and that was extended to October. We are hopeful that the rate would continue at $100, and it’s our expectation given that the new rate changes with the incentive that we outlined [indiscernible] on January, so therefore we’re assuming the $100 for reimbursement for the remainder of this year. But up until we heard this, there was some uncertainty about 2020. Then secondly, in 2021 remember the original rate was at $51 and it went up to $100, and so therefore the new reimbursement that’s being spoken of, again if you get the turnaround time of two days, you’re at $100, if you don’t, it’s $75, so that removes some of that uncertainty of it reverting back to where it was before we got the bump from $51 to $100.  Mark, do you want to take it on the commercial side?
Mark Guinan: Yes, generally it’s a renegotiation, Ralph. We had provisions in our contracts for new tests, and certainly the high throughput COVID-19 molecular test is one of those, so there is no provision for it to default automatically to any sort of relationship to CMS or what have you. We had to negotiate that, and I was successful in getting it to match CMS’ rate, and certainly as we go forward we’re going to have to continue to talk to our commercial payors and negotiate. There’s no set answer at this point to where commercial reimbursement might go.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.
Jack Meehan: Hey, good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the commentary around core volumes. Just a clarification first - I think you said the core was down mid single digits. Does that include M&A, just to bridge versus the monthly commentary? Then as you look out to 2021, do you think routine demand can return to the pre-COVID baseline or is there some reason why you think it might struggle to get back to 100%?
Mark Guinan: The core volumes, I want to be clear, for the quarter were mid to high single digits with an improvement from July into August, and then fairly flat in September, and that was an apples to apples comparison, so M&A puts those core volumes in a better place and then also some of the new POS deals. But we didn’t want to confound utilization by just reporting the base business. We wanted you to understand the apples to apples, almost same store analysis, and that’s the one where we’re down mid to slightly higher single digits for the full quarter. In terms of next year, like everybody else, we’re trying to figure out how quickly things might recover and to what extent. We’re looking at all the same reports you are. Given the continued [indiscernible] utilization given the potential for the economy to have impact on utilization and other uncertainties, at this point we’re not expecting any time soon to get the base volume back to the pre-pandemic levels, but with that said, it doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen. We’re just not at this point assuming it, and while we haven’t given guidance for 2021, we wanted to just give some of our initial thinking. But obviously when we come out with guidance, we’re going to give you specifics around what those assumptions are, and at that point we’ll have a lot more information.
Stephen Rusckowski: Some color around--you know, we’ve got variation around geography and around clinical franchises, so by way of example, New York City has still not recovered and we have a fair business in New York, so if you look at the percentage overall that’s affected by New York not recovering. There’s other parts of the country that are fully recovered, so we’re watching that carefully and we’re watching it by city. If things change by city or state, we can understand the consequence of that.  Then secondly, we’ve got some clinical franchises that are back to pre-pandemic levels but we still have the laggers. We have our prescription drug monitoring business which is still below pre-pandemic levels, so if you look at it from a couple different dimensions, you can understand why we’re below pre-pandemic, and then what it takes to get back to where we were going into 2020 and potentially get above it, it will require some of these areas to get back to normal levels that we saw in the winter months, before we hit the pandemic in March. 
Mark Guinan: To Steve’s point, there is a lot of complexity. We actually do have some geographies that are growing year over year, and then we have some like--and it’s really [indiscernible]. If you look at Long Island, you look at Westchester County, you look at New Jersey right outside of Manhattan, they’re in much better shape than Manhattan is, and we aren’t sure whether that has anything to do with physician office and so on. We think it might be fewer commuters going into the city, they’re getting their work done elsewhere instead of while they’re at work during the day. But certainly we don’t have any specific information on that at this point.
Operator: The next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks for the question. Overall, how are you thinking about the competitive dynamics between the point-of-care rapid testing capabilities in your COVID offerings, or should we be thinking about it as testing to get testing in this sort of environment? Then I guess a broader question here too, how are you thinking about consumer behavior when it comes to diagnostic testing in a post-COVID world? Will this inherently expedite some of your direct-to-consumer initiatives here, or does it change or affect any of those efforts, such as Quest Direct and other consumer initiatives, and will this be dramatically more meaningful from a financial perspective for you in the coming years? Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, thanks. I’ll take the first part around point-of-care solutions. As you know, there’s two point-of-care solutions. One of the point-of-care diagnostic solutions that were out there for some time provided by IBD manufacturers, and for all intents and purposes they were there for a number of months and they provided a role. Then most recently, I believe you are referring to what’s happening with the antigen testing. We do believe there will be a role for antigen testing, particularly for monitoring and surveillance of a population. But we do understand for a lot of reasons why PCR and the return to the lab model is going to continue to be the gold standard. One of the reasons for that, depending upon the quality of the antigen testing that might be applied, there are requirements around reflex testing to PCR for both positives and negatives, and also we believe that physicians do prefer PCR testing, and when we’re offered, it means flu respiratory panel and COVID tests that will be a PCR, and we think with the flu season coming out that we are going to get some demand for it as well. So we believe that antigen testing will be a necessary part of our portfolio and we do expect to be bringing out a solution for antigen testing as part of our services we offer, but it will be complementary to the PCR testing that we’re currently doing. Hopefully that provides some clarity of what we think the role will be. Then finally on the consumer piece, we do believe that there is increased interest in our direct-to-consumer offerings for the basic testing. As you all know, a number of patients have not gone to their doctors as they should. We do believe there is an opportunity for them to have their lipid panel checked for their cholesterol, make sure the statins are working properly - you know, [indiscernible] glucose A1c, sexually transmitted diseases. As we’ve mentioned, we’ve brought up serology testing direct to consumer and most recently COVID-19 testing. We believe there is interest in a very convenient approach to getting testing, and we couple this with a telehealth physician consult as part of our service and we do believe going forward, there is going to be increased demand for both telehealth in terms of its role in our business overall, and then secondly is testing and getting that either indirectly through Quest Direct or getting that through a telehealth provider as well. We’re very well positioned in that regard with our relationships with telehealth companies but also with Quest Direct. Before the pandemic, we kicked this program off, and so we have a nice platform that’s been building up volume and we feel that there’s going to be more opportunities in front of us as the demand, given the circumstances, continues to have a lot of interest from consumers. 
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: The next question is from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open.
Donald Hooker: Great, good morning. There’s a lot being talked about here, a lot of topics, but one thing that jumped out for me in your prepared remarks was the record bookings in POS. I was wondering if it’s possible to maybe size or scope that. I suspect I know why that might be the case, but I’d also love to hear your perspective on what you think is going on there, if it speaks to maybe the health of the hospital environment as well. 
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, well we’re encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the hospital business is actually growing again versus last year, and that’s encouraging, and that’s without COVID-19, so that’s an encouraging trend. We see hospitals back in business and we’re seeing the testing that you would expect from those hospitals, and we’re doing well in that marketplace. This is where what we traditionally called our reference testing business. Then in addition to this, over the years we have built up a professional lab services business. This isn’t just a new program - we’ve been working on this for over five or six years, and we’ve built up a nice portfolio of referenceable accounts and that’s serving us well. We are penning a number of long term, multi-year contracts this year that will provide growth for us in ’21 for certain, and we see continued growing interest from integrated delivery systems on how we can help them with their lab strategy. As you know, many of these hospital systems are having a difficult time through the pandemic, and now speaking with many of the CEOs, and I actually had a conversation Tuesday with one, they’re looking at a variety of options to get more efficient, get more effective. One of the areas that we’ve talked about for years, and I think it’s going to keep building momentum, is walking in and having a conversation around their lab strategy, which includes the reference testing, the sophisticate testing they send out, how it can help save their money through the acute care laboratory. Then it does beg the question of what they do with their outreach business, and in some cases they sell that to us, and that’s what we did with Memorial Hermann this year, with MACL, and we’re seeing more and more prospects.  So it continues to receive strong interest, and this year was really a banner year for bookings, and we’ll see that in the growth in ’21. Mark, anything you’d like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes Don, as you know, we don’t generally prospectively announce the size of a contract, but what we will see as we report our quarterly results and we talk about our growth and where it’s coming from, the POS contribution, so certainly moving forward you’re going to see the evidence of what Steve just talked about in some of these very large bookings and deals that we’re just starting to implement and that will accelerate our growth into 2021.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hey guys. I have a two-part question here. I guess I don’t understand why you expect COVID volumes to be down from your current levels given COVID is likely to increase - we’re already seeing the outbreaks for the 4Q. But even if they are, like just say it’s 90 versus the 100 pace that we’re at now, the margin assumption for 4Q is still meaningfully lower. Maybe Ricky was asking about this earlier, but is there any additional costs - bonuses or anything that maybe you’re going to do in the fourth quarter that you didn’t do a year ago, that would suggest the margin sequentially falling, given your guidance?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so I did not intend to imply that PCR volumes will be reduced in Q4. Actually the midpoint of the guidance assumes it stays where it is, where we are right now, and as I shared, through the first couple of weeks of October we’re actually slightly ahead of the midpoint of guidance. I wanted to clarify that. In terms of margin, really nothing of significance. We did have in Q3 a significant catch-up expense on our bonus. As I’m sure you could imagine, early in the year we were projecting to significantly miss our targets, and then Q3 really reversed that and got us to a point where we’re expected to exceed our targets, so in Q4 we would just have, assuming we deliver, the Q4 proportion of that.  So actually, there was in Q3 a significant incremental expense to catch up our bonuses that will not be repeated in Q4, so there’s nothing of huge significance other than there are some of the cost actions that Steve referenced that we have reinstated to normalcy, so we did have some reductions in July on salaries and in Q4, those will be fully to where they were pre-pandemic, and then we did reinstate the 401K match late in Q3 and that will be fully reinstated in Q4. So there are a couple of what I’d call headwinds, but those are really just returning us to pre-pandemic levels, and then normally in Q4 we just have some other margin pressures, given the holidays and some other things that we manage through, but nothing of note. Finally, there is a small amount of incremental investment. I referenced on the things that we’re doing around supporting our consumer business. We want to continue to build that business. We think it’s going to be increasingly important, and so we do have the opportunity given our business performance to invest, and so there’s a little bit of commercial investment into our consumer business that’s a step up from where it’s been in Q3.
Operator: The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Pito Chickering: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions.  Two quick ones for you. Now that you’ve more experience with the preferred lab networks, what leverage do you think plays a bigger impact with changing consumer behavior? Is it the zero co-pays for the consumer or is it the lower admin burden from the referral sources? Also a quick follow-up on the core organic volumes - you mentioned seeing geographic pressure in New York City. Is geographic weakness a primary driver that you’re seeing across your book of business, or is it more broad-based specialties like Pantox that haven’t recovered yet? Thanks so much.
Stephen Rusckowski: We continue to work on our relationship with UnitedHealthcare. As we said, in ’19 we made some really good progress picking up share related to the PLN. We had a lot of things to do in the fall of 2019 related to employers, zero out of pocket and preauthorization work, and we really felt good about January and February. We actually did see a nice progression of our volumes and then we hit the pandemic in March.  We continue to work those programs and matter of fact, this week I was spending time with United on this and we continue to work on everything we can do to move more of their lab purchases to the PLN, and obviously specifically to us, and there will be other programs that we’re working with them by geography, by state to be able to make sure that employers and patients and integrated delivery systems understand the value of what we deliver. Remember if you go back to where we started, we believe that by the improvement in access with United and Verizon and Anthem in Georgia as of the time of our last investor day, it afforded us about a $4 billion opportunity in market, and we believe that we should be able to get about 25% of that. We received some of that in 2019 and we believe there’s more opportunity in front of us. So what I can share with you is we continue that work in 2020 and we do expect it will continue to help us pick up some share in ’21 to accelerate our growth.
Mark Guinan: I just want to remind everyone, Pito, that the zero out of pocket still has a ways to go, so they started with their fully insured small plans and then expanded it, and then it’s going to go out to the sponsored plans. Obviously that’s marketed to the employers who are paying those bills, and the good news is we’re collaborating with them on that and trying to demonstrate how that will save the employers a whole lot of money. To this point, most of the movement has been through other activity, things that United has done to encourage physicians to stop using out-of-network providers, having us go in and show them the benefits of moving that lab ordering to us and the PLN member, but still a lot of runway in front of us in terms of how that might benefit. The lower burden is really just a new thing. We’re putting in some pretty significant requirements around some of the higher cost testing, and they realize that two things - one is that the PLN members can really have more responsible panels or an approach to clinical testing. The second thing is obviously we have good prices as compared to some of the other providers, and we’ve mentioned in the past that some of the managed Medicaid payors, so outside of United, have used this approach in specifically toxicology to drive better value. You know, with toxicology exploding over the last couple years, they put in some very tight restrictions on utilization, and seeing that the national labs tend to do this responsibly and have better prices, they exempted us from a pre-auth. So not only does it make it easier on physicians and patients, but it tends to steer more work to us because the administrative burden is lower. United sees that in the same areas where they’re trying to control some of the growth in high cost testing, but that benefit to us is to come yet.
Operator: Next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Matt Larew: Good morning. We’re in the early weeks of the traditional flu season, so I had a couple questions. First, what are your expectations going in with respect to potentially higher vaccine rates or social distancing? What are you hearing from physicians about approaches to flu versus potentially flu with COVID, or flu-RSV-COVID combos in symptomatic versus asymptomatic, and then what are you hearing about with respect to reimbursement on those combo offerings versus the individual analytes? Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski: Matt, we’re watching it carefully. We believe that when somebody presents themselves with symptoms, they want to rule out COVID, and we believe that PCR testing will be the option. As we mentioned, we brought out a new solution which we feel really good about - with a single swab, you can test for influenza, you can also test for other viral and bacterial issues, and that is going to be very convenient for physicians just to quickly diagnose and then treat the patients effectively.  Now what you bring up, we’re watching it carefully because with all of us being socially distant and all of us doing a better job of hygiene and schools not being entirely back in session, it might actually lower the infection rate this year, but we’re not certain of that, and so we’re watching that. Mark, do you want to talk about reimbursement for some of the--
Mark Guinan: Yes, you know, it’s still to be determined. Basically for reference, CPT code 87631, which is the respiratory multiplex panel with three to five targets is $142 today; 87632, with six to 11 targets, is $218, and then 87631 reflux with 12 to 25 targets is $416, so still to be determined exactly where we come out on this. Still have negotiations with the commercial payors, but at least we could reference in the past for some of these multiplex panels, you know, the reimbursement is reasonable. 
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: Next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is now open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on a good quarter.  I guess my question to you guys, you talked about serology and how that plays into the 2021 outlook. How are you thinking about the ramp of that, and what are the conversations right now with payors on potential coverage or likely coverage for serology once the vaccine is out?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, we’re doing our share of serology, running around 10,000 per day. We’ve got plenty of capacity in front of us. We believe it’s going to play an increasingly important role as we get into 2021, as the vaccine becomes available. We’re actively engaged with those pharmaceutical companies that are doing the trials for the vaccine and trying to understand where we might play a role [indiscernible] either with the vaccine or post vaccine, and serology has a role there.  We’re also doing some serology population health testing. We’ve done some work for states and we’re doing work for the CDC, and we believe that that work will continue to give us a good handle on what is happening with the progression of disease and have an early warning signal if we’re moving in the wrong direction, so more to come. We’re working through that. We do believe it’s going to be a growing and bigger opportunity in 2021 and more visibility of that as we understand where the vaccine is, understand the progression of where we are with the pandemic.  Then also, we will be bringing new solutions out to the marketplace that will provide more and more utility around serology, and more to come on that. But we’re working on the science and we believe there’s more we can do to contribute towards the pandemic as we go, particularly as we see how the pandemic progresses.
Mark Guinan: In terms of discussions with the payors, it’s still early, Brian. There is not clarity around the exact role that serology is going to play, and while we believe there is going to be an important role, it’s not at a point where we’re in detailed discussions with the payors yet.
Operator: The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Derik de Bruin: Hey, great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a question, a quick question on the impact on the business from pooling. How much of the samples are being pooled right now, and what are the economics on that and the reimbursement for that? How much is your cost savings, and I guess how much of the volumes do you think can ultimately be pooled, realizing the fact is you’ve got to have low pandemic areas to do it. Just your thoughts on that for the business.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Remember we talked about 200,000 tests per day for capacity, and [indiscernible] resulted in the third quarter about 100,000 per day. Roughly 20% to 25% of that volume is done on what we call our LDTs, and that’s where we’ve been leveraging the pooling capability. It’s particularly useful. It has good improvements in productivity and efficiency where you have low prevalence populations because when you do the pooling, when one well lights up, you have to test for that well, and you get a few 14, 15% positivity rates in locations, the mask doesn’t mark it out any more, so we’re applying it in the right way. It’s primarily around our LDT portion of our capacity. What I mentioned in earlier comments was we’re looking at applying that to our IBD platform as well, and that will be helpful in moving our capacity from 200 up to 250.
Mark Guinan: Yes, and just to remind everyone, as Steve said, the efficiency is really highly dependent on the positivity rate, and while we do save on reagents, it’s not an order of magnitude less expensive. The real economic benefit of pooling comes from capacity increase, so our ability to do more testing and the margins we get on that testing, not a huge difference. There is a benefit but not a huge difference in the cost per individual test that we pool.
Operator: The next question is from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. I just want to go back to the guidance that Mark gave, or kind of preliminary thoughts for 2021, and just understand a couple things a little bit better. When we think about the base business, what’s your expectation around unemployment trends, and as we think about the near term, what we’ve seen in the last few months, do think that unemployment is having any impact on your core volume? Then secondly, when we think about COVID and we think about PCR testing persisting into 2021, do we think about that just in the first part of the year, and when we think about a potential vaccine, what are your thoughts around PCR testing? I understand your comments around serology, but how do we think about PCR testing playing into a vaccine?
Stephen Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start with ’21 comments and the economy?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so Lisa, it’s hard to know specifically what’s driving the dampened utilization. Certainly things have opened up a lot more than they were in the spring, so whereas physician offices were closed, I think there was a huge fear in a large part of the population around engaging with the healthcare system at all because of the risk potentially of catching COVID when you went into a physician office. While I wouldn’t suggest that’s eliminated, certainly that has improved dramatically, so there is some overhang left there certainly but the unemployment rate is probably a contributor right now - we don’t know for certain, and we wouldn’t expect that to change dramatically certainly in the next six months, or who knows how long before it might turn around. So we’re being cautious around our thinking for next year, and we wanted to share that. Obviously people will form their own opinions, but we would expect unemployment to have some dampening on utilization going into next year.  In terms of the COVID volumes, we haven’t modeled and we haven’t given guidance for ’21, but maybe three, six months ago some of us had hoped that COVID might be behind us this calendar year. Clearly, that does not look like it’s going to happen, but all this depends on how quickly the vaccines get rolled out, how effective they are, and even once they get rolled out, we see a role, so whether it’s a level of testing we’re seeing today or something a little less, we expect there to be a meaningful amount of COVID testing, including the PCR testing throughout a reasonable part of next year.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, and just to add to that, remember with the economy, and we saw this back in the Great Recession, whatever happens to the economy will affect access, and so access is important to us [indiscernible]. Second is consumer confidence, and we know a large portion of the population is paying for healthcare out of their own pocket, and therefore they’re going to think twice about utilizing it, so we are thinking about that as we think about models in ’21. Now with that said, if you look at where we are with our base business versus where it was and you think about the math for the full year, it should be an easy comparison, as Mark said in his comments about ’21. Even if it’s down versus ’19, just to look at the comparison of what the full year will be for ’20 versus ’21, given where we are right now, that makes for an easy comparison. As far as PCR, remember we brought out our first PCR test on March 9 and we’ve been ramping rapidly, so we have not had a full year from PCR. We’re hitting our stride, we’re building capacity because we do anticipate more demand, winter is coming and we’re all anticipating more demand as we enter the winter, clearly in the first quarter, and then we’ll start to see hopefully some of the vaccines. As we all know, those won’t be broadly deployed immediately and the pandemic and the virus will be with us for a large portion of ’21, so if you think about the full year of ’21 for COVID-19 versus what we did in 2020, there’s still going to be a lot of volume for testing and you have the full 12 months versus essentially a half year for PCR in 2020. It’s something to think about as you do your models.
Mark Guinan: Yes, and to Steve’s point, for this year based on our guidance expectations, we see our base volume down organically in the high teens, so even if it’s down a couple hundred basis points in 2021, it will still be an easy compare for the full year.
Operator: The last question is from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Mike Newshel: Thank you. Going back to the geographic differences on the core volume rebound you mentioned, just wondering if you’re seeing fluctuations tied specifically to where there are new COVID outbreaks. Is there patient behavior changing and affecting the core business when cases spike [indiscernible] or is that variation just more correlated to how far along local economies are into reopening? Is there volatility at a local level or is it just some states are bouncing back faster than others? 
Stephen Rusckowski: Well you know, it’s by states, really the big four states. California shut down first, we saw a steady rebound, they’re still not back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some of the large cities like LA. If you go into Texas, we actually saw a good rebound in Texas. We have a great presence in Texas, both in Houston and Dallas, and despite some of the flare-ups we saw in the summer, they still continue to be in the range of where we were pre-pandemic. Look at Florida - it went down in the spring into the summer, there’s still issues in Florida. We’re still not where they were pre-pandemic. Then if you go to the northeast, New York and Boston and Connecticut, actually we’ve seen some nice steady recovery with the exception of, as we’ve indicated earlier, New York City, but specific to the Borough of Manhattan. We still have a ways to go to recover there, so we’re watching those, particularly related to infection rates.  But where we have had some of these flare-ups, interesting enough, like in the States of Texas and Florida in the summer months, it did not have a negative of a consequence to our base business as we saw back in the spring, so we’re watching it carefully. But so far, we’re getting there. Then again, you can’t ignore that clinical franchise element of this because some of the portion of the buy-in effects are related to these specific businesses, like prescription drug monitoring, and there’s other issues related to what it takes to get those back to pre-pandemic levels that are not related to the geography at all. 
Mark Guinan: I can’t say they’re precisely negatively correlated, but actually that would be my representation. Areas with the lowest positivity rates, like New York, actually are down the most, so we haven’t seen a huge parallel movement between spikes in COVID over the last several months and a downturn in utilization. It actually has kind of gone in the opposite direction. 
Shawn Bevec: Okay, so thank you all for your questions. We appreciate your support on this call today and in general, and we wish you all a great day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results, include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and, or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic's severity and duration, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state, and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to base testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compounded annual growth rates. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in one of the most challenging periods of our history, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and expanded COVID-19 testing for the country, and delivered stronger than expected performance in the second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by COVID-19 testing and the rapid recovery of our base testing volume. I'm very proud of Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of healthcare, answering the call, and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on the second quarter results and our financial position. We have reinstated our financial outlook for the remainder of the year with a broad range, which reflects uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Mark will talk about our outlook in an underlying subject [ph] just in a few minutes. Our financial performance in the second quarter was stronger than anticipated, also lower than the same period of 2019. For the quarter, total revenues declined approximately 6% to $1.83 billion. Earnings per share decreased by approximately 10% on a reported basis, so $1.36; and approximately 18% on an adjusted basis, so $1.42. These results were driven by a strong bounce back in our base testing volumes for March and April, as the healthcare system began to resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries sooner than we had anticipated. Heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing helped partially offset the base volume decline as well. Demand came in from a number of areas with the continuing spread of the virus throughout most of the country, the pent-up need to test non-COVID-19 pre-surgical patients, people in high-risk populations like nursing homes and prisons, the proliferation of retail testing sites, and finally, employer interest in testing employees before they return to work. Quest Diagnostics has continued to play a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation. We performed roughly 8.5 million COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests, and more than 2.5 million antibody or serology tests. We now have the capacity to perform up to 130,000 molecular diagnostic tests today, double the capacity since mid-May. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform approximately 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Cumulatively, Quest has delivered nearly 20% of all the testing included in this country. Working together with large national retailers like Walmart and CVS, we've built a new model for consumers to access testing. We're also supporting HHS and state drive-through testing initiatives across the country. I'm very proud of the progress we have made in rapidly scaling up capacity since the pandemic began. However, demand for testing has soared in recent weeks. And we are providing testing results in about two days for the highest priority patients, and the average turnaround time for non-priority patients is at least seven days. So, we're doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular testing to patients and speed the delivery of test results. We continue to add testing platforms and work with our suppliers to ensure access to testing equipment, reagents, and personal protective equipment. We're exploring a range of new technology options, like last week, the FDA granted Quest the nation's first emergency use authorization to use specimen pooling for COVID-19 molecular testing. This technique, which is commonly used with blood banking, will help expand capacity, especially among populations with low estimates. Through our lab referral program, we're partnering with other quality laboratories to expand our available capacity. And in recognition of the magnitude of the current demand for testing, we have asked customers to help us prioritize patients we test for COVID-19 at this time. Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways over the last few months to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Our company has been central to the crisis response, and I'm proud of our employees on frontlines who are serving patients, customers, and communities every day. In June, we offered financial assistance to about 23,000 of our frontline colleagues and their supervisors to encourage increased expenses during the pandemic. In April, we took us a series of temporary workforce actions to manage our costs. These included the furloughs, reduced hours, and pay cuts for salaried employees. And then today, I am very pleased to report that a vast majority of these actions were reversed a month earlier to enable us to continue to respond to our customers' increased demand for testing. Since March, we've been fighting COVID-19, but we've also been focused on accelerating growth in the base business. And as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth are to grow more than 2% per year through accretive [indiscernible] acquisitions, to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems, to offer the broadest access to diagnostics innovation, be recognized as a consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services, and then finally, support population health and data analytics in extended care services. Now, let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Through the pandemic, the M&A environment understandably slowed. But despite that, we were able to complete the acquisition of a Memorial Hermann outreach business in April, and are pleased with the early progress. We also recently announced our plan to acquire all of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, or MACL. Once we complete this transaction expected this quarter, Quest will wholly own MACL's laboratory in Indianapolis, and about 50 patient service centers across Indiana. Also, we'll provide professional lab services under a long-term agreement for 30 hospital labs owned and operated by MACL founding hospitals, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategies. At the same time, we know that all our regional laboratories have had their own challenges. This could also produce more opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If anything, the pandemic could be an additional catalyst to help drive industry consolidation. Some transactions in the pipeline that were paused because of the pandemic are being revisited, based on the new realities that the healthcare system is experiencing at this time. We also continue to make progress on our health plans strategy. We entered our second year of being a member of your UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network, and we are pleased with the results to date. We have met or exceeded key quality metrics, such as electronic ordering and resulting, and patient service center appointment rates. We've also secured business for more than 180 out of network UHC labs, saving money for patients and lowering the overall cost of care. We look forward to making continued progress with the Preferred Lab Network in the second year. Over the last few months, we've seen a remarkable surge in the sign-ups of our MyQuest patient portal. Today, more than 11 million patients have a MyQuest account to make appointments and receive their results through their smartphone or computer. Since late April, we've seen a more than three-fold increase in weekly registrations, which accelerated at the end of the second quarter. We believe that our patients see and appreciate the ease and convenience of our consumer experience. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 5.7% compared to the prior year. Although revenue declined year-over-year, our second quarter results were stronger than we communicated back in June, reflecting the stronger than expected recovery in base testing volumes, as well as growing demand for COVID-19 testing services. Volumes, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 17.7% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 50 basis points. Testing volumes in the company's base business declined approximately 34% versus the prior year. In April, base volumes declined in excess of 50% compared to last year, as stay at home measures were implemented across the U.S., hospitals began to limit elective procedures, and many physician offices were temporarily closed for business. Base volume trends began to improve in May, down more than 30%, as stay at home measures [Technical Difficulty], many hospitals reintroduced elective procedures, and some physician offices reopened. The base volume recovery continued in June, down less than 15%, as the trends in May gained momentum. Throughout the quarter, the strongest recoveries were observed in the states that opened more quickly than others, such as Texas and Florida. As we exited June, base volume declines had moderated to approximately high single digits. However, due to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases across the country and the rollback of several state reopening plans, we have seen a slight softening of our base business in early July. While base testing volumes remain down year-over-year, COVID-19 testing was a meaningful offset in the second quarter. We exited the second quarter averaging approximately 110,000 and 26,000 COVID-19 molecular and serology tests respectively each day. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 15.3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing. Unit price headwinds were slightly less than 2% in the second quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This includes the ongoing impact PAMA. Reported operating income was $283 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $307 million or 15.7% of revenues last year. Reported operating income second quarter includes $65 million of proceeds from the CARES Act. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $294 million or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $352 million or 18% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was due to the significant decline in revenue associated with our base testing volumes, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and our cost reduction actions. Adjusted operating income does not include proceeds from the CARES Act. Reported EPS was $1.36 in the quarter, compared to $1.51 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.42, compared to $1.73 last year. Cash provided by operations was $602 million year-to-date through June 30, versus $596 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the second quarter included the $65 million of provider disbursements under the CARES Act I just mentioned. Our financial position remains very strong. During the second quarter, we amended our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility. We completed a $550 million debt offering in May, which may be used to redeem or repay our senior notes due in 2021. Given the better than expected second quarter results, our debt to EBITDA ratio was only slightly above where we ended Q1. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Finally, our Board of Directors remains committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. This morning, we reissued our full-year 2020 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $8 billion and $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 11.3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.66 and $7.66, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.60 and $8.60 8 per share. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.25 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and 400 million. We continue to operate under extremely uncertain conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is evident in the wider than usual outlook ranges we shared in our quarterly press release today. As you consider our new 2020 outlook, I'd like to share the following considerations and assumptions. First, regarding base testing volumes, we expect base testing volumes to remain below prior year levels for the remainder of the year. While the magnitude of the year-over-year decline is likely to fluctuate geographically as states throttle reopening phases, our current outlook does not contemplate the magnitude of base volume declines observed in April and May, and the low end of the outlook assumes an average 20% decline in base testing volumes through the remainder of the year. Regarding molecular COVID-19 testing demand and capacity, we continue to drive towards molecular COVID-19 testing capacity of 150,000 tests per day over the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind this represents peak capacity, operating under optimal conditions. Due to various factors, such as routine maintenance and planned downtime, we generally operate at somewhat under peak capacity. We expect demand for molecular COVID-19 testing to remain high, at least through the third quarter. Please note, that the low end of our outlook assumes recent molecular COVID-19 testing volume trends continue at a similar level throughout the third quarter and then step down in the fourth quarter. Regarding Medicare reimbursement from the molecular COVID-19 testing the existing $100 Medicare reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing is tied to the public health emergency declared by HHS. HHS officials have recently indicated they plan to extend the public health emergency for an additional 90 days beyond the current expiration of July 25. Our outlook assumes this level of reimbursement continues through late October. To be clear, we believe HHS to continue the Public Health Emergency while the crisis continues and we are not aware of any plans for it to end. Regarding COVID-19 serology testing, COVID-19 serology testing also continues to help offset declines in base testing volumes. We continue to believe there is meaningful potential within serology testing but rising customer demand remains in front of us. Regarding the cost actions we've undertaken, as Steve mentioned, we have rolled back many of these cost actions we took in April with most remaining actions expected end of July. Finally, as we develop this outlook we contemplated a range of potential outcomes in the second half of 2020. The low end assumes the variability and uncertainty I just described. We have greater degree of visibility in the third quarter and there are far more unknowns in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we currently expect third quarter results to be stronger than the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. With the sunrise in the second quarter, Quest Diagnostics step up and rapidly expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered stronger than expected performance. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to expand COVID-19 testing capacity while also serving the unmet needs of healthcare community and drive our strategy to accelerate growth. We reinstated our financial outlook for the full year of 2020 with the broad range, which reflects the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Finally, I'm very proud of our Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of health care, answering the call and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Great, thank you. Again, I want to thank everyone across for what they're doing. I have two questions regarding testing. Could you clarify the comments you made on serology testing, the assumptions in guidance? I think you used the words, it's in front of us. Does that mean you do not have a meaningful contribution for serology testing in 2020 and if so do you think it's more of a 2021 contribution when the vaccine comes out? Then my second question would be around just molecular testing, the pooling that you announced Monday. Should we think about that as just the ability to turn around faster or do you ultimately think it's going to increase the capacity over the 100 to 2000 per day? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: So it sounds good. Well, on serology we are doing serology as we speak. We brought that up in April. We have in our outlook for the year some serology volume. What I will say is there is growing evidence of the value of serology. There has been some debate of the evidence that would suggest if you have the antibodies that, in fact, it provides the ability for a period of time. It is clear that people are starting to weigh in that, in fact, those antibodies do provide confidence that there will not be a re-infection. As that confidence builds and as we get into the fall and into next year, I do believe there will be a pickup in serology particularly as we start to think about who should get the vaccine and who should not get the vaccine. So I think some of that is in front of us, but we do have some of that in our outlook. As far as molecular testing and pooling in the numbers that I provided particularly getting to 150,000 per day in a couple of weeks, some portion of that will be driven by the opportunities we see with pooling. Some portion of that is also driven by adding new systems and new resources to increase our capacity. What I'll say is we're not stopping there. There's opportunities in front of us beyond that 150,000.
Mark Guinan: I just would like to add in certainly, serology testing is meaningful and we shared in Steve's prepared remarks we've done 2.5 million. That's certainly meaningful. It's just different than molecular where the demand is exceeding our capacity. We had shared earlier that we had capacity of 200,000 serology tests a day with an expectation that demand could possibly be at that level. For various reasons, it's nowhere near that. But certainly, the amount of serology testing we're doing is very meaningful to Quest and is one of the offsets to the base business decline right now.
Ann Hynes: All right, thanks.
Operator: Next, we have Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Thanks for the question. I also wanted to ask about the molecular testing. Can you talk a little bit about how you referral patterns have looked throughout the quarter and what percentage of that testing volume is now coming from return-to-work? My thought process was that if you are currently utilizing close to full capacity in the molecular side and the return to work opportunity is still largely in front of you, you potentially have pretty high visibility even going out into Q4, one way or another, as there sort of a natural hedge built in there. Then just as my follow-up, it looks like DSOs increased very meaningfully during the quarter. I was hoping you could discuss that a little bit and whether you're seeing any collection challenges or delays with the COVID testing. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. First, as far as demand, where is it coming from. In our prepared remarks, we took about the different elements of demand and what I'll share with you is that we have demand right now that is exceeding our capacity and we're doing what we can to obviously bring up the capacity. Also, we said in prepared remarks is working with our customers and clients on prioritizing those specimens that we're getting in to make sure we're testing the most urgent need in the country and we're making progress. As we bring up the capacity and we manage our demand over the next several weeks and get into August, we believe as we get through August and into September, we'll have a higher level of capacity, but also a higher level of demand and we'll be able to get to turnaround times that are in the acceptable levels that we've had in the past. So it's in front of us. We're working hard getting there and I think all elements that you described will allow us to be successful through the next several weeks. As far as demand, Steve, you talked about return to work programs. It's starting to come into our demand. We're managing it with employers. We also see in front of us the demand for return to universities and colleges. There'll be a lot of testing required in the month of August around that. We also see physicians bringing up their offices and more physicians are actually sending us persons that they've collected. So we see that adding to the demand. Then there has been broader access and broader availability of testing where people have now at access to asymptomatic testing and very convenient locations. Then I mentioned that our remarks the access we provided with CVS stores and also with Walmart has increased the demand. So, I would say across the board, it's growing in all areas. We do believe though as we get into the September months when we hope there is still a number of employers that are bringing employees back to the office or to work that we are going to be in a place where our capacity will meet the demand that we see in our funnels.
Mark Guinan: Stephen, did you ask about pacing concessions? I didn't quite pick up your last question.
Stephen Baxter: Yes. It just looks to me that the DSOs were up a bit maybe [ph] 5 days -- maybe sequentially something like. I just want to know whether COVID testing or other collection and things with you guys might want to talk about with these things.
Mark Guinan: That's really formulaic approach. Cash collections are stronger as expected. We did have some delayed billing around COVID testing because the payers needed to update their systems and many of them needed 30 days or more to do that so we were holding on some billing, but I can assure you that at this point in terms of our reserves and our cash collections and everything we're very, very comfortable with where we're in our balance sheet. As you can see the operating cash flow was benefited from the CARES Act. $65 million was pretty strong year-over-year despite the depressed volumes revenues and earnings in the second quarter.
Stephen Baxter: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Hey, good morning. So first of all, congrats on the trajectory. Wanted to get your thoughts on one of the top questions I've been getting to the labs, which is how can you convert the short-term opportunity from testing and make your long-term growth rate more durably higher? I was curious to get your take on that. And then, Mark, what does the guidance assume for incremental margins on testing in the second half versus reinvestment and are there any things that you can accelerate to try and improve the longer term trajectory of the business?
Steve Rusckowski: Let me start with we're going into second half and clearly, our base business is going to continue to be down versus 2019. We are hopeful that we'll start to continue to see some recovery in the back half of the year, but we're not necessarily contemplating any of that in our outlook for 2020. As we get into 2021 it goes back to us continue to work our strategy for accelerated growth and we do believe we have the right strategies and we wanted to share with you in our prepared remarks that we're working those hard. I actually believe that the strategies are actually more appropriate given the pandemic than they were before. So if you think through those, one is, we do believe there could be more acquisitions in front of us for growth through acquisitions. We announced the two deals recently that will prepare us nicely in the back half of the year for growth through acquisitions and sets us up for 2021 too with that carry over on that and the funnel that we're seeing and we're going to push on that front. It will give us some nice growth through acquisitions as we keep on working those in the back half help us in 2021. Second is as far as organic growth in our base business, we continue to work our relationships with the health plans. I would say that our work in the preferred lab network with United is going well. We're going to continue to gain share with them and we're pushing that same type of approach in concept with many peers throughout our route or contracts and we believe there is an opportunity for us to pick up share as we've said in our strategy. We also continue to work with hospitals. We talked about the Mako systems, professional lab services deal. We have a number that are being finalized as we speak that we feel good about and those will give us continued organic growth next year. Then also as we think about our advanced diagnostics and the capabilities we're bringing to the marketplace with gene sequencing and consumer genetic offerings, we believe those strategies will give us some nice opportunities for continued growth next year. So we're continuing to push on the base business growth platform. At the same time, we'll have some natural recovery in our base business as the economy and as healthcare recovers and also through acquisitions. We think we'll be in a good place as we get into 2021 to deliver on that objective that we have of 2% growth through acquisitions. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Sure. To answer your EBIT question about margin dropdown, Jack. As we've shared in the past in a short window, we are a highly fixed cost business on our base business, so generally any plus or minus will be 80% or so drop through. It's really supplies and reagents that are the variable costs. The most of it, everything from their logistics infrastructure to phlebotomy to even largely the labour in the laboratory in a window is fixed so variation, good or bad around the base business has a very high drop through. Although we certainly have good margins on our COVID testing there is more variable cost in the COVID testing so it's not quite as high a variable margin on any sort of plus or minus is from our base case, but still very attractive.
Jack Meehan: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So my question is on the guidance. Mark, you obviously highlighted the assumptions on the low end of the range. Just trying to understand better what you assuming at the high end and especially when we think about molecular testing. I think you're expecting that at the low end that there is going to be a step down in the fourth quarter. So just trying to understand the rationale for that. What type of environment do you see where we're going to see a step down in molecular? What are you assuming at the high end? Then, when we think about just the future of COVID-19 addressable market in relation to vaccine administration as it relates to the molecular are you in any conversations with the vaccine manufacturers and in how do you think -- what do you think the role of testing will be in relation to the vaccine?
Mark Guinan: I'll let you handle the vaccine question, then I'll just talk about the assumptions. Ricky, I appreciate the question. If there is one thing that has been demonstrated over the last several months is we don't have the ability to predict some of these things so I don't think any of us here envisioned a 50% decline in our business in April even when the pandemic first started. Then on the other side, we didn't expect the fast recovery that we saw throughout May and June, given what had happened in April. So we want to recognize that some of these things are out of our control and we want to talk about some ranges of potential outcomes and how they might impact our financial results to take away a little bit and hopefully a large degree of that uncertainty, we've been living with over the last couple of months where people were wondering what might be happening at Quest. But when we talk about PCR molecular volumes falling off in Q4, it's not because we have a vision of that happening, but we had to make some assumptions in the guidance. Since that's several months away and we've shown that even a month or two in the future it's hard to predict that, we didn't expect the surge in June that happened. Therefore we're just being I think appropriately cautious and explaining what those assumptions are, so we don't have any sense that it will follow-up. I think all of us for society are hoping it will follow-up as the infection rate dampens but also note that some of the non-clinical work, the work we're doing for return-to-work for employers and students should be heavy in Q3 and some of that we might expect to step down in Q4. So, that is one driver that might lead you to believe that demand would dampen a little bit in Q4, but it's not as if we know how the virus is going to proceed and the infection rate and certainly some people would say that when we get the flu season, we might even have another spike. So we don't know but we wanted to be very clear around those assumptions.
Steve Rusckowski: Ricky, on your question about next year and specifically the vaccine. So, first of all, we believe there will be COVID-19 testing next year in 2021. Second is, if we assume we'll have a vaccine next year or sometime, and you go back to what I said earlier about the role of serology and evaluating and prioritizing who should get the vaccine, we do believe there will be a role of testing in 2021 for us. Then finally, in terms of working with those that are developing the vaccine, we are actively in conversations of using our data in a productive way to recruit patients. Some of this is around the vaccine development but also using our data to help with the donation of plasma for the country. So, good use of our data, which is part of our strategy again for growth -- the user data, the smart way as a diagnostic information services provider to help with the pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Hey, good morning. Sorry to harp on this, but I do want to go back to the guidance. Because when you first updated in early June, you expected breakeven is slightly positive for the quarter, you obviously ended up at $1.42. That essentially implies all of the two key earnings came in June. So if I just run rate that number for six months, I'm already at $8.40 [ph] in earnings before I even contemplate the over $2 you put up in the first half. So -- and again, my guess is COVID testing trajectory moves higher and assuming some continued core recovers, I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the offsets or the headwinds on what appears a pretty extremely conservative range, particularly at the lower end, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.
Mark Guinan: Well, we laid out for you in pretty detailed fashion in the low end. So you can take a look at those assumptions. And,, you can have your own point of view, and that's why we wanted to be very, very clear about that assumption. So your notion that Q2 earnings were all pretty much in June is spot on. And the issue with multiplying that times six for the back half would be a couple things. One is our base business was down exiting the month high single digits of average 15 in June. And the question is, is that sustainable? We'll take a step back, we'll look at worse. We don't know. So certainly, if it were to improve, or were to hold for the whole six months, would say down 10% versus that 20% assumption on our floor, that would make a material difference for the business. And as I just described, at an 80% drop down, you can do some of the math, but our core business was about $2 billion on quarter before COVID. So you know, 1000 basis points is a pretty significant difference on revenue and OM. On the PCR, we shared that we're assuming the volumes dropped down in Q4, not because we have any foreknowledge, but because as I said, return to work and back to school will largely be behind us, and because we don't know. So we want to be cautious about putting on a guidance that counts on the level of PCR testing that at this point is unpredictable. Obviously, we go through Q3 and we get better knowledge towards Q4 and see a need to update that, we would do so. But, given how things have moved around, we want to be really careful. The other thing is, as I said, we fully expect, if we continue to have high levels of COVID and ease-of-testing [ph] that the Federal Emergency will continue, but because that's unpredictable, it could actually be revoked at any time. We want to be very careful about assumptions on reimbursement for our molecular tests. And so, at this point, we're only building in that reimbursement through a 90-day extension, since that's been voiced by HHS. And while we would hope and expect if COVID continues that that reimbursement will continue into Q4, that would make a very significant difference as well. But that is not in either the bottom or the high-end of our current guidance.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for you, back to the pooling option, that I would have assumed a larger multiplier effect for geographic areas with a low posit testing rates. As you progress into the third quarter, is there a reason why that can't scale to provide a much larger multiplier effect? And what would hold it back from being that large of an impact? And the second question is, as we look into 2021, and if there's a decline in COVID testing, both molecular and serology in the US, is there any discussions about providing testing capabilities for other countries that don't have the testing infrastructure?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start with pooling. So what you mentioned is true, that is, it's more beneficial in areas that have low prevalence. We've started to ramp up our capacity that will be driven for getting some nice boost in our capacity, which we're planning for, as I mentioned, to get to that 150 [ph] in a couple of weeks. So we're going to apply those concepts in our laboratory developed test locations and try to steer it towards the low prevalence areas to be able to get the best bang for the buck. So we'll push that and the multiplier is considerable when you have low prevalence, so that would be very helpful to bringing up our capacity. We'll keep on pushing on it. As far as testing for non-US geographies, frankly, we are focused entirely for all-intensive purposes on the US. We could consider it in 2021, but it's not in our plans right now and we haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it, as we sit here dealing with the pandemic in the US.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks, and thanks for taking my call. I want to get to the assumption around the vaccine and how to think about this. So if we were to assume a vaccine becomes available January 1, there's a billion doses or whatever the number might be, how do you anticipate the vaccine being distributed and administered along with testing? Are you suggesting that first people would get serology testing to figure out who would need the vaccine or? We can imagine that this vaccine is going to be administered quickly to the entire population. So take me through how you would expect to model out the administration of the vaccine along with testing.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, well, obviously, this is beyond Quest Diagnostics and rationing or prioritizing who should get it first, and what's the progression and how you distribute it throughout the United States. But like with other vaccines, you'd like to get it to the higher-risk groups. And the higher risk groups are those groups that we actually tested initially, higher on the priority list for COVID testing. And so, those were with pre-existing conditions, over the age of 65, and obviously, people that have been compromised with other respiratory illnesses in the past. So independent of serology and antibody testing, my assumption would be those at-risk groups would be high on the priority list. And then, the second priority list would be everyone else. And if, in fact, you were to test positive for the antibodies, then my sense is there will be evidence at that point that will suggest that, in fact, you'll have immunity for a period of time. And the question will be, how much of this would be public policy versus independent choice of whether you want to have the vaccine or not. That's all speculative on my part, a lot to be determined. First of all, where the vaccine will come from, when it's going to be available, how much will the US get. And also, this is going to be I'm sure debated throughout the United States as we get into it.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. Steve, I just wanted to follow back up on reimbursement. So, you talked about Medicare. Can you talk about the commercial market? So, it's the anticipation that the commercial market will just follow Medicare through the emergency pricing and what's your anticipation post-emergency pricing, should it be rolled back, number one. And number two, we've heard in the market that some of the health plans are pushing back on multiple tests done on individuals. What's been your experience so far?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, sure. So first of all, we do have an assumption that commercial rates are aligned with Medicare rates and, Mark, why don't you just remind everyone what we have in the outlook going forward as far as our assumptions for reimbursement?
Mark Guinan: So we -- the emergency use -- obviously the Federal Emergency expires on July 25th. HHS has expressed a view that they're going to extend that 90 days, so we've built that $100 price which is not our AWR, you know, we don't fully get $100; but that $100 priced into our -- pretty much our full book. And so, the commercial as we shared previously, the commercial payers pretty much fell in line with the Medicare reimbursement rates as a couple of additional state Medicaid plans that didn't quite get there. But for the most part, we get that price from everybody, regardless of who they are. Therefore, we would expect that to continue. So, as long as the Medicare rate stays up, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be some pressure, but we would expect the commercial payers to stay in line with that, because obviously, if it stays, there's a federal emergency, and it'd be hard to argue. They should be cutting the rate for a test that's quite so important. And nonetheless, we will get some pressure. Once we get through that, where the commercial rates end up, obviously, we will take a position that says it shouldn't be less than Medicare. It will be very transparent with what our costs are and the continued importance of that test, even post-emergency and we'll do our best to keep it at the Medicare rate and not something less than that. But that's still -- it's obviously still in front of us.
Steve Rusckowski: As far as payment policy, reimbursement policy, it is evolving. What I'll share is that frequency policies, first of all, as we all know, you could test negative one week and the next week, it'd be positive. So therefore, it's quite important that people feel that they should get tested if they've been exposed, and if, in fact, they believe that they might have some early symptoms. So, we'll continue to take that as the position and I think by and large people support that notion, but you have seen positions taken on return-to-work programs that employers are moving with, and in many cases, these employees are self-insured. So it's sort of a moot issue, what pocket it comes from. But for those fully insured employers, there is positions by some of the insurers that that's not included in their healthcare reimbursement policies. So therefore, it should be paid for by the employers. And then equally with universities and colleges, whether the students -- free on campus testing is included in the reimbursement like a physical would be, if they're going back to school or playing sports or going -- there's some debate around that. So I would say, characterize it as people are debating some of this. We're seeing kind of a growing trend with some of this. And then, also as we evolve, we're trying to understand who should get tested and who should not get tested. There is even some question of whether, after you've been tested positive and out for 14 days right now, most people are operating on a protocol that you get retested again, but there's some views that maybe that second test to verify your negative is not of great value, and therefore, this might help reduce the demand that we have on the system right now. So that's being debated, as well. So it's evolving, a lot of discussion. And Mark, anything you'd like to add to reimbursement in general on COVID?
Mark Guinan: I would just add that we have not had a significant amount, it would be very few of any denials or frequency limitations. So, while things might evolve, Lisa, to this point, we've not run into issues with the payers around frequency for the molecular tests, and for the return-to-work and back-to-school programs, we are not taking the risk on those. So we are either arranging client bill where we get paid directly contractually by the customer, or in some cases where they think they have coverage from the payer, we have a fall back to where, if we do get a denial, then we have a right to bill the client directly. So, we think we're protecting ourselves for the financial standpoint, we have not run into headwinds less far from the payers on frequency [indiscernible].
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Larew from William Blair. Your line is open.
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about how pair mix is trending in the base business, obviously, with the rising unemployment, but also, I suspect that patients in the commercial population may have been quicker to seek services as restrictions were relaxed, and I wanted to follow up on the opportunity for back-to-work and back-to-school. Just curious what discussions you've had and what role lab-based testing might play versus rapid testing? And then, perhaps there is an opportunity for Quest to play a role model not only in testing, but managing the testing strategies for employers, cities or companies, or schools?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take the first part of this around payments? I think that was the question.
Mark Guinan: Yes, I'm sorry, Matt, what is your specific question? Can you repeat it?
Matt Larew: Sure. Just payer mix; how that trended through the quarter in the base business?
Mark Guinan: Yes, payer mix did not change materially. The one thing we did see was an increase in uninsured. So beyond that, I don't think there was any -- and we rarely see -- given our size, we rarely see material changes of payer mix and this was no exception. So certainly, the drop in utilization did not impact people with certain payers more than others. The one that we did see was more uninsured.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Matt. On return to work programs and university role of let's say point of care devices, we are looking at all those devices and where they can help us, particularly around surveillance. And what we're finding for the initial testing, if you will, the gold standard is the PCR test for like a diagnostic workup and then secondly is for serology or blood based test is the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of both those are the best. Still to this day, and there are few devices -- there are a few devices that are coming to the marketplace that are -- that are offering we think an opportunity for us to include that in our services that we provide to both employers and to universities, specifically. Some of the antigen devices are coming to the marketplace we're looking at, you know those devices and some of the sensitivity around 85% which is lower than our sensitivity but for surveillance and in combination with possibly serology and just overall biometric screening of some form, it could be a helpful set of tools for us to manage a population over time. So, we are thinking about how we'll include those in our services to employers and also to universities as they have surveillance for their populations going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Brian
Mark Guinan: Hi, Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: [Technical Difficulty].
Steve Rusckowski: Brian, you're breaking up.
Brian Tanquilut: I'm sorry. Yes, how's this? Better?
Steve Rusckowski: Much better, much better. Yes.
Brian Tanquilut: Okay. Yes. So how do you think about the strategy in terms of balancing, increasing capacity beyond that 150,000 tests per day versus the uncertainty of not knowing how big this opportunity really could be? And what are the limiting factors right now that prevent you from pushing that up to say 200 or 250 a day?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, on my earlier remarks, we are going to push it beyond 150. And we do see capacity -- excuse me do we do see demand going forward, that's going to be beyond 150. And we do believe we'll get to a point where our capacity will meet that demand. And so we will get there. We'll go beyond the 150. And the limiting factors are, you know, combination of machines. So getting, you know, the IVD test systems and laboratory test equipment, and particularly for laboratory developed tests. It's not just the platforms, the PCR platforms, but in our setup, you know, there's actually two other pieces that you need to consider. It's the extraction and then second is the liquid handling. And it's been some machine constraints on us for getting those systems to be able to bring up -- bring up more and more capacity, but we're working with all our suppliers to get as much as we can get to bring our capacity and take it beyond the 150. The second is just manpower. Yes, we're running 24x7. And as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, doing 8.5 million tests over the last four months, our teams are working nonstop. Remember, this is in our microbiology department that has gone from the backwater of the laboratory to front and center. And we have capacity limits around the people and those that are trained adequately to deliver on this. And then third is just, you know, physically we need to get, you know these systems in place, we need to have the adequate controls and training in place. And that just takes some time. And then fourth is, you know, the reagents. We are rate limited by how much juice we get to run all our different platform. And we're working with our suppliers and getting more. We have had some shortages with some of the suppliers and that has not helped our ability to deliver results. And so we're working actively to, you know, get them to, first of all, give us more and then secondly to be reliable, what they commit to delivering again. So now, I will also say that everyone is working incredibly well together, the IVD manufacturers working with the task force, White House working at future ideas of where we can get more capacity, we're all pushing hard to get more and more capacity. But to answer your question, those are the rate limiting factors around what we need to do to get beyond 150. But we will get it beyond 150. That's where we want to be to be able to meet the demand we see, particularly as we get into the late August, early September time.
Mark Guinan: And Brian, you know, to be clear, you didn't ask this directly, but we are not being conservative. We are doing everything we can. The challenges are not financial, you know, willingness to spend more capital or for that matter, operational expense to get things up and running. They're all operational in our ability to get more equipment and, as Steve said, multiple pieces of equipment, and to get them operating and to get the people who are trained to do it. And we are, you know, moving as quickly as possible. As you said, we doubled our capacity from mid-May, you know, we're expecting another 20,000 per day increase from where we are today over the next several weeks. And then as Steve said, we're going to go beyond that. So there's no, you know, hesitancy to add capacity because of uncertainty and demand. We're doing everything we can to increase our capacity and certainly to reduce turnaround times.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thank you very much. Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping first. I know you said that your guidance assumes PCR volumes declined in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just curious can you give us a sense on how much what you're expecting for average daily volume in PCR in 4Q that's implicit in your guidance assumption?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so, you know, Eric, I'm sure you can appreciate that, you know, it's not as if we have a point estimate, forecasts, you know, for every number within that range or even the high-end range, because we've got, you know, multiple factors that can move things material, you know, certainly as we mentioned, the base volume, decline or improvement relative to our assumptions is very material to the outcome. And then that PCR, you know, volume is very, very material, as well. And then finally, the reimbursement rate, you know, beyond the 90-day extension is very, very important. So, you know, there's multi variable so, you know, I really can't answer directly, but, you know, specific number because, you know, we're running scenario planning, but I would tell you that at this point, we have a significant reduction in Q4 demand to get to these guidance numbers. So it's not small, it's fairly significant. And again, not because we know that's what's going to happen, but just given the uncertainty of the volumes and the knowledge that the return to work and back to school volumes will largely be gone by Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. Two questions. The first one being, can you give a little bit of color on some of the rebounds in the different categories? And then you've noted some softening in July. So can you talk about what you've sort of seen oncology versus clinchem versus pathology, just to give us a flavor on how you're seeing sort of hiccups?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So let me characterize it this way; in primary care, I'll put OB/GYNs [ph] in that as well. We've seen a nice rebound as physicians have opened back up their offices and call back some of their patients. In some cases they have extended hours; so we've seen a nice bounce back on that piece of our demand. Secondly, as we are seeing some nice recovery in some of those -- some of those procedures that might have been pent-up and our pathology tissues have actually rebounded in a good way. We're not sure it's entirely sustainable because there might be some of this is reacted to the pent-up demand that is coming back to us that we lost in April and May and we started to see it in June that will come into the summer. And that's why when we talk about outlook, we are cautious to make sure that we're not taking the June run rate as our run rate forever in the summer. We actually might see some slowdown related to that being absorbed, if you will, through the system. And then we'll get to the run rate that we should expect for a reasonable period of time in Q3. And then, some of our other businesses; we have our life insurance business, frankly, that's down considerably, we haven't seen a big recovery there. Our pre-employment drug testing business is starting to come back as employers start to hire people but is down considerably versus 2019. Our employer population health business where we do wellness programs for employers is down considerably, many of those events have been cancelled. So, I would say it's really a wide variation with the best being primary care and the worst being those that are tied to the economy, and in general, constraints around normal programs like life insurance and wellness and hiring people. So Mark, anything you'd like to add that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. I would just add that most of our base business has come back proportionally. As Steve said, oncology has really picked up recently over the last couple of weeks; we'll see how much of that was deferred pent-up demand. But the one category, it's not just in pre-employment but prescription drug monitoring; so the whole drug testing area, that's lagged a little bit some of the other franchises within the base business, not just in our employer business.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Mike Newshel: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on pooling. Is there a specific positivity rate threshold you have in mind where pooling makes sense in a particular state and region? And I know you get full reimbursement for each specimen, but how much does pooling change your cost structure? Is there a big incremental margin difference versus testing single specimens?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, you know, think about, you know, the best is obviously the lowest and where we pool, and we could put four specimens in a well, you know, like quadruples, your throughput per batch, if you will, and if there is zero positives, then you get it all. Where you have positives within that run, you have to test those -- that whole well, and, you know, that obviously starts to eat into the productivity game. So, the best is lower than 2%. We actually have a number of states and geographies that are in that range. Actually, right now the Northeast is doing quite well. We hope that is sustained. And then, as you start to go up to high single digits, it starts to lose it's effectiveness because of all the retesting you need to do. So clearly, less than 5% is in the sweet spot, and greater than 5% starts to get marginally worth it. But we have plenty -- if we look at pooling; again, pooling is applied to our laboratory developed tests, it's a piece of our capacity, it's going to give us more capacity to get us to that 150, and also, we believe beyond. But we're not just doing pooling to get more capacity, we're adding new systems and processes and people everything we talked about earlier. So, it will give us some of the capacity but there's other things we're doing as well.
Mark Guinan: And just a reminder, that pooling is only currently possible on our LDT. And so therefore, you know, it's not as if it's going to be an expander across our whole network, and we can prioritize low prevalence areas or that LDT to a certain extent or to a large extent. And so to Steve's point, we're going to target the areas that we currently have low positivity rates. But the biggest benefit is while we do get costs -- some cost savings on reagents when you can do four samples at once instead of a single one, even despite some retesting; it's really the benefit of the capacity. So, being able to serve more people with the same equipments and more patients is really the benefit, much larger, although there is a certainly a cost of sales savings that comes with pooling.
Operator: And we have no other questions. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. Well, we appreciate the time on the phone. We appreciate the extent of your interest in our business. And we hope you, like us, are appreciative of everyone at Quest and what we're doing, and we appreciate your support as well. So have a great day everybody.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are definitely living in extraordinary times. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and engage with one another. While the crisis will likely continue to impact our lives in the weeks and months ahead, one thing we can be highly certain of -- we will get through this.So this morning, I will discuss our performance before the crisis hit, the impact the crisis has had in our role in it, and the actions we are taking to mitigate the impact going forward. And then Mark will provide more detail on the first quarter results and our financial position.Our financial performance in the first quarter was off to a strong start in January and February. Through February year-to-date, total revenues grew more than 4%. Total revenues grew more than 6%. Even after adjusting for the calendar benefit and favorable weather in the first two months of the year, organic volume grew more than 4%.However, in March, social distancing and shelter-in-place measures were instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19 and we began to see substantial declines in our business. In the last two weeks of the quarter, we experienced a reduction of volumes in excess of 40%.We saw the impact across all metropolitan markets, not just in hot spots like New York City. In April, volume declines continue to intensify as we are seeing signs that volume declines are bottoming out at around 50% to 60%. As you know, Quest Diagnostics has played a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation.Since we launched COVID-19 testing with a molecular laboratory developed tests, performed at our Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory at San Juan Capistrano, California. We have performed and reported results of nearly 1 million test to providers and patients across the United States. This is approximately a quarter of all testing done in the United States.We continue to provide testing for -- from 12 laboratories. Through these laboratories who are now able to perform more than 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day. We've also limited our backlog with a current turnaround time of one to two days and less than one day for priority hospital patients.We’ve maximized our output by effectively managing the global supply chain. This has enabled us to have sufficient supplies to collect specimens for patients, runner test and also protect our employees. This has been a team effort that requires a great deal of collaboration.Since early March, we've been in regular contact with the federal government and state and local governments. And this has happened at all levels. We're working closely together with our payers, IVD manufacturers, retailers and our trade associations to bring as much testing capacity as possible to the American people.We've also joined forces with Walmart to make our drive through testing sites available to anyone who may be exhibiting symptoms of the virus, as well as all health care workers and first responders, whether or not they're exhibiting symptoms. We're currently operating in approximately 10 sites in 5 states and have line of sight to approximately 20 locations by the end of the month. There are no out-of-pocket costs for testing at these sites.We're also supporting state and local government COVID-19 testing efforts across the country. Finally, we are pleased to see CMS decide to increase the reimbursement for high throughput molecular COVID-19 testing to $100 last week. This is a strong recognition of the vital role laboratories are playing to support the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we hope to see other payors follow CMS's lead.As we look to the next phase of managing the virus, we've begun to perform antibody testing, which could be useful in improving our understanding of infection rates in a certain area, as well as providing a likely indication of immunity for an individual.Antibody testing, also known as serology testing is a blood based test. We're moving from a testing pilot in which we initially supported a handful of hospitals and health systems to making the test available to all of our customers nationwide using a variety of test platforms.By mid-May, we anticipate having the capacity to perform over 200,000 antibody tests per day. I'm very proud of how our Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways. There are so many heroes at Quest from our scientific and medical staffs who have quickly brought up and validated new tests, through our operations teams, to our procurement teams, to our front line phlebotomists, couriers, pilots and specimen processors. And we've taken extra precautions to protect our employees with mandatory temperature checks at our labs and require use of protective equipment such as gloves, lab coats, masks, face shields, all this very depended on circumstances.Our employees take pride in their work because so many Americans depend on the insights of our testing delivers to make decisions to improve care. These efforts for all of us are inspiring. COVID-19 testing is critical to managing the pandemic. And while the volume of testing is substantial, it is that nearly enough to offset the reductions we're seeing in the rest of our business.During this difficult time, we're managing the business for the realities of today and to assure its long-term health. While we cannot say with precision. What the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have in our business, we do know it will have significant impact in our [technical difficulty]. We are taking actions to mitigate that impact.At the end of March, we withdrew our full-year 2020 outlook because we no longer had confidence in the outlook we provided in January. And we have taken a series of temporary actions to manage our workforce costs and conserve cash, to support the business and to navigate our way through the pandemic.This started with a 25% pay cut for me and reductions for salaried employees ranging from 20% for the most senior executives to 5% depending on level. Each of the members of our company's Board of Directors will forego 25% of their cash compensation. These pay reductions will be in place for 12 weeks.We've also suspended contributions to our 401(k) and deferred compensation plans through the remainder of the year. We've approved furloughs for more than 5,500 employees, or approximately 12% of our workforce whose work has diminished and also have indicated an interest to us. We've reduced hours for non-exempt employees where possible and as necessary. And then finally we’ve reduced overtime, frozen virtually all hiring and promotions; and dismissed temporary and contract workers.We're taking a balanced approach to implement these difficult measures. We also want to maintain flexibility because we know when the crisis ends, our volumes will begin to recover and we'll need our colleagues more than ever. This is a challenging time for all of us and in response to that we've established an employee relief fund for those colleagues who need assistance. Importantly, none of these changes will impact our ability to deliver critical COVID-19 testing.Now, I'd like to cover a few other topics. The passage of the CARES Act, the M&A environment and some early thoughts on how the lab industry may evolve in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act became law in late March, delivering much needed stimulus the country as we battle this crisis. The stimulus package included a number of benefits request and other health care providers.First, the Act provided coverage for critical COVID-19 testing at no out-of-pocket costs for nearly all patients. Second, regarding PAMA, the CARES Act suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021. In addition, the new round of data collection has been delayed another year into the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to use data from the first quarter of 2019. This is important as it allows ample time to implement the recommendations of the MedPAC study to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.Third, the Act appropriates $100 billion to health care providers for expenses or lost revenues that are attributed to COVID-19. Quest received approximately $65 million from the initial tranche of the $30 billion distributed to providers earlier this month. Finally, Medicare sequestration will be suspended from May to December this year. This 8-month sequestration holiday will afford us a small benefit.Now, turning to the M&A environment, we continue to make progress. We're pleased that we completed the Memorial Hermann transaction as well as its integration phase, and this is an important complex relationship with a very prominent healthcare system.There are other transactions in the pipeline that we were very close to announcing before the crisis. While they are on hold, our strong conviction is that these discussions will resume, which will be in the third quarter and will be a very good position at that point to complete those transactions.And then finally, I'd like to share some thoughts on industry dynamics, post crisis. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many to be open to discussions about Quest and how we can help them achieve their lab strategy. At the same time, we know that many smaller regional labs have had their own challenges. This could produce opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If any, the crisis could be an additional catalyst to drive the consolidation we've been forecasting for several years.Before I close, I just want to say once again how proud I’m to be part of the Quest team at this historic time. Our employees have stepped up in every way to serve the nation during this time of need. The challenges have brought all of us at Quest closer together, changing the way we work and collaborate, making us stronger as a team. We have become more agile, customer-focused and unified. We will emerge from this crisis stronger with substantial opportunities in front of us.Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results as well as our thoughts on our financial position. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.82 billion, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 3.8% compared to the prior year. As Steve noted earlier, our business performance was strong in January and February, but we experienced a substantial decline in volumes in March. Volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes declined 2.7%.Before describing some of the volume trends we saw in March and early April, I do want to spend a moment on the strong performance of our business prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, year-to-date total revenue growth was just over 4%, with organic revenue growth of just over 3.5%.Total volume growth was strong at 6.3%. Volume through February included a calendar benefit due in part to leap year, as well as mild winter weather. Adjusting for these benefits and the impact of acquisitions, organic volume growth in the first two months of 2020 was nearly 4.5%, indicating that the strong progress you made in 2019 continued into 2020.As we moved into March, we started to see single-digit volume declines through the first two weeks of the month. Stay-at-home measures were implemented in several states by the third week of March, volume declines accelerated to nearly 40%. And by the last week of the month, volume declines across the business started to approach 50%.So far in April, we have indications that volume declines have stabilized in the 50% to 60% range. These declines include the benefit of COVID-19 molecular testing, which has been running at approximately 30,000 tests per day on average or approximately 6% volume growth through April.Revenue per requisition declined 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were slightly more than 2% in the first quarter in line with our prior expectations. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 100 basis points.Reported operating income was $175 million or 9.6% of revenues compared to $248 million or 13.2% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $225 million or 12.3% of revenues compared to $286 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was entirely due to declining revenue in March as a result of COVID-19.Note that operating margin was up meaningfully year-over-year through February, primarily driven by the strong volume and revenue growth highlighted previously. Reported EPS was $0.73 in the quarter compared to a $1.20 a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 compared to $1.40 last year.Cash provided by operations was $247 million in the first quarter versus $275 million last year. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our financial position and our ability to access additional capital. As of March 31, we had $342 million of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity was available under existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of $529 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of March 31.In April, we borrowed $100 million under our secured receivables credit facility and $100 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our secured receivables facility is subject to certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility.Our unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants to limitations on indebtedness. In particular, the unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 3.5x EBITDA as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to comply with these covenants, beginning as early as the end of the second quarter. In this scenario, we would not be able to borrow against these credit facilities and then lenders would have the right to demand payment of any amount outstanding.We have been in advanced discussions with our lead lender regarding an amendment to certain financial covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this would provide us with the necessary flexibility to remain in compliance for the remainder of 2020.Based on these discussions and the strong support from our lead lender, we are confident we will be able to enter into this amendment later in the quarter. If, for some reason we are unable to enter into this amendment, we believe that our investment grade credit rating would provide us with access to alternate sources of financing. Finally, as noted in our earnings release this morning, we are also suspending share repurchases through the end of the year under our existing repurchase authorization.To summarize, we believe our financial position and ability to access additional capital is strong and our Board of Directors remain committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. As many of you know, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on March 31, given the unprecedented uncertainty caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to provide updated 2020 guidance at a more appropriate time when visibility improves around the impact of COVID-19 and the duration of current stay-at-home measures in place across the United States.While we aren’t providing guidance today, I'd like to share some details for you to consider as you build your models. As many of you know, our business is one of high fixed costs. We have modeled a number of different volume scenarios over the near to medium term and at this point our best estimate is that volumes for the business excluding COVID-19 testing will be down 50% to 60% in the second quarter.Once the COVID-19 crisis mitigates or passes and stay-at-home measures begin to lift, we believe our volume will slowly improve but to a lower level in 2020 than where we started the year. While we have taken several cost reduction steps, which we first shared in an 8-K on April 13, these steps are not sufficient to enable us to generate a profit at this volume assumption. If the conditions affecting lower lab utilization continue throughout the second quarter, it is highly likely we will incur a net loss.Molecular COVID-19 testing does serve as a partial offset to the volume declines we're experiencing across the rest of the business. We expect that demand for molecular COVID-19 testing will remain high throughout the second quarter and likely the foreseeable future. In addition to the uncertainty around health care utilization in lab volume trends, another unknown is the impact of serology testing. We believe there's significant potential in serology testing, but reimbursement and customer demand are still in front of us.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve?
Steve Rusckowski: To summarize, we were very pleased with January and February performance, but saw a material decline in last two weeks of March. We are managing the company for the long-term and are taking a series of actions to protect our financial flexibility.Quest has been at the tip of the spear in responding to the crisis, and we will continue to play a critical role in the next phase of containing COVID-19. While there's uncertainty in the near-term, we look forward to the gradual improving conditions we see in front of us. Eventually, the healthcare system will start to return to normal and when that happens, Quest will emerge from the crisis stronger with significant opportunities in front of us.Now, we'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. First, I want to commend you and all the Quest employees working through this crisis. It's been nice to see.
Steve Rusckowski: Appreciate that.
Ann Hynes: But my questions are focused on antibody testing.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure.
Ann Hynes: I know you said by mid-May your capacity will be about 200,000. What do you think your peak daily capacity could be over time? Because I'm assuming this is a serology test, it could be higher. And then secondly, what do you think the ultimate -- like how should we view this opportunity? Should we assume that everyone in the U.S. will at some point go a serology test, whether it's to get tested for the vaccine or go back-to-school or to go back to work? And maybe what is Quest doing to maybe grab some more of the market share? Are you working with governments, employees, school systems, things like that would be great. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. All right, Ann. All right. So all around antibody testing and serology testing. So as you read our press release yesterday, we launched our broad implementation of serology testing. We actually brought up a week or so ago, our first limited LDT laboratory developed tests on the EUROIMMUN platform. And we did that in two of our facilities and we did that for limited customers, hospitals and at risk individuals. So we had some experience with it.And then second, as we brought up our first platform, which is an app platform, and we announced last night, that will -- platform is in many of our sites and we will bring that up quickly. And then we will have a few other platforms we bring up in the course of April into May. And that will allow us to get to that 200,000 tests per day number by mid-May. We've run seven days a week, 24 hours a day. That's about 1.5 million per week. And so you can think about 6 million per month.Now, to answer your questions, we're not stopping there. We've got more capacity in front of us. We are always dependent though on the capacity coming out of the IVD manufacturers with the reagents that we need. So somewhat of the limiting factor has less to do with us where we have lab capacity, but more related to the reagents and the supply chain from our suppliers. So we're working with them as well. So that's what we're willing to say we'll have in the month of May.Now, how broad would this be? What we announced in a press release and you see the guidance from the FDA, while we do believe are several things, one is after a certain number of days and the best indication is after 14 days of being infected, the person can have an IGG response. That's the last antibody. And therefore, it is obviously a good measurement that you have been infected in the past. It's important to those individuals that have not been tested and made it -- might have been asymptomatic. So it's another good indication of infection rate within the geography or within a population. That's number one.Point number two is based upon other viruses. We believe that there may be immunity for some period of time. This is what we need to study. And that's why we have the conditions on our press release that we need to have more evidence and this is why we need to do more of it. The vast majority of viruses in the past have had immunity for a period of time, but we need to confirm this with evidence. So with that said, I would share with you we have tremendous interest in both continuation of the molecular testing that has to be done going forward. And then second is combining it with serology testing. This is happening at the state level for broad infrastructure needs.You might have seen a new announcement by the state of California. They're going to start to test asymptomatic members -- excuse me, citizens within California. Second is employers. We have actually leveraged our capability with our employer population health business, which we used to call our wellness business, where we have this product called Blueprint for Wellness and we work with employers. And we leverage that now in building on those relationships with employers in their return to work programs. And so that's giving us a nice leverage point. And the return to work programs vary by industry. It matters a great deal if you're a manufacturer and you have plants, or if you're an office environment or if you're a food processor, so we have a number of engagements going on with employers. And those employers are working with their states and are working with their cities and towns and local communities, as they think about what needs to happen and within those geographies, because there is wide variation, that's what's happening with the constraints around return to work and shelter-in-place in schools.And then finally, we are working with the states. Many of the states have mounted now task forces to look at what needs to happen next with test -- testing. As I said, California has made now a broader announcement of what they want to do to expand testing. We see this coming from out from a number of states. We're right in the middle of all those conversations. In fact yesterday, I did a press conference with the governor of Connecticut, Governor of Lamont in Connecticut, where we work proactively with one of our partners, Hartford HealthCare and expanding testing in the state of Connecticut.So as Mark said, there's substantial opportunities in front of us both for the molecular testing, which has to be done to rule in, rule out COVID-19. And then you, coupled with the opportunities we see for serology or antibody testing as well for overall surveillance within a population and returning to work. So a good opportunity in front of us.
Ann Hynes: All right. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you, Ann.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the detail. So you mentioned the minus 50% to minus 60% volume ex COVID, I guess first just want to clarify that the profit loss commentary is inclusive of COVID-19, so sort of it's an all-in number or is it enough to offset that profitability loss? And then how do you think about decremental margin with that type of revenue decline? If you can give us any sense there that would be helpful as well. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Mark.
Mark Guinan: Sure, Steve. So, Ralph, the statement around net loss would be a volume inclusive of COVID testing continue to be down around 50% to 60%. Now, what that does not include is serology. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the -- well, we're encouraged by the potential demand and a lot of the things that Steve just explained are either in mid-term or a late stage conversations around stepping up some testing for government entities, for employers, etcetera. We haven't been performing that test. Obviously, we just launched serology, so we wanted to be cautious about forecasting in any way how meaningful serology would be.But based on all the things we've talked about, it could be significant. We also don't know the reimbursement rate yet, but hopefully fairly soon. And I think the trigger for commercial rates will largely be based on where CMS comes out. So we're all waiting on that. So that net loss comment and the 50% to 60% would include the current level of PCR where we said we're averaging about 30,000 tests a day. It's offsetting about 6% of our loss, but it does not contemplate significant upside if it happens from serology testing at some point in this quarter. And then on a margin perspective, obviously, if we losing money, the answer to that, but from a drop through perspective, because we are high fixed costs and we've already counted on as much adjustment to our cost structure as we can optimize through our furloughs, through reduced hours to some of those salary reductions for the next twelve weeks. We're largely fixed cost after that.So therefore any sort of volume changes would likely be at a very high ratio, if things were to get worse. As we said, we believe we've bottomed out because we've seen some stability over the last couple of weeks. There's some encouraging signs in some of the areas that were most impacted because not all geographies are created equal. So, some of those are bouncing back a little bit. But at this point, we wanted to be cautious, we wanted to be conservative, we wanted to tell you what we know today. And therefore the outlook for the quarter is not based on speculation. That is based on what we're seeing and what we know today.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning. A lot to think about here. But one thing I guess we'd like to focus on a little bit is on the cost side, you Invigorate and the plans that you have had in place for a long, long time. How do we think about cost savings, net growth Invigorate, all of that kind of that we had originally built into the model. I'm guessing part of that …
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, yes.
Kevin Caliendo: … thrown out here.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, sure. So let me start, then Mark will I’m sure, add to it. First of all, Invigorate continues. That's a regular cadence and one of our two strategies that we have is to drive operational excellence and a portion of that is our efficiency program and we continue to look for that 3% of our cost basis for years. So that hasn't changed. So we continue to work on those programs. And in that regard, one of our flagship programs that we talk about is the new Clifton Laboratory that will allow us to consolidate the footprint to allow us to put in some new platforms, the immunoassay platform we talked about in the past, that project continues. But what I'll say, we're in the process of refreshing our plans because some of those plans might change. So, for instance, construction in the state of New Jersey might slip some. So some of those might change.And then secondly, some of the expectations around costs within a given year in terms of magnitude might be lower because some of it is volume dependent. However, in terms of percentage, if we're at lower volume levels, they'll be even higher percentages given some of this is fixed. So we're refreshing our perspective, but the goal of getting at least 3% of our cost basis for a year still stands. But we haven't provided an absolute number beyond the 3% in the past. So, Mark, would you like to add to it?
Mark Guinan: Yes, I think Steve summarized it well. A lot of our Invigorate is around volume related activities, whether it's labor, whether it's our lab throughput, whether it's the draws we're doing in a patient service centers. So any sort of savings, certainly will continue as we implement some of the cost improvement efficiency opportunities, but they will be proportional. So obviously the dollars will be less. We always talked about 3% on a $6 billion plus cost base. Obviously if the cost base goes down, given lower volumes, you can expect lower dollar savings. The other thing I would add is that a lot of our efficiency programs are, design along the normal level of testing. So it is difficult to operate as efficiently when you lose half your volume on a given line, some places even more than that and given assays.So the efficiency around reagents and other things operational, things like labor flexibility and so on. So there is some offset to our Invigorate program and lost efficiencies, while we continue at this low level of volume because we're not going to rescale our business obviously to that extent. We're considering this to be temporary at some point, even though I caution we don't expect to be fully back to the level we were prior to COVID. We at some point we'll be back to much more significant testing. I mean, some of our cancer screening is down, very, very significantly. We all know at some point we have to come back and do that work because cancer doesn't go away. So, Invigorate will continue. It will be proportional. There will be some offsets because of the inherent lower efficiencies at these volume levels.
Kevin Caliendo: If I can ask a quick follow-up on the volumes. When you say things have stabilized, are you seeing now a baseline where these are the chronic tests that basically need to be done and or are you starting to see an increase in sort of other testing that might -- you might be considered incremental that you hadn't seen in March that maybe you're now seeing again in April?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So volume has not turned around. We said it stabilize. So when you asked about whether things in March and now we're seeing them pick up, what I would say is that, we worked across what we call our clinical franchises, and there's absolutely differences depending on the acuteness of the condition and the necessity of the testing. But there's some very acute important areas of adjustments and like cancer screening led testing in children, etcetera, that are down significantly just because physician offices are closed and people are uncomfortable going out, or people being told not to go out except for extreme necessary situations. So while we absolutely see some levels of difference across the testing venue and how much it's down, some more than 50% to 60%, some less than that. I can't tell you that we've seen more discretionary type testing come back dramatically yet.
Kevin Caliendo: Guys, thanks so much for all your help on this.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Yes. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, we're doing well.
Jack Meehan: If you don't mind, I have a three parter on COVID testing. They're all …
Steve Rusckowski: Let me write it down, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Okay. The first one is where do you think reimbursement is going to shake out? Do you think commercial payers will follow the higher Medicare price? Second, how much further do you plan to scale up the testing? The stimulus package last night seem to call for further expansion. And then finally, just as you fold this all together with the core volumes down, if you look to the second half of the year, do you think net, net, it could be a positive impact as this testing persists? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So let me start. So on reimbursements, we were really encouraged by CMS upping the rate to $100. We're current -- currently working -- approaching all the commercial insurance companies on what their rate will be. And we don't have an answer on that, but we're encouraged that CMS went up and that's usually an indication that gives us leverage working with the commercial insurance companies. So more to come on that. Second, as Mark said, we still do not have the CMS rate for a serology testing. That's an important fact for us to establish reimbursement for serology, which would be, as we said, a significant opportunity. As far as scale, I mentioned in my comments, we are driving capacity gains going forward. We're bringing up some new platforms, trying to get some additional units. We're looking for different approaches of how we can get more productivity and more capacity from our existing platforms. And that is on the molecular side, will equally be on the serology side. And we have actually been asked by the White House task force to think creatively of what we can do to expand our capacity beyond what we have done so far. So we're thinking our way through that.As I said, we're right now at 50,000 tests per day, and that's for molecular. We're trying to get plans in place to bring us north of that number. But nothing that we can say at this point, but we're aggressively pursuing it. We are encouraged by what we saw last night come out of the Senate and hopefully the House will deliberate and we'll get the next round of funding. And some portion of that will come to us, because we do need to continue to do the testing in this country. And it so depended on both tests happening, molecular testing, as well as the serology tests going forward. So encouraged with the progress we're making, more in front of us. And yes, we will push hard to get more out.And as I said earlier, when I am asked the question about capacity on serology we have to look at the whole supply chain, the front end and the back end. So, yes, we have the lab capacity. But one of the issues we had on molecular side is not having the supplies, the swabs in the right places. We actually have shipped out in excess of a million swabs and we haven't resulted in excess of a million. So we have some inventory sitting out there. And also on the back end, it's very dependent upon IVD manufacturers providing us with the reagents and the kits o be able to increase our capacity as well. So we're working with them. And I can tell you, we're getting a lot of help from the task force, the White House, help from the states, everyone is rolled up their sleeves and trying to get more capacity out there. So there will be more coming, but what we’ve said so far is what we feel comfortable so far, I would say. Mark, you like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Let me add a couple of things. So, Jack, almost without exception and certainly all of the national payers and large regional payers, the commercial reimbursement for the PCR test was based on the rate for Medicare and was not a subset or proportion, which obviously it's in the industry practice, but was with at or above the CMS rate. So therefore, I'm confident that we're going to do well. As you know, CMS has updated this price. We are in advanced discussions and I think it's very probable that most, if not all the company, the commercial payers will recognize the higher rate from CMS and our commercial rates will change. So I'm optimistic there.In terms of the second half of the year, as we said, we're very careful. We -- none of us know how this is going to play out, but you can do the math. So if you know, the capacity for serology is in any way meet the demand and Steve talked about 200,000 a day, you have the PCR currently today at 50,000 tests a day combined, those represent almost half of our normal daily testing volume. And given that we don't know serology yet, but we're hopeful the price will be fairly close to an average requisition price for us.And we know that the PCR testing is above that with the CMS rate revision. One would assume that the value of a requisition will be somewhat similar to what our average is today. So, again, I don't know how much the core volume will recover, how quickly it will happen, etcetera. But if there is some recovery and if there is some high level of demand for the COVID-19 testing, as we're all hearing publicly, then you can do the numbers and you can see that the back half of the year could be very different than the second quarter.
Steve Rusckowski: And just to remind everyone there is a difference. And hopefully it's clear between the molecular testing, which requires a health care professional in most cases to do the specimen collection. And in many cases, they're protected with full garb of personal protection equipment. So that created a bottleneck of people getting tested. And we've worked on some different approaches to that. As a matter of fact, in the Walmart, the Walmart sites, we have observed self collection where actually we have an approved kit from the FDA where it is a nasal swab, but the person can use that swab themselves, but it has to be observed by health care professional.But in the case of Walmart, what actually happens is the person drives up, they provide the order to a health care worker in those parking lots that aren't nearly as protective as what we need to do before, they confirm all the information. The health care worker provides information that close up their window and they do the self collection themselves and it's observed through the window. So that's proven to be highly efficient. And we're looking at other ways of collecting that trend on the molecular side. So that has been a little bit of a bottleneck too on that and we're improving how we get the specimens.Remember, serology is blood based. And so it leverages all our infrastructure. And so as you know we have 12,000 phlebotomists, we have 2,200 patient service centers, we have 4,000 phlebotomists and physicians' offices. And so when this starts to light up, that provides us a nice opportunity to collect those specimens quickly and potentially tag those orders onto other orders that might be coming in from the health care delivery system as health care starts to turn on. So when you think about serology and you think about the front end being much simpler and much more pervasive and leveraging everything already have, not exceptional like the molecular test has been so far.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Good morning. And thank you very much for the update that you've been providing over the last four weeks. Very, very helpful and all the transparency. My question is focused on unemployment. Obviously, it's another variable to think about as we think about this year and next. So first, how are you incorporating into your assumptions that Mark talked about. And then if we think historically you have relatively more exposure to Medicaid. Just wanted to better understand, is there something that's structural or will you -- do you expect that we are going to see higher -- as we're seeing higher unemployment to see a move from commercial to Medicaid? And then maybe if you can give us some sense of what's the relative pricing or relative margin so we can we can start framing what that mix shift could mean for second half of the year in 2021? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start with that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, our Medicaid revenues, as you know, are low single digits. Currently Medicaid is typically lower priced than Medicare, typically priced lower than commercial rates. Now when you talk about unemployment, absolutely, we've thought about that. And one of the reasons amongst many that we're cautious about whether volumes bounce back to where they were earlier in the year was the potential for continued unemployment higher than obviously we've had in the number of years. And so, therefore we are recognizing that potential as we think about the balance of the year. And quite frankly, going forward, the other dynamic is if you look historically and obviously we try to do that, I'm sure others have to try to predict what might happen this time, there are some notable differences. One of them is the Affordable Care Act does provide more of a safety net for those who lose their jobs. So that's a positive.But the other thing is, given the magnitude and the speed at which people have become unemployed, it's really difficult to model and predict what that might do to utilization. We are being very cognizant of collectability, not just from patients, but from hospital systems, from physicians. So we're monitoring very, very closely our receivables and collection rates. And we are anticipating likely headwinds on collectability of our revenue going forward, given everything that's going on. So that's certainly on our radar. But the other dynamic is, given that utilization has -- in the last couple of months dropped significantly, one might assume that a greater portion of our revenues would be coming from patients because people will be more slowly or not getting through their deductible and calendar basis relative to where they may have in the past.So we've looked at all of these things and that obviously it will be a headwind. But there's no model we can point to historically to say this is exactly what it means. I mean, in the last significant recession, our collectability rate actually did not materially decline. Utilization was impacted, but we did not have a higher rate of what used to be bad debt. Now it's mostly patient concessions. But given all the dynamics this time, we think that that's a likely possibility. However, you do have the safety net through the Affordable Care Act of expansion of Medicaid in many states. So how all those pieces put together? I can't fully predict, but trust me we're thinking about all that. And as we see trends and as we understand those impacts, as always, we'll be extremely transparent around what we're seeing.
Ricky Goldwasser: Understood. Thank you. And just one follow-up question on the volume side. Whether you -- do you see any differences in geographies? Obviously, you have the national footprint and when we think about different states we're trying to kind of look at the volume declines to try to start to think about how recovery might look like. So are you seeing any differences between volumes in the northeast versus the south versus the west?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So we've built up a model looking at our business from multiple perspectives. One, Mark, said earlier we have variation by types of clinical franchise business we have, some have declined greater, some have declined less. And we're thinking about why that has happened and when there is turning back on to health care delivery system, how quickly they will come back up. So that's one. Second is we do have differences between what's happened in the hospital environment and also physician environment. And so as hospitals start to change what they are going to allow back in their doors, that will change. That is well. And then third, we do see a difference in what's happening by state and by cities. And so we've tracked all of that. And what we have found, as we said in my introductory comments, all metropolitan areas have dropped. Obviously, some of those areas like New York, New Jersey, and now Lawson is starting to light up, parts of Florida have come in later than the West Coast. So we're tracking all of that and we're doing that because we're also trying to see when things might start to turn back on.So you start to see some of the individual states starting to loosen up their shelter-in-place and started to loosen up employers coming back to work. And so we're watching that carefully, so we can kind of indicate where we need to bring back our capacity. We talked about our costs programs. We've talked about furloughs. I want to make sure it's clear. Our furlough program was a program where we offered it to employees, but they had requested from us and we had to grant it. And so we grant out furlough. It allows them to continue to benefits request, but also allows them to collect unemployment and apply to the CARES Act for a weekly stipend. But it also allows us to bring them back. And so they have an obligation to come back when we need them. So as these states start to turn back on, we will bring back the capacity we need to turn it back on. But we're watching that Ricky carefully to understand what's gone down and when did we start to see some recovery by state and by clinical franchise going forward.
Mark Guinan: Yes, the one other thing I'd add is that while shelter-in-place certainly has a significant impact on utilization and some of the greatest volume decreases were in those geographies, as we mentioned, every major metropolitan area in the country was seeing significant declines. Maybe not to the same extent in late March and then into early April, regardless of whether we had shelter-in-place. We are not as true outside the urban areas, but in the metropolitan areas people were being cautious, including physician offices, etcetera in -- how they were accepting patients and whether they were staying open or not and patients were being cautious about whether going out or not, given all the media attention and so on and so forth. So while there is absolutely a correlation with shelter-in-place rules, it's more than that, that has been depressing utilization.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Folks, there's a number of people still in the queue. And we're getting towards the bottom of the hour and we'd like to get to most of you, so please limit to one question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Steve.
Stephen Baxter: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, thanks for all the information and thanks for everything you guys are doing a standup testing capacity.
Steve Rusckowski: Appreciate it.
Stephen Baxter: I appreciate all the color on the antibody testing so far. So I'm just wondering, I guess, how you guys are thinking about sizing the demand when you scale up capacity to those levels? Because if you could run 6 million tests a month, you could test more than 20% of the country yourself over the next year. And obviously others will be ramping up their antibody testing capacity as well. So it sounds like you think this is going to go well above the sort of like sampling types of analysis that we've seen in places like Germany and New York City starting to pursue. I was hoping you could help us see the bigger picture here, from where you think this might be going over time. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, well, to start with, if you look at the numbers that come out of the White House in their press briefings, we said that we've done over a million tests. We're close to 25% of the total country's testing. Obviously, we have better percentages, a higher percentage in certain states grew up broader presence. And some states are really just ramping up their testing in a bigger way. If they look at Florida, where we have a big presence that's just really started to light up in a big way. As far as the opportunity in front of us, we are encouraged by the opportunity we see. We're waiting to see how quickly it does ramp up and just what kind of pickup there will be from physicians on serological testing and how fast that ramp will be. But we're building enough capacity to respond to it. And again, a lot of our capacity will be highly depended upon the equipment we have and the reagents we get. So if there's more, we're hopeful we can build on what we have, but we are very limited by that. So we're going to keep our eye on it, push it as one of the two testing categories that should be done to respond to the virus and see how quickly it ran. So we will keep you updated as we learn more.
Stephen Baxter: Is there something that's going to be an add on to your typical kind of routine panels, or do you anticipate people coming in sort of exclusively for these types of test? That’s it for me. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: I would say both. And I think there's as I mentioned earlier, we're working with employers because many employers are trying to understand how they bring back to employees. And there's wide variation in employers, but these employee programs will both test your employees for the virus with the molecular tests, and they'll also test them for the antibody tests. And we might do those, particularly the antibody test in different types of venues like corporate sponsored events where we can -- now where we can draw the specimen quickly as we do, corporate events they were for flu shots or Blueprint for Wellness program. So we already have that capability of ramping up these corporate programs. And those will be quite different than the traditional way of doing testing that we have with physicians or hospitals today.
Stephen Baxter: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Derik.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ivy for Derik today. Thank you for taking the question and thank you for comments so far and all the COVID updates in the past few weeks. It's very helpful. So I wanted to talk about longer term here and looking across COVID. So the two parter. One, does COVID change your thought on future wellness and routing testing demand? And two, does COVID and the PAMA delays change your view on lab consolidation. So with this change there could be more difficult to have those conversations with hospital C levels? Just wanted to get your thought on that here?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you start the first one, I had a hard time hearing the first question. Mark, did you pick it up?
Mark Guinan: Go ahead. If you wouldn’t mind repeating, you talked about future wellness.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. So that's the COVID-19 changed your thought on future wellness and routine testing demand. So in other words, does the crisis drive more routine and one is testing, given that people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk from that virus or there may be more of a downside from the post COVID disruptions.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So on that one, it's very hard to predict. And just like you're asking, it could go either direction. We don't have any sort of crystal ball better than anybody else. Obviously, in my prepared remarks and then one of my answers, I expressed a concern that we're deferring critical diagnostic testing that's important for our health and well-being. And one would hope that at some point we say, that's really important, we've got to find a way to get it done regardless of what risks might be around COVID and whether that bounces back to where it was before or whether to your point could it potentially be more because COVID is obviously much riskier for those with pre-existing conditions that we're all familiar with and that means we want even more tightly manage that. I certainly can't predict it. I’m not sure, if Steve wants to comment anything differently. So that's unclear. But as we said, as we progressed through this and we all learned together, we will be highly transparent around what we're seeing so that you all can understand as much as possible how that is playing out. Then, Steve, the other one was on PAMA lab consolidation.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. We see an opportunity. So if you think about what's happening within the healthcare provider market, we're an indication that volumes are down. You have all the data on possible missions. You have data on physician visits. You see it reflected in our volumes being down. And so hospitals and as we all know, 50% of physicians now are employed by hospital systems are going to be struggling as they enter this quarter. And we'll be looking at opportunities to become more efficient, reduce their cost, generate some cash. And so we believe there could be an opportunity for us to continue our consolidation strategy in the back half the year, it is more of these systems and some of those dialogues we've had for years maybe become more active now because there's now more likely to think about creative ways that they can work with a company like Quest on their lab strategy.So we think that could be another catalysts for consolidation. And as you know, this is also a fragmented industry. There's other regional, especially laboratories. And it also might have worsened other opportunities for us to consolidate. So we believe this is a good opportunity in the long-term for us to continue our strategy of accelerating our growth and consolidating the marketplace. And in the short-term, it's difficult, but in the mid to long-term, we think it could be yet another opportunity to do what we’ve said we wanted to do.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Matt.
Matt Larew: Thanks. Hey, how are we doing? Thanks for fitting me and I wanted to ask about this sort of pacing through the recovery second quarter and third quarters here. A number of states have targeted opening up at the beginning of May and then some in the second week of May. A component of that and the administrations kind of guidelines are focused on getting some of the non-emergent care back opened up and physician offices opened up. But Mark, I think you mentioned that you anticipate non-COVID testing down 50% to 60% for the quarter. Could you maybe just give a sense for how in terms you're thinking about what those months might look like as states start to open up in some of that care, which as you’ve alluded to, isn't necessarily entirely not elective starts to return.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So as I said, we are not going to speculate, because it shows too hard to predict. So, yes, there's absolutely some potential for volume bouncing back from where it is now. We're not assuming any material improvement for the quarter, not because we know that won't happen, but because we think that's the appropriate point of view to take in order to make sure people are aware of some of the potential downside. We also haven't built in any significant serology volumes into those assumptions. And we've heard a lot of discussion today around that potential demand and ramping up fairly quickly. We don't know to what extent. So I don't want anyone to assume we have too much precision around this 50% to 60% down for the quarter and a, net operating loss. But that's potential if it does stay where it is and we don't get significant serology testing or significant upwards in our PCR testing. I don't know if you want to add anything, Steve, to that.
Steve Rusckowski: I think I'll add is what I just said earlier. There is going to be a lot of pent up demand from patients. And Mark said there's been a lot of physician offices that have been canceled, postponed and delayed. And so they will start to come back to the system. When that will be, we will vary by city and by state. And so that's what I said earlier in the comments we're tracking all that. So one could think later in the quarter you start to see some recovery. There'll also be those physicians' offices in those hospital systems want to bring back in those patients as well. So we're actually going to do a survey of our customers to get a perspective of what they're thinking about when they turn back on their offices or open up their offices with extended hours, extended workdays. I think people are now thinking that the summer won't be the same summer. July and August won't be the heavy vacation period. So we're watching all that. But as Mark said, too early and too much too much uncertainty around it for us to give you anything more than we provided. But we're keeping an eye, our eyes on it closely.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Don.
Donald Hooker: Great. Great. Good morning. So in last quarter, you called out some significant expenses around your advanced diagnostics. And I think a part of that was associated with the very interesting acquisition. I think a Blueprint that was kind of thinking about that being a nice tailwind for 2021. It sounds a little discretionary to me. Is that's something you're going to continue to pursue and as we think going forward.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, absolutely. Our strategy to accelerate growth continues. One of those strategies is to continue to build our advanced diagnostics platform. Again, that's all genetics and molecular. The acquisition that we did complete early this year was a nice platform capability acquisition. We feel good about that company coming into Quest Diagnostics. The integration is going well. There's a lot of opportunities in front of us with a genetic base testing. And our plans for that do not change given the crisis step that we have.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Lisa.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Lisa Gill: Good morning, everyone. Steve, in your prepared comments you talked about changes to the lab industry. And I'm just curious around your thoughts on telemedicine and the impact going forward. So clearly, at some point we're going to start to see physician offices open again, etcetera. But I think every large hospital system, to your point that own physicians has talked about the fact that we'll see more telemedicine going forward. How do you think about your relationship? Do you have any preferred relationships today with Telehealth providers that you anticipate that you'll see more Telehealth services in the home and then they'll be coming to your patient services center? I'm just curious, as to how you think that trend plays into Quest going forward?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, we’ve been working with all the Telehealth providers and platforms in this many different models as we know. So we do see that as another channel, if you will, or another type of capability as health care provision. And this crisis has burned some of those models there and established some credibility and some comfort with patients. And so we do believe that will become a larger percentage of our volume. And when you have those engagements, many of you on the call probably have had those engagements, they do order testing. And then it follows the workflow that we have for testing within Quest Diagnostics. And then depending upon the model we’ve used in the platforms, the use is telemedicine going to be your primary care physician or would they be an adjunct to it and therefore, we have the connectivity to connect back to the EMR in the primary care physician. So good opportunity. We have strong relationships with many of the Telehealth platforms, big and small. We actually are always prospecting what new startups and ventures are coming up with new capabilities. There's been a lot of new front end capabilities, triage capabilities that you see to run COVID-19, which has been interesting, some of which we're very well of -- we're aware of and have good relations with. So it is changing and this crisis has brought more visibility to it. So we believe that's a good opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with those companies going forward.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Erin.
Erin Wright: Hi. Good morning. Hope everyone is well. In terms of PAMA, do you think that you've also earned some goodwill in light of the COVID response that can help with the lobbying efforts overall and for the recalculation of rates there? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. What I'll say, Erin, is it can't hurt. This crisis has brought to the forefront the importance of testing. And I never believed when I joined this company over eight years ago, that would be on the front page of every news story in America and all over the media, but we are. So it's much easier now for us to make our case with members of Congress, to the administration in HSS with the value of testing and the need for us to get fairly reimbursed. And also to reinforce the intent of Congress in making sure we get a new process put in place that properly reflects the market rates. So it is actually a very good fact for us. We're going to leverage that. Just to remind everyone the CARES Act did change the timing. I had those in my prepared remarks. And then second is we still have the lawsuit going on, which is still happening. And we're hopeful we'll get a decision sometime this year on that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Eric.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks -- hey, thank you very much. You mentioned in prepared remarks the $65 million distribution from the first $30 billion out of the CARES Act. Just a couple of questions on that. Does that mean you're anticipating getting another $150 million plus here in the short-term? $65 million at 30%, so assume it's $150 million less. And secondarily, with the 25 billion of testing stimulus that just came out, are there any impacts to Quest other than just the support of more volume and more activity in the market? Are there any direct impacts from that new 25 billion for testing that just came through in stimulus?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Mark, do you want to start on the $65 million?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So that was a unique situation. They created a pot of money of $30 billion emergency relief. There were no stipulations for how you would get that money. In fact, we are surprised, it showed up in our bank account. It was based on proportional billings to Medicare and that probably divided up at $30 billion. So anyone who had billed Medicare in the prior year got a portion of that. The other parts of this bill are, for various aspects of getting testing up and running. I will turn to Steve to cover some of that, but there's nothing else that quite mirrors that emergency relief fund where we got the $65 billion. So while there's opportunities for us to utilize some of the other funds, it's not as straightforward and it's not as simple as what happened with that emergency relief fund. So, Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. And I'll just say the package that was just approved by the Senate last night, we don't have a lot of clarity of any specificity underneath the hood, if you will. And then also, as you know, it's going to be debated in the House. So we'll be watching and giving them input as they refine it. But it is critical to get America turn back on, that we have the resources and we're properly reimbursed and paid for the work we do. And as I said, we are the leader for a portion -- a large portion of the country is testing. And therefore, I would expect that some portion of that money we could tap into as a resource for us, but it's uncertain at this time what it will be and if any.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, last question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Brian.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: Good morning, guys, and thanks again for everything. So just for the last question, just really quickly. So, Steve, thanks for all the updates or comments on your -- the hospitals and physicians. But as we think about your referral sources and try to pinpoint the recovery, if you don't mind could you give me some more granularity on where the bulk of your referrals are coming from? Is it primary care specialist and then hospitals? And then I guess my follow-up is just what your average serology test reimbursement is across the platform? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So just to give you a scale again of what our different businesses. Of our business, roughly a billion of it before crisis was coming from hospitals. To give you an idea of the scale and -- and then a billion of our business is -- are related services like our population health business with employers, our employer drug testing business, our insurance business. And so the remainder is really physician driven, okay? So, roughly $6 billion of our $8 billion before crisis was -- is physician driven. So those referrals are obviously very important because that's where we get the vast majority of our volume.
Mark Guinan: And then on serology testing, Brian, well, we've never shared a dollar amount. You can look at some of the CMS rates. We've made it clear through our trade association that we don't think the crosswalk that they probably would default to is sufficient. Obviously you saw -- in the first case for the PCR, we weren't successful initially. They established a rate and then they reconsidered, looked at it and almost doubled it. So we're hopeful that in the case of serology, there's some pretty compelling evidence and detail that we're going to get a serology rate for the COVID testing that's more commensurate with the cost that its -- we're going to incur in order to perform it.
Shawn Bevec: Steve, closing remarks.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. Well, thanks everyone, for joining us today. Glad we got everyone's questions and we appreciate your continued support and you have a great day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any distribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning I'll discuss the fourth quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results, then take you through our 2020 guidance. But we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. Strong volume growth from expanded health than planned network access, combined with outstanding execution of our operational excellence strategy helped us offset significant reimbursement pressure.For the fourth quarter, we grew revenues 4.8%, reported EPS was $1.86 and adjusted EPS was $1.67, up nearly 24% from the same period in 2018. Volume growth remained strong at 4.1%. For the full year of 2019, revenues grew 2.6%, reported EPS grew 16% to $6.13 and adjusted EPS grew 4% to $6.56 and volume grew 4.3%. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 6%. And this is the ninth increase since 2011.Before getting into the more details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to discuss how Quest is squarely within healthcare's AAA, as well as covered on PAMA and the recent passage of the LAB Act. So many providers within healthcare are focusing on healthcare's AAA, which is all about improving medical quality and the patient experience, while reducing the cost of care.Quest is dedicated to provide a great medical and service quality. One example is that we drive six input quality in our logistics performance by tracking specimen pickups. We're proud that our quality enables us to become a member of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network.Second, over the past several years we've made great strides on improving the patient experience. Investments in digital platforms and our patient service centers, as well as our partnerships with retailers such as Safeway and Walmart are helping to drive patient satisfaction scores above 90%. Also our Net Promoter Score exceeds 80%, which is very high particularly in health care services.Finally, Quest offers the best value in the lab industry. Test prices for many of our smaller boutiques and hospital competitors can be two to five times higher than our prices and sometimes even more. So taken together, our medical quality, patient experience and competitive pricing delivers a value proposition that is second to none in our industry.I'd like to update you on three fundamental changes to the marketplace, which I believe favor Quest. First, PAMA. This is the largest hub in Medicare reimbursement this industry has ever seen.Second, receive health plans focusing on the wide variation in price for health care delivery. And they are looking at opportunities to work with fewer higher value providers. Our expanded network access with UnitedHealthcare and the implementation of the preferred lab network are perfect examples of this.And then third is the increasing consumerization of health care. Consumers are shouldering more and more of the cost of health care and they're looking for the best value. We believe Quest Diagnostics is the best deal in town.I'd like to quickly comment on PAMA and the latest development regarding the passage of the LAB Act. We were pleased to see the LAB Act become law in late December. And it is the first step in fixing CMS's deeply through data collection process. The Lab Act will delay the data reporting period for one-year to the first quarter of 2021. It will also require MedPAC to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.As many of you know the one-year delay now means that CMS will delay on the existing fee schedule for the basis of cuts in 2021. Despite the increase in reimbursement reduction caps from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021, we expect the PAMA headwinds in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2019 and 2020.Additionally ACLA, our trade associations continues its legal challenge against HHS. Both sides have submitted their briefs to the courts and the matters in the hands of the judge. We expect a decision sometime this year.Now, turning to our recent performance and progress. The first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements; grow more than 2% per year through accretive strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We're recognizes as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services. And then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Boston Clinical Laboratories, a small regional laboratory in Massachusetts.We also recently announced two new acquisitions. The first, Blueprint Genetics. It strengthens our leadership position in advanced diagnostics, through proprietary bioinformatics, which is often a bottleneck in next-generation sequencing. Blueprint's proven platform and specialty genetics, especially, variant interpretation and reporting is expected to significantly speed the average rate at time of interpretation.We also announced a multifaceted long-term collaboration with the Memorial Hermann Health System, one of the largest not-for-profit health systems in Southeast Texas. As part of the agreement, Quest will acquire Memorial Hermann's outreach lab services business and manage all 17 of its inpatient hospital labs in Greater Houston under our professional lab services agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.And then finally, we recently signed a professional laboratory services agreement with an eight hospital health system in Tennessee. We continue to see accelerating revenue and volume growth as a result of our branded health plan network access.The sequential acceleration in volumes demonstrates our ability to drive continued market share growth. We look forward to the further rollout of United's Preferred Lab Network, featuring $0 out-of-pocket cost for members. The test growth drivers in the quarter and full year include drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing of both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, hemepath, our blood cancer test and Cardio IQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth.Overall, our G-based and esoteric testing grew approximately 5% for the year, an acceleration from low single-digit growth a year ago. And then, our second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We delivered on our 2019 goal to reduce our cost base by 3% by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, while enhancing the customer experience.So here's three examples. First, our immunoassay platform consolidation is expected to provide brief throughput, autonomy and more efficient footprint, while saving us approximately $35 million annually when fully implemented. Second, we are optimizing our lab network through investments in our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. When operationally active in 2021, our new lab is expected to consolidate three regional hub labs, double our average throughput and provide 30% more capacity.And then third, we're using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. Nearly nine million patients have downloaded the MyQuest digital platform, which enables them to make appointments and receive their results.Now let me turn it over to Mark to go through the results. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.93 billion, up 4.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 5.1%, compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth an easy compare and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 4.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.4%. Importantly, we continue to see a sequential acceleration in organic volume growth in the fourth quarter after considering the benefit of the extra revenue day in the third quarter.Revenue per requisition increased 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by an easy compare, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of nearly 120 basis points.As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical lab fee schedule, as well as modest indirect price changes primarily from Medicaid. Reported operating income was $363 million or 18.8% of revenues, compared to $220 million or 12% of revenues last year.On an adjusted basis, operating income was $329 million or 17% of revenues, compared to $295 million or 16% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.Additionally, patient concessions were down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.86 in the quarter, compared to $0.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.67, up approximately 24% from $1.36 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.24 billion in 2019 versus $1.2 billion last year and capital expenditures were $400 million in 2019, compared to $383 million a year ago.Now turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2020 is as follows; revenue is expected to be between $7.8 billion and $7.96 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.51 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.6; cash provided by operations is expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and $400 million.There are several considerations that I will review as you think about 2020 and beyond. First, we will continue to face significant reimbursement pressure this year in large part due to the ongoing headwinds from PAMA. Total reimbursement pressure in 2020 is expected to be slightly more than 200 basis points, of which PAMA and associated impacts are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. We estimate a similar impact from PAMA in 2021.Second, it's no secret that the tightening labor market has resulted in rising wage pressure. To remain competitive, we are investing in employee pay and benefits. The incremental cost is included in our guidance. Third, despite the continued reimbursement headwinds, we are making disciplined strategic investments in our advanced diagnostics capabilities that we expect will be slightly dilutive to our earnings in 2020 by roughly $0.15. A portion is related to our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics. The remainder is related to investments in liquid biopsy and next-generation sequencing automation.Fourth, our revenue guidance contemplates some M&A carryover, plus the two deals we recently announced. And finally, our revenue guidance includes contributions from the PLS relationships that Steve mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that revenue and volume contributions from PLS typically take a couple of quarters for rent.I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Well, thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash. Quest is well positioned in 2020 to grow revenues and earnings despite another year of meaningful reimbursement pressure. And then, finally, our guidance for 2020 is realistic and achievable.Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Shawn Bevec: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open up for questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. M&A, obviously, is an important component of your guidance. And when we think about the transactions that you announced recently. It seems the pace has slowed down in the last 12 months. What are you seeing in the environment that you think is driving the relative slowdown? Is it that you're seeing less in the pipeline? Or are the labs waiting to see what PAMA results is? Or is it more on your end?And then, one follow-up to that is, just, given the headwinds that you're going to see this year around reimbursement wage pressure in the additional investments, should we still assume that the cost cutting the integrate program would drive a net benefit to the top line – to the bottom line.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So thanks, Ricky, for the question. So to remind everyone, we have a long-term goal of having 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions as part of our five strategies to accelerate growth. What we have shared is that we made good progress against that over the last several years. And because of the three elements that we see at play in our marketplace, we do believe that it affords us an opportunity to consolidate the market.So last fall, we did increase our expectation and our goal to get to about 2% through acquisitions. And if you look at 2018, we beat that number. If you look at what we just reported for 2019, we're a little light. But if you look at 2018, 2019, we're about that 2% level. And that 2% is a CAGR, because as you know all acquisitions are somewhat lumpy. We're going to have some stronger quarters. We're going to have some weaker quarters in terms of acquisition growth, but we're shooting for that 2%. So what we just announced in the last several weeks we think are good indications that we continue to work on our pipeline. We play -- Blueprint Genetics is a good opportunity to invest in advanced diagnostics that will provide some growth and some capabilities to organizations that we think are helpful to accelerate growth.And then second is what we also announced around Memorial Hermann is a great example of what we have done in the past and we'll continue to do more of. And we're actively engaged with many other integrated delivery systems around that concept. And to remind you it's comprehensive where we're helping them with their hospital laboratory, making them more efficient. In that regard we're helping them with their reference testing for the hospital. And then finally in the Memorial Hermann case we bought their outreach business.And so what we have shared in the past our funnel is strong. But these deals become more complicated. They're big systems. They have many hospitals as many stakeholders. So this is just taking more time. So funnel is good. And we just announced two deals. And so we think we're starting 2020 with a good pop of acquisitions and we're also hopeful there will be more to come throughout the year. So Mark?
Mark Guinan: And on your integrate question, Ricky. Thank you. When you think about the pieces that are headwinds and tailwinds, you mentioned the headwinds certainly we've got the pricing pressure we talked about 200 basis points, we've got our typical way to inflation on about $3 billion wage bill and then we said there's incremental pressure on that. And then you've got the investments.So the 3% productivity, we drive in order of magnitude through our invigorate program alone would not be enough to offset all of that and drive bottom line growth. But importantly the other tailwind is organic volume growth and the contribution of other acquisitions between -- besides Blueprint. And so that's really -- it's all fungible. But that's how we're able to grow our bottom line.So invigorate alone about 3% productivity, it take 2% price, it take a couple hundred basis points against our wage bill of $3 billion, it take the advanced diagnostic investments. They're larger than just invigorate. So it's really the organic growth of our business and the contribution of the profitable outreach acquisitions that really help us to grow the bottom line.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Kevin.
Adam Noble: This is actually Adam Noble in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I know it's still pretty early in the year, but could you talk to what type of share gains, volume growth you're seeing from United and some of the other 2019 new access plans year-over-year so far in January? And are you still seeing them outcome the rest of your book? And if yes, do you have any visibility where those share gains are still coming?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, let me provide a little bit of color then Mark will add to it. So what we shared throughout 2019. Given our volume growth and what we just reported the volume growth we're picking up share. And, yes, we're picking up share from United as we had expected. And then second we'll we pick up share for United, we believe we're actually picking up share from other payers and other portions of the business.We also have managed our Aetna relationship quite well. It continues to be a strong partner of ours with them letting back into the network of one of our competitors -- as well. So we feel good about the progress made in 2019. And what I say it was implied in our guidance for 2020 is a continuation of that market share gain program and our acceleration of growth strategy. As we said back in Investor Day 2018, we believe that the new access changes that we now have afford us about $1 billion worth of opportunity.We have a good start on that in 2019. And clearly we have more opportunity in 2020 and beyond. Incumbent at all that assumes that we're going to pick up share. And as I said, there's a lot of aspects of that and we're just getting started with – for a lab network for United. And so therefore finding our guidance is picking up share again and some of that will come from the United. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So when you look at our performance last year, we would say that the typical non-network access piece was probably similar to our historic and historically over the last couple of years or get roughly 50 to 100 basis points of growth. And so the growth beyond that you can pretty much attribute to network access.And I want to remind is that it's not just United we also got into Horizon Blue Cross in New Jersey. We got into a portion of Anthem in Georgia. And as Steve mentioned, while the United and the other two plans access increased helped those, specifically it also helped us grow and other payers as well.So we are definitely growing share and that share is coming from multiple competitors not just our chief competitor. The other thing I'd say, you asked about January, well we're not going to comment on January, specifically obviously. we're almost 112 of the way through 2020. And if we were in any way concerned about that progress we certainly would have built that into our guidance. So we're considering January performance thus far as we communicate guidance today.
Adam Noble: Got you. And if I could just sneak in one more. Is there anything you could share at this point with regards to the assay vendor consolidation any timing of that? And it would just be super helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. We actually did a very thorough job of evaluating all the different alternatives. We have selected a vendor for that. And we've started the deployment of the systems that we have to deploy to allow us to achieve that eventual $35 million in savings. And so we've started to deploy those as some of our larger facilities.
Adam Noble: Got you. Thanks for the questions.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Hi, thanks very much.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Lisa, good morning.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. I just wanted to follow back up on the comments around continued reimbursement headwinds. I know when I saw you a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, you did talk about pressure on the commercial market as we think about that? And Mark, I think you talked about continued reimbursement headwind when being roughly $0.15. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around where you're seeing that from a commercial market perspective? And then I just wanted also just an update on how you're thinking about your retail strategy?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark do you...
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Lisa, I don't recall $0.15. I don't think that's something that would represent the reimbursement pressure. So when you're looking at non-PAMA related headwinds. As we've shared over the last 18 months or so, a lot of that is not coming from third-party, the traditional payer reimbursement but it's increasingly coming from the portion of our business that is direct to client bill. And the largest piece of that is hospitals, it's the high end testing we do what we typically refer to as reference work. And we've described how when you think of the set of criteria that a hospital like basis decision in terms of relationship, test, menu, quality, history and price there's been more of a shift to price over the last several years. And we're speculating a lot of that is driven by some of the pressure they're under.So, whereas, in the past you might extend the contract with the understanding that you had a good reasonable price and they had good quality and all those kind of things. More and more of these are going to RFP where there's an opportunity for price competitors to come in and compete on price very highly. So that's one of the dynamics that have definitely increased is the hospital-based client build.The other one we've talked about is in several states where there are no any markup laws. Physicians can actually send work to us. And build a third-party themselves. And you basically mark up the work that we do. And that is a direct build this an office that we compete. And you can imagine that if there's profit mode for those customers. Any nickel they can say from any lab is something that's attractive to them.So that is definitely a source of a lot of our pricing headwinds. And then there is a small piece in third-party payer as well as some older contracts are getting renegotiated and getting more in line with the current pricing environment.
Lisa Gill: That’s helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, on the retail strategy, it goes back to as I outlined our five strategies to accelerate growth. And it's all part of our consumer strategy and the consumer strategy is those multiple strategies. And one piece of it is, we want to have better physical presence. And so we've been working on getting better physical presence for a number of years.To remind everyone we have about 2,100 patient service centers. We have over 4,000 lobotomists and physicians' offices, so in excess of 6,000 access clients. And with those patient service centers what we started on this strategy, we had about 20% and we're retail like settings, more strip walls convenient locations, not in medical office parts. And our goal is to get to 50%. So we want to have 50% of our centers in more retail like settings. And so to help us with that, we actually have formed some partnerships with Safeway, relationship has gone well. We're in about 150 stores. We then added to that our joint venture with Walmart. We continue to make progress there with their patient service centers. You also might see that Walmart is making some other loans in health care. We're engaged with them on that.And then finally as we continue to talk to you and have relationships with other retail like partners in health care as they continue to advance their strategies as well. So you're building at 20%. We're about 30% now with retail like settings. We've got more work to do to get the 50% but that's our goal.We believe it's important that we have more retail like settings, because as I said in my introductory remarks, this market is getting more and more consumer oriented every day. We believe that the consumer will look at the value proposition we'll look at the triple aim. So I remind you it's great health care, it's great experience at great pricing, and we think our strategy delivering really points us to the right direction.The physical presence and the convenience of walking into a Quest diagnostic facility, we think, is part of that. So progress made, but more work to do and we're really fortunate to have some of the partners we have and we think we're on the path of getting to that 50%.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ivy [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for taking my question.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi. Good morning.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. I appreciate the color on the guide so far. While you talk about the incremental headwinds on the weight fill from the labor cost, can you help us size the pressure on margin from that labor cost? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. To give a little bit of color, operational mark, we view some of the -- than what's implied within our guidance within reason. First of all, it's a very strong labor market and separate our exempt workforce, our professional workforce from non-exempt.Our non-exempt workforce is where we feel the pressure. Non-exempt workforce, there's various areas of our value chain. We have about 12,000 lobotomist. We have over 3,500 couriers running our logistics operations in automobiles. We have thousands of what we call specimen processors. And so, if you look at the front end of our value chain, that's where we see some pressure.So what we're finding and it's all very local, is that we have pressure in some of those geographies to up our wages more than we have historically, because we have to be competitive with other competitors, if you will, for those resources. So that's putting pressure on our wage bill. So, Mark, do you want to give a perspective on what that means in terms of scale?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So we're not going to size it specifically. But as Steve mentioned, this competition for those areas doesn't just come from the lab industry or specifically for healthcare. Obviously, with lobotomist, it's healthcare. But when you think about couriers, people drive vehicles are desired by multiple industries.And then, the same thing for the specimen processing, which generally is, I don't like the term, but unskilled labor. And so, there's many, many other industries as well that might be a target for that labor. And so, we are not really responding. I'll answer a question that you didn't ask, but might be in people's mind to increases in minimum wage.We don't generally have people at minimum wage. It's really more responding to market forces in the specific markets where we were finding higher levels of attrition and finding it harder to attract the talent that they need. So, really, as we look at this in the near term, it's an increase to our annual wage inflation. But in the longer run we see the value coming back in lower turnover and higher quality employees.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That's helpful. And then just on the $0.15 dilutive from the investments in advanced diagnostics, can you help us unpack that impact? And then, just a bit more details on how to think about the margin trends for FY 2020 and beyond? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: If I heard the question correctly, you're asking for some color around Blueprint Genetics of the $0.15. And just provide a little bit of strategic logic and operation and how this will work? So, again, we're investing in advanced diagnostics. We have shared that we want to continue to accelerate it.We just reported that if you look at our genetic and esoteric testing was up by about 5% last year. We continue to invest in that in a number of areas. And, specifically, we believe the acquisition of Blueprint Genetics bring some nice capabilities and a proven commercial organization into Quest. It brings us some nice capabilities atypically related to the variant interpretation that I talked about in my remarks. And then also specifically applying that to some of the specialty categories. They have over 200 panel tests today.And so, if you look at their coverage, okay and their depth of interrogation of the data. It provides us a nice capability to leverage what they've already done but also bring to that where we want to do more, typically around rare diseases where we like and interrogate the data to find the insight. So we're really encouraged about the capability we're just onboard. And Mark? We talked about the impact on our earnings in 2020. Want to provide some color to it?
Mark Guinan: Yes, sure. So I would differentiate these investments from the wage inflation and arguably the wage inflation has increased in our long-term cost structure all other things equal. And the reason we call these out is because we don't expect these to be long-term dilutive, certainly Blueprint not only will turn from being dilutive to accretive over a period of time but as Steve mentioned, the capabilities that it brings to us to actually create value in other areas including being more competitive winning more business but also reducing the cost structure and other work that we do in this space.The work we're doing on liquid biopsy is something that will come to a point within the next couple of years. And so either we will stop investing or hopefully self investing and be successful. So it will no longer be a drag on our earnings. And then certainly the work we're doing around low-cost sequencing is also a short-term investment and we're highly confident that that will be successful and certainly will no longer be a drag on our earnings. So these are really temporal investments, that doesn't mean that there won't be other things that we invest in in a couple of years. But these specific investments will be fairly short term.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Erin.
Erin Wright: Hi, good morning. Are the preferred lab networks at this point really helping to steer volume? Can you describe some of the efforts that UNH is implementing to incentivize physicians and patients to actually use the lower cost preferred providers here under the PLN? And then my second part of the question would be, can you elaborate on your lab stewardship program and how that's helping to position yourself as a strategic partner with the hospital labs? And can you give us some metrics maybe how that traction is going with that program? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So Preferred Lab Network, we've said in the past it really got started in the fall where UnitedHealthcare where their fully insured books starting to pull some of the principles of deferred network. And then beyond that it's really just getting started in 2020. And we're optimistic that that will provide us again to gain share. So Mark specifically to...
Mark Guinan: Yes I'd say thus far what's publicly shared by United and we've talked about is they're starting last August. They're really focusing on how to network usage. And they've done a number of things to try to reduce that including sharing that information with members of the PLN, where we can go out and target some of those accounts and explain to the physician why there's a benefit in steering that to a preferred lab member including importantly the quality and other things that really limited the number of people that were included in the preferred lab network.But they're also doing some other things with the physician directly that you probably should ask United about as they've shared with us that they're giving incentives for them to above and beyond what we might do when we go and call on them and explain why it's in the patient's best interest, we're also doing some things to make in the physician's best interest to move away from using out-of-network providers. And there's a fair amount of out-of-network amongst all of the major payers that is a source of higher cost and quite often not the quality that you'll find in the members of the PLN.In terms of the PLN itself as we shared there were a couple of states that were rolled out in their fully insured book. Beginning in January they're small accounts, they expanded more broadly. And in the middle of the year there's going to be pretty much a full rollout including their larger members and they're fully insured book throughout that time they still have to sell the members where ultimately even though it's fully insured over time have to agree because it could have implications for premiums and so on all of that takes time.And then there's the sponsored plans, which is the next step. So this is a long-term initiative that certainly is reaping some benefit. But it's not in terms of the step change where this is going to overnight move on dramatically. And that's why we talked about multiyear tailwind for a lot of the efforts because some of this is going to take some time. So all in the right direction, but something that is going to take a while to get to where its ultimate level would be.
Steve Rusckowski: So Erin you asked about the lab stewardship program. And let me bring it back to, again we're actively working our strategy to build relationships with health systems, hospital health systems. We've been actively working on this for a number of years. And when we go into a health system and it is at the C-suite. We talked about our ability to help them meet their hospital more efficient and effective in diagnostics.And then secondly, as part of that the sophisticated testing that is sending out, we could do more for them and we can do a better job of how we manage that.And then thirdly, when we always get into those conversations, we then now with PAMA. And with the pressure for commercial sales, we have conversations around their outreach business. Does that continue to make sense for them to have it? In the case of more there was an example where again a hospital services business. So as we get in there it's all about building a relationship. We help them manage their diagnostics.And our last stewardship program is being deployed through many of our good accounts, it's going quite well. And this is all about getting smarter about diagnostics. And it goes back to the notion of a triple lane, it's about better health care, it's about better experience that's at lower cost. And what we're finding is as you get more analytics like everything, what you find out is there's over utilization and we need to get rid of that to make them more efficient. But what we're also finding is there's under utilization. And so we become more of a consultative adviser in terms of diagnostics. And one thing that we like to talk about is there's nothing more expensive than a bio-diagnosis for a hospital setting.And so with their last stewardship program and where the relationships, we're working proactively with our partners to be able to deliver a better answer for the specialist. And again Memorial Hermann is a great recent example of the listening to our story, understanding what we're going to do for them and now we have a new partner in one of the largest cities in the United States. So we're really encouraged about the progress we've made over the number of years in the prospects in front of us.
Mark Guinan: Operator next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Bill.
Bill Quirk: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Bill Quirk: I guess, a multipart question here, Steve. So first, we appreciate that there's considerable pullback by some providers, concerning the executive order around hospital pricing transparency. However, since this does include diagnostics, should we be thinking about this as a potential added risk from a long-term reimbursement standpoint? And then also, and separately, given the interest in the preferred lab networks by a number of payers, not just United, should we expect additional announcements in 2-20 concerning some of the new formation of these? Thanks, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, thanks, Bill. The first part of your question has to do with transparency and surprise bills and pushback from providers, about that, and its complex, as you know. But going back to my prepared remarks, we believe, if you just look at the value proposition we bring into marketplace, we'd like to get more and more exposure to the prices that are out there for us.Because as I said, with the full confidence, we believe, we're the best deal in town. And so, making sure consumers see that, making sure physicians see that, making sure that plans are working with us to move more of their laboratory services to a great value provider like Quest Diagnostics is what the strategy is all about.And so, the more visibility of that is a good thing for us. And we're doing this with the plans and the preferred lab network is part of that. We're also doing this with employers with the plans, because as those employers look at their employee cost of healthcare, they're looking at what they can do to help their employees out and we believe our category is a good example of where they can do that. But if they do it for us, they could do it also with other healthcare services like radiology and physical therapy. So, we think it's a good opportunity for us.And then, finally, you asked the question about preferred lab network. We continue to work with other partners. We have the nationals, but we also have a number of regionals. And as you know, we enjoy a large presence in Florida. If you look at Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield, even though they haven't announced a preferred lab network, we are very strong in Florida and we have a great relationship with them.So in essence, you could say they are our preferred labs, even though we haven't announced it. So as we work through where we go with this long-term, you'll see what others are willing to provide publicly. But this will continue to be a trend that we'll keep on working. Mark?
Mark Guinan: And when you think about the preferred lab network, whether or not another major payer is very overt in announcing a preferred lab network or not, you will see. But some of the elements within the preferred lab network, we already had for some payers before our relationship with United. And some of them have actually expanded some of those.So when you touch on what are some of the advantages of the preferred lab network, one of them is, when I described the out-of-network usage and having the payer actually partner with us to educate physicians around the cost of prescribing high -- the high price out-of-network labs and how that impacts our patients with deductibles and how it could impact denials and so on and so forth. So we're doing that with a number of payers.There's also a plan, a very large managed Medicaid plan that had put in some pre-authorization requirements for certain test categories, where they were concerned about the size of the panels and the appropriate clinical appropriateness of some of the offerings. And because we -- and then, some others, it's not us alone, do it appropriately, they've actually created, in essence, what they call a gold card, which means that we're exempt from that pre-authorization.So not only does that avoid a headwind for us, so that’s the second thing, is it makes it easier for physicians to order from us. They don't have to go through perhaps. So actually in essence it should steer more work to us. And then finally another one I'd comment is in the past as we described it what we do outreach acquisitions. It was a huge windfall for everybody. Other than us, certainly we would still get great economic benefit as I've laid out in the past at Investor Day is about how they're very, very accretive despite the pricing dissynergies.And so what we've partnered with a number of payers on is that actually we share in some of that price savings initially. So it's not all a windfall for the payers and others. But actually some of that value comes to us. So a less severe pricing dissynergy headwind for the first couple of years.So that's just a couple of examples that you may not hear a very, very over an announcement about a preferred lab network and where the payers are partnering with us in the areas that they know we bring critical value to really drive more volume towards us.
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: How are you, Donald?
Donald Hooker: Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Donald Hooker: Yes. So on the heels of this sizable Memorial Hermann PLS deal. I just was hoping to maybe get a sense kind of maybe looking back and looking forward of kind of the momentum you're seeing in the PLS business? I think a couple of years ago, you loosely sized it for the investor community saying it would be maybe 50 basis points of top line growth that might be just question I'm wrong but that was a couple of years ago. Maybe can you update kind of what your thinking there and the current conditions?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, yes. So, thank you for the question. And our professional lab services business is something we've built over time. We've got a nice referenceable book of business and clients that we continue to build on. We actually did say in our prepared remarks that we announced another relationship in Tennessee.Memorial Hermann is yet another example. And what I'll share with you – you'll hear more about more professional and lab services business going forward. In our 2019 results we did have some growth from it. I'll Mark comment on the specifics around that.But we believe it's an important element of again walking in and having an engaged conversation with good delivery systems around their lab strategy. And helping them make their hospital laboratory better, more efficient and more effective as an important part of that. And so now we have a proven trucker being able to do it. We have augmented that with their lab stewardship program and then we also have logged with that with our clear ability to be able to acquire outreach businesses. It will provide more of the sophisticated testing, particularly around advanced diagnostics. So it's moving along nicely and it's becoming a real stand for us and delivering the growth that we expected. Mark?
Mark Guinan: And I think the 50 basis points is plus or minus a reasonable number. Certainly as we look at the last couple of years the contribution that could accelerate because we do do some PLS deals, as we mentioned this morning state of Tennessee that are just PLS deals stand-alone. But then as part of what we really still believe will be increased indices broad deals with hospital partners around selling the outreach around getting that reference work and doing the PLS deal, especially if some of these are larger systems.And we have a very deep pipeline. PLS contribution could grow to be larger than that. Certainly we'll talk about that as we see that happening. So yes, the 50 basis points is reasonable, very happy with it and that's something that we're hoping and certainly could see accelerating down the road.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes the interesting thing too that we mentioned in the press release for Memorial Hermann, but many of these systems also have their own plans -- their own health plan. So what we're finding is kind of a secondary benefit has become their preferred or their exclusive provider laboratory service within their plans, and Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. So it's an added benefit of having these relationships.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Matt.
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the retail side. As that footprint continues to grow, could you characterize with that volume in terms of just site shift versus incremental market share shift as you alluded to on the network access side?And then in the past you've described potential opportunities to expand the relationships with some of those retail providers in terms of the services that you're involved in any progress that you anticipate there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah absolutely. So first of all if you think about our value chain. We actually do the draws for about 40% of our volume, okay? That's not through our true bottoms that are even each in service centers or in physician offices. That trend is actually moving more to our site. So we're doing more and more to us. It's a small gradual shift to us, which says 60% is still provided by physicians or our clients and hospitals. So think about the our front end if you will of the value chain that way.What we believe is if we have a better experience and in better locations, we're going to be able to get share. And so we believe that we're we are growing the front end that we deliver ourselves faster than our overall growth because of this shift in the marketplace and also the experience being good as well.And as far as other relationships all -- this is a health care service providers are looking at their strategy. We mentioned Walmart earlier, they're a big player in health care. They're getting bigger with the opening of some clinics. We have great partnership with Aetna, and onwards with CVS, CVS Health is building up pumps, which is an extension of what they've done with their MinuteClinic. We were a partner of theirs with MinuteClinic.And as that strategy evolves we'll have a presence with them and others as we go forward. So -- and also we will continue to organically to do some of the retailization if you will of our fleet of patient service centers, because we do see opportunities within local druggists to do some of it ourselves. So it is a multiyear strategy that we keep on making progress against and partnerships continue to be an important part of it.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good morning, guys. Yeah, so my question is on Memorial Hermann. So do you think that with this it's one of the largest hospital systems out there? Do you think this is finally the proof that outside of UMASS you're starting to get traction on the hospital side?And then I guess if you guys don't mind just giving us kind of a view on what the tail benefit is from these comprehensive PLS deals where you're buying the outreach, you're getting the reference and basically the whole lab business for the whole hospital system?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So first of all as we said, I think we have a lot more interest today than we did two or three years ago with integrated delivery systems. But what we just announced with Memorial Hermann is complex and so these deals just take a longer period of time.We do already have over the years a number of significant systems. If you remember when we bought the outreach business from Dignity, which is a major player on the West Coast. PeaceHealth is another example. I'll remind you we have a long-standing relationship with UPMC in Pittsburgh. We have a long-standing relationship with INTEGRIS in Oklahoma City.So we have a long history of working actively with these great delivery systems long before the deal before -- with UMass. And I would argue this is a good example of a large system in a large city coming in our direction. And a good proof point that there will be more like this to come.And the reason why Memorial Hermann chose us is because we have this proven history of being able to pull it off. We can help them with their hospital. We can help them with the reference work, we can buy their outreach business. We can integrate it. We could tie in to their physicians, we can help them with their health plan. So we have a long-standing history and credibility with a referenceable book of clients that serves us well.Because laboratory testing is an essential part of running an integrated delivery system, it's 2% of costs, 70% healthcare decision-making. It's critical that we're working with a partner, they get it right. So, Brian, I think, we do continue to see this as a good indication that there will be more to come. And this is a major system that we're happy to be able to announce.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Good morning
Mark Guinan: Hi, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Just, I was hoping you can give a little bit more on sort of the underlying volume and pricing mix assumptions just embedded in guidance? And then, secondly, just quickly, I wanted to clarify the wage pressure comment. I though, Mark, I heard you say a couple of hundred basis points higher, just want to make sure I heard that right? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Yeah. So let me address the wage piece and then I'll turn it back to Steve on the volume of the guidance. So no, a couple of hundred basis points of the total wage pressure. So what we're saying is that, historically, it was at a given level. And we were pretty consistent with how we did our annual merit increases. And then, this year we're funding more increases. So, in total, it's several hundred basis points.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. And so, if you look at our initial guidance of 1 to 3, contemplated in 1 to 3 growth are the acquisitions that we've talked about, which we historically have done, which says that there's organic growth in there. We've also said that we have less reimbursement pressure in 2020 than we had in 2019. We've sized that to be about 200 basis points of an idea of the scale. That helps us some. Okay?We then have these new deals that we just talked about, they're going to provide PLS. As we said, they're going to start to ramp particularly in the second quarter. So that will help us with some of the growth. And so, therefore, when you go through all the math, we have to have volume growth. And we have to pick up share and that's implied in our guidance.So entirely consistent. Okay? What we've told to you before, is that 2019 was a good start. But it doesn't start with 2019. We're going to continue to build on that momentum. And we will continue to see access improvement of gains and share with the preferred lab network, with the other payers that we brought into it, our full last year and that implied in our guidance as grow through acquisition. And growth through market share gains related to work with the payers and other parts of our strategy.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore. Your line is open.
Mike Newshel: Thanks. Can you just comment on seasonality for 2020? We obviously have the extra day from leap year in the first quarter, but are there any other calendar effects or comp issues just to call out?
Mark Guinan: Yes. I mean, it gets a little bit complicated. So there's an extra calendar day in Q1. But it's actually not really a full day because of the data we could it is. So it gets a little bit complicated. So there's – in the year there's definitely an extra day. There's a chunk of that in the first quarter. If you recall in 2019 we called out an extra day in Q3. So you should think about that when you size Q3 because that will not repeat the way the calendar is falling.And then there's the typical seasonality around some of the floating holidays. And then the last thing I'd point out is that some of the fixed holidays in terms of the day of the week matters. So when you look at where things like the 4th of July and Christmas and New Year's fall, there can be a difference, the worst being if those are a Tuesday, Wednesday and the best thing if those are weekends. So I'd point to those being some of the things. But you – I'm sure you can imagine that within a 200 basis point range of revenue guidance we've contemplated all the scenarios that might play out there.
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. So obviously a lot of moving parts in the guidance today including the investments you're making. I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more explicitly what the guidance is embedded from an op margin perspective? If I looked at this year and took out the United out of network impact, I would have seen margins I think roughly stable year-over-year. So do you think that's achievable again as we go into 2020? And if you can add on any expectations for below the line items, the interest expense, tax rate anything we should be considering there that would be different than 2019 in our models? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: So let me address the latter. Interest expense and tax rate will be pretty consistent. The other area where we've had a number of people ask questions recently as equity earnings. And that growth has been certainly largely driven by our JV with IQVIA our Q Square JV that we set up several years ago that have been continuing to drive earnings growth.One of the investments that we called out our liquid biopsy investment actually comes to us through an investments that we have with a third party. And the accounting rules dictate that we have to take our share of those losses and even months an investment in this company. That will be in the equity earnings line so that will dampen somewhat the equity earnings growth but it's all again in that $0.15 that I called out earlier. So I'll turn it back to Steve for the other part of your question margins.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, margins, we've been consistent where we haven't guided around margins because we have a mix of businesses. We're driving growth and we're driving a return on invested capital. And we had provided outlook around growth and earnings per share. We think that's the best way for us to drive shareholder value. So we're not going to really comment on what the margins will be year-on-year. But we go through the math, you can get it from private markets could be based upon the top line growth and what we have guided as far as our EPS growth.
Mark Guinan: And the other thing is that margins are not given. So if we're at the low end of that revenue guidance versus the high end, it will have the impact on margins because as we've shared previously that organic revenue growth comes through a higher drop-through than our fully loaded margin. And we're depending on that as I shared with Ricky with her initial question. Our invigorate program alone can offset in a large proportion of the headwinds. But really the bottom line growth and the margin -- any margin expansion will come through that organic revenue growth.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Hi. One clarification and one strategic question. Clarification on the fourth quarter, I was curious if you could weigh in on how much you might have contributed? I know that Hooper Holmes acquisition last year had a little bit of that?And then strategically just given the dilution associated with the Blueprint acquisition that's, obviously, unusual in terms of the framework of deals that Quest has done in the past. I'm curious if you could just weigh in just the appetite for deals like that versus -- I guess what we're accustomed to in terms of tuck-ins on the outreach side?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, the Blue was a small competitor. As we've shared in the past in this point of care, we certainly get some flu testing when the flu season spike. So yeah it was a little bit of tailwind, but not anything notable.In terms of our strategy, I want to ask Steve…
Steve Rusckowski: So Jack we're always looking at aligning our adjustments around our strategy and having a balanced approach. And related to acquisitions we shared, typically what you're seeing for us is acquisitions falling in one of three categories. One is regional laboratories. We've talked about Boston Clinical Labs that’s a small regional laboratory we just acquired. We did one in Missouri last year. So we'll continue to pursue those.Second hospital outreach business is Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. We like those deals are accretive to our earnings. They provide real growth. We really like the stickiness if you will of the customer relationships we take on board and it keep capability building. And so Blueprint Genetics is an example of capability building.We thought it would be prudent for us to make an investment there. We think it's very consistent with our strategy. It's modest in size, but it's going to give us a nice capability around bioinformatics, around the variant, interpretation that I spoke to. It'll allow us to achieve that strategy of accelerating growth in advanced diagnostics, which is a category we shared in the past, our definition in genetics and molecular we do over $1 billion. And we believe that that is prospectively a great opportunity for us to continue to invest and that's why we made it.So we will continue down that path of a balanced approach consistent with our strategy with deals that we can make money for shareholders and trust that will make any deal including the ones we just announced, we have a path to value creation for our shareholders.
Mark Guinan: And just one final comment. I mean typically Jack with our acquisitions the value creation has to come directly from the book of business we're buying. And while certainly the book of business we're buying from Blueprint will become better from a profitability standpoint. Really the value creation goes well beyond that book. And as we've mentioned earlier capabilities it brings will benefit everything we do in that space. And so the capability, a description that Steve gives really means that it's going to create better margins and better competitiveness in space outside the specific test menu and book of business that we're acquiring.
Jack Meehan: Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, last question.
Operator: Yes, our last question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Ann. Good morning.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. So, I just want to ask about cash flow beyond 2020? I know your CapEx is a little higher, just because of the new facility, should we assume that CapEx run rate goes down after 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: Typically, I don't give any kind of guidance beyond the current year, Ann. But what I will say is that, this is the largest year for Clifton, 2020, we're expecting to be operational in 2021. The Clifton facility has been the driver certainly this year, last year and even back into 2018 and the increase in our relative level of capital spending. We haven't announced any similar plans like that. So you might infer from that that capital spending might come down a little beyond 2020.
Ann Hynes: Have you disclosed how much you've been investing in CapEx for Clifton?
Steve Rusckowski: We haven't by year, what we have disclosed that it was about $0.25 billion investment over three years.
Ann Hynes: Okay.
Mark Guinan: You might have seen as well that we recorded a gain on the property sale with self focus…
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So we sold our Teterboro property and we're going to lease back right now until we exited and moved to Clifton and that was a big contributor to the year-over-year GAAP earnings gain. We adjusted that out of our adjusted income, but it was a nice cash inflow.And as you know, Ann, that goes into financing, not into operating cash flow. And actually the tax on the gain actually goes against operating cash flow in 2020. So from an accounting perspective, it's a little bit disconnected. But we actually got quite a bit of cash from the sale of Teterboro at the end of fourth quarter of 2019.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So when we built the business case on Clifton investment, we assumed a certain sell price for the Teterboro facility. We really exceeded that expectation. So we feel good about the business case and what we're putting our capital budget against.
Ann Hynes: All right. Great. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Ann.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. So thank you very much. Appreciate your engagement. We appreciate your support and look forward to seeing you in our travels. Have a great day.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections – including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are Compound Annual Growth Rates. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn. And thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I’ll discuss the third quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2019 guidance. We had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth. Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the year. For the third quarter, we grew revenues 3.5% despite continued reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.56, up nearly 3% from the same period in 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up nearly 5%. Volume growth remained very strong at 5.1% and year-to-date volume growth is up 4.3%. Now, I’d like to briefly update you on the three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace that we discussed at last year’s Investor Day. And as you know they are our PAMA, our expanded network access and increased consumerization of healthcare. First, PAMA, the reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. And there is mounting evidence that PAMA is hurting this industry. We see and hear the negative impact that PAMA is having whenever we evaluate potential lab acquisition targets. And CAP Today, a respected industry journal, recently highlighted how PAMA and other reimbursement pressures are already starting to drive consolidation in the industry. As you know, here at Quest, we took a series of actions earlier this year to further reduce our costs to align with PAMA cuts. Some decisions that we made were difficult, and our employees have felt the changes. More PAMA reimbursement cuts are coming in 2020. Our industry continues to fight PAMA’s flawed implementation in the courts and in Congress. We recently received a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals decision to allow the lower court to review the merits of ACLA’s case. ACLA submitted its initial brief last week, and a decision is expected in 2020. This is encouraging news, and so is the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, or LAB Act, introduced in June by six members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and now with nearly 40 cosponsors. ACLA is also working to build support for a Senate companion bill to include the LAB Act in a larger end-of-year health care extender bill. The second fundamental change affecting our industry is our expanded network access and payers becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend. We are partnering with UnitedHealthcare to move testing volume to high-value labs like Quest from high-cost hospital and out-of-network labs. UnitedHealthcare began offering a product with zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges for laboratory testing for the majority of fully insured lives in select states on October 1. UnitedHealthcare will also make the lab savings program available for their self-insured employer groups beginning in 2020. And then finally, we continue to see the ongoing consumerization of health care with more and more health care costs borne by consumers. In September, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the annual premiums for employer sponsored health care coverage grew 5% for families, surpassing $20,000 for the first time. The number of employees in high deductible health plans has increased over the past decade. Turning to our recent progress, the first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements. To grow 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health with data analytics and extended care services. Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. As we’ve said before, most deals in our pipeline are taking more time to develop than they have in the past. Conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. Hospital CEOs are also interested in how we can help them with their professional lab services and taking on more of their reference work. As a result of this complexity, proposed relationships take longer to develop.  Hospital systems are also interested in learning more about our recently unveiled Quest Lab Stewardship, an innovative new service that employs machine learning to help optimize laboratory test utilization. We have partnered with hc1, a health care IT company, to provide a solution that gives Quest a differentiated offering in a competitive hospital marketplace.  We continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. In aggregate, growth continues across our top 50 major health plan customers. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included drug monitoring, continued strength in tuberculosis testing in both QuantiFERON and T-Spot; STD testing; and CardioIQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth in the quarter. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We have some examples which include using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. We now have more than 8.2 million patients now making appointments and receiving their results through our MyQuest digital platform. We’ve continued to drive productivity improvements across logistics, patient services and lab services, enabling us to reduce our overall cost per laboratory requisition. We are also putting new innovations to work while reducing costs. We are in the process of consolidating and simplifying our immunoassay platforms, moving to a single supplier. This approach enables greater throughput, a more efficient footprint, and is expected to save tens of millions of dollars per year. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through our financial performance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.96 billion, up 3.5% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 3.7% compared to the prior year driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.7%. We benefitted from an extra revenue day in the third quarter, while the impact of Hurricane Dorian was a modest volume headwind. The net impact of these two items added roughly 1% to organic growth in the quarter.  Recall, we also highlighted last quarter that we recently exited some capitated contracts. In the third quarter, this change represented a headwind of nearly 1% to our organic volume growth.  Importantly, we continued to see a modest acceleration in our volume growth associated with our UnitedHealthcare contract. Revenue per requisition declined by 1.2% versus the prior year primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure.  Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the third quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts.  Reported operating income was $313 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million, or 17.9% of revenues, compared to $333 million, or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Additionally, patient concessions are down year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.56 in the quarter compared to $1.53 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up approximately 5% from $1.68 last year. Cash provided by operations was $895 million year-to-date versus $905 million last year. Capital expenditures were $228 million year-to-date, compared to $232 million a year ago. Now, turning to guidance, our updated outlook for 2019 is as follows: Revenues expected to be approximately $7.72 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be between $5.48 and $5.53 and adjusted EPS, to be between $6.45 and $6.50. Cash provided by operations is still expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: To summarize, we had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth. Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the rest of the year. Now, we’d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ralph.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Good morning. Good morning. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask on the pricing side, and just your comments on sort of the higher reimbursement pressure. I guess what’s – just help us on sort of what’s driving that outside of PAMA? And then if you could maybe just level set the expectation on sort of where expectations are for that pricing mix that kind of going forward, exclusive of PAMA? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want to…
Mark Guinan: Sure. So as we’ve shared before in the Investor Day last year, then also coming into this year, this year’s pricing pressure is primarily driven by two factors, one is PAMA. The second one is getting back in with United. We moved from out-of-network rates to a market-based in network rate. So obviously, we have grown our volume dramatically. As we’ve said this year, we expected and we – still we are delivering enough incremental value to offset the price set, but it is a significant price headwind relative to the rates we were being reimbursed as out-of-network lab. You don’t have the typical pricing pressure that this industry has faced in the past. We’ve talked about it being for around 100 basis points or less. Number of those pricing pressures are coming from the client bill, it’s not all third-party reimbursement where we’re contractually agreed with the health plan and what those rates are in the hospital business and also where we sell directly to physicians and they’re allowed to build a third party. There is a lot of competition. A lot of pricing pressure in that area and so while we’ve talked about, we’re going to be price disciplined when we certainly walked away from some contracts that haven’t made sense. The reality is that it’s a very competitive environment. And that has not really changed. So the big change over the last two years, obviously PAMA last year, but it wasn’t fully implemented, because you had some offsets to it in the first year that we’ve talked about previously. This was the first year of the full 10% of PAMA. And then additionally, we have the United price as well. And going forward, as we shared, we would expect this to get back to more of its historical rate. I’m not going to give any specific guidance for a given year. But there is no reason to believe once we get through the transition period in the United that we should be really facing in kind of the traditional pricing pressure in PAMA. 
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. And could you just quantify that UNH pricing pressure this year?
Steve Rusckowski: Ralph, it’s going to be $40 million to $50 million.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Bill.
Bill Quirk: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Bill Quirk: So Steve, I want to follow up on a comment that you made concerning the decision to consolidate the immunoassay vendors. Can you speak a little bit about whether or not there’s an opportunity here to consolidate some of your other testing methods things like clinical chemistry and hematology and such. And if so, can you just help us think a little bit about the timing? This is something we should think about over the next couple of years to help offset some of the PAMA pressure. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure, absolutely. So Bill, we were working on this for about seven years, getting smarter and more strategic with all our suppliers, and so we’ve done a lot of consolidation in the past and we’ll continue to do more in the future. So as far as immunoassays, we’re close to deciding on the supplier. I believe that will be announced shortly who that is. Of course it’s a nice opportunity. And this is all part of our 3% productivity gains that we are dialing in to be able to offset PAMA. We need it to be able to offset PAMA deliver on the earnings uplift that we’ve provided at Investor Day. And so part of that 3% is working with our suppliers and part of that working with the suppliers and the example of that is immunoassay while there is others. Another example would be the automation we’re putting in place in some of our newer facilities, particularly we’re investing this year in our branding facility here in New Jersey – in Clifton, New Jersey. It’s a big project for us. That will have us new platform, but equally it will have us our latest approach to automation, which will increase our productivity, but also allow us to consolidate some facilities into one, so we get some productivity gains from that. But that’s all part of that 3% when we need that 3% to offset the price pressure particularly with PAMA next year and maybe the year after.
Mark Guinan: And I just want to add some color there, Bill, make sure they understand this is not just consolidating our purchases. This is actually a new innovation in the platform where we can do multiple tests that previously were performed on separate pieces of equipment on a single piece of equipment. So this will drive, not just procurement efficiencies, but actually will drive operational efficiencies in our labs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Donald.
Donald Hooker: Great. Good morning. So I – maybe you guys in terms of that new collaboration you announced with hc1. I know you guys do a lot of interesting things in the population health space. I’m just trying to maybe – can you elaborate on that a little bit? What exactly are you doing? I mean is this something that I guess you’re...
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. Sure. What we’re doing for our hospital client as part of our five-point strategy, we talk to them about three things in regards to the lab strategies. One is, can we make them more efficient in running their inpatient laboratory? So this is where we talk about Professional Laboratory Services or sometimes we use the acronym PLS, and we continue to have that dialogs about making them more efficient. We can – with good evidence now, save them about 10% to 20%. Part of that typically also is looking at the sophisticated send out of testing referred to as reference testing. And in that regard, consolidated was buying from – like potentially give them a better price. But the third part that we’re looking at and this new offering allows as a tool to do a better job of getting smarter about what they’re testing in the hospital is interrogate their order patterns and look for variation of their order patterns and look at ways of optimizing what the order within the hospital. And there’s two part to that. One is to get more efficient at what you’re ordering. So maybe third quarter as much in some cases, you should also order more because it’s smarter diagnostic workup for the inpatient today, but the second part of this, which is more – even more intriguing what many hospital administrators are interested in is making sure that we have the right diagnosis. And if you look at the total quality and outcomes for our hospital stay, there’s nothing more expensive than buying diagnosis. So what this tool allows us to do is to work with our clients on getting smarter on their inpatient diagnostics and as part of that, we clearly become more strategic than this vendor providing reference testing within that account. And then finally, the third piece of what we work with hospital systems when we have those discussions is you want to stay in the outreach business and we have bought some outreach businesses from hospitals. We have some within our numbers for this year and will continue to aggressively pursue buying outreach businesses as this industry consolidates. And I would tell you that many hospital systems are now well aware of PAMA and well aware of other reimbursement pressures they are having in their laboratory outreach business. So, as we mentioned in our commentary that funnel of discussions continues to grow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Erin.
Erin Wright: Hi. In terms of the timing and magnitude of contributions from the managed care access, I guess, can you break out what you’re seeing in terms of underlying market growth and what portion of volume may be stemming from the managed care contracts and possibly also the PLN in early days and are you still anticipating those contributions to ramp from here? How should we conceptually be thinking about that ramp? I’m not asking for 2020 guidance, but how should we be thinking about that ramp into 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. So what will share with you – we always shared this every quarter. It feels like the market is stable. We don’t see any notable changes in terms of volume increases within the marketplace both outside the hospital, and also inside the hospital so stable. So if you look at volume growth, we’re clearly gaining share. And a large portion of that share of gains is coming from managed care relationships. What we have also said is that our access changes, which is the best in over a decade, we’ll continue to grow. It will continue to grow this year in 2019, but it will also have growth in 2020 and probably in 2021 as we take advantage of that opportunity that we see in front of those. That will be helped in 2020 for certain with – for lab network, particularly with UnitedHealthcare. So you should look for in 2020 continued growth again because of our expanded network access. So Mark, anything you’d like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, you asked about the PLN, it’s still very, very early. To this date, I’d say very little, if any growth has come from the PLN is still in front of us, which is the good news. We talked at Investor Day about kind of three tranches of volume growth, Erin. We sized the new managed care access at about $1 billion at our price, our fair share. We fully expect to get to our fair share. But it’s going to take several years there was a easier to convert accounts obviously came quickly, we call them Quest loyalist where we had the rest of the book of the office and they were sending some of the managed care work that we were out-of-network to those, to other labs that were in-network and they immediately moved that to us once we were in network. We never had some of the accounts where they have multiple labs. We showed you the picture when they were three, four sometimes five boxes outside. We’ve done a better job of consolidating some of that getting a more larger share of wallet per se in those positions that will take a period of time, but certainly, we’ve gotten some growth from that, but that will continue into the future. And then there was the ones where we have had no, none of the work and a lot of that is in the hospital stay, hospital outreach and in some of the physician-owned laboratories that’s where we really think the preferred lab network is going to be a big driver. We would be able to have a very simple message to patients. Hey, if you use one of the preferred labs and obviously we’re one of the five zero out-of-pocket. That’s a very simple message instead of trying to compare how expensive, what option might be the there, it’s free to view if you use this lab. So we’re very confident, very excited. This will be a multi-year tailwind and we’re going to get to that fair share eventually of about $1 billion in our price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Michael.
Michael Newshel: Hi, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on that. Do you have any visibility at this point after the selling season from United on the level of uptake in the self-insured base for the PLN for 2020
Mark Guinan: They have not shared specific information, obviously. They are questions you could ask them because we’re not the only preferred lab. So we obviously get the same information that preferred lab network providers do. They talk to us about, as we’ve shared the states where their role in the south making this available, and then they talk to us about the fact that their marketing into those whole insurance sponsored plans for 2020, rolling that out, still very early in that process, and they didn’t give us any specific proportionality or percentage of their overall insured lives that are adapting this, but they – I’m sure you’ve heard them talk about it, we’ve heard them talk publicly and in the conversation we have, they are very, very confident that this is going to be something that people will embrace and that is going to make a difference.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Kevin Ellich: Hey, Steve. Two quick things. So first M&A pipeline. You said that the deals are taking a little bit longer to materialize. Wondering if the environment has changed or if this is what you’ve experienced historically. And then also could you talk about maybe any tailwinds you’re seeing from the opioid testing and the opportunities within behavioral health facilities?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Sure. So on the first one, as I mentioned in our opening remarks, these deals are getting bigger and more complicated. And if it’s more complex, it takes more time and there is good news in that and there is bad news in that. One is, it takes more time. That’s bad news. The good news is, the bigger the more complicated. It’s therefore we’re clearly having discussion around how they could be – their partner for laboratory services around the three topics that I mentioned earlier. And what I did also share is that the interest level around what we can do when partnering continues to grow because of more people are well aware of the pressure on this portion of their business. I would say that was not nearly where we were last year at this time. So if you look at our growth rate from acquisition year-to-date, they’re – it’s just a little shy of that 2% we indicated last year. We’re well north of that 2%. We still feel confident that over an extended period of time, we’ll continue to be 2% or greater. And so, we feel confident between the three buckets that we acquire. One is hospital outreach, [indiscernible] (0:29:03) lot of engagement around that. Second is, regional laboratories. As I mentioned in my remarks, there continues to be interest in evaluating options for smaller operators because of the pressures that they see. And then finally, we continue to build capabilities and we have a number of acquisitions in the past around that. A good example of this immune attack, which is bringing us new capabilities around tuberculosis testing and also fit for an illness testing. So all three continue to be our focus going forward and you will see that and we’re still confident around our guidance we provided around 2% on a CAGR basis over a multi-year period of time.
Mark Guinan: And you asked about opioid testing and the tailwind certainly our prescription drug monitoring business, which is subset of that opioid testing has been a strong growth engine for us for a number of years and continues to be a nice growth driver. Like anything else, when something gets large enough, the payers start putting in policies and all sorts of barriers to reimbursement that dampen that somewhat, despite some of those restrictions around frequency of testing, pre-authorization, and other things that they’re putting in, it’s still a nice growth driver for us. It just will be even larger if they hadn’t made those changes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi Jack, good morning.
Jack Meehan: Good morning. So I just wanted to focus on the margins here, so in the quarter, nice to see the expansion. Can you maybe walk us through the moving parts between pricing impact, efficiency programs in the calendar? And as we look to 2020, as you pull all these pieces together, do you think – what’s the right way to think about, are margins flat is PAMA too big of a headwind to grow through? What are some of the things that you’re thinking about?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so let me first touch Jack on the longer term. So I’m not going to talk to 2020. But what I did talk about at the Investor Day was on a full year outlook that we could grow earnings faster than the top line. And talked about the assumption, although that may not play out depending on how we deploy our cash, but that’s on the flat share count, so therefore we’re actually growing earnings not earnings per share. So that implies margin expansion that I can tell you that we are not expecting some sort of the tax windfall. So that’s before tax margin growth. I can’t assure you that will happen every quarter. I can’t assure you that I’m not going to get into 2025 adding every year, but over multiple years, we expect to grow our earnings faster than our top line. And it’s really having the efficiency program continue, we talked about it being 3% per year, we’ve got really good at that. We need that. We’ll continue to do that with over time tempering pricing headwinds. In this quarter, we shared the pricing headwinds of 250 basis points. Obviously, that all drops to the bottom line for a very small piece for the bad debt element, but basically it drops to the bottom line. So we had enough efficiency and some lift from volume, how much of that is the extra day, how much of that is just the volume growth. Obviously, we have a higher drop through we shared on organic volume growth, enough to offset the pricing headwinds and basically hold our margin pretty flat in the quarter. So I may be getting any more precise than that, I’d be stretching my credibility and ability to give that map. So I would just say that, you can see that despite some pretty significant pricing headwinds, is how their margins in this quarter and that as we continue to drive strong organic volume growth and deliver our 3%, over a period of time, we’re going to grow our earnings faster.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Could you talk a little bit about the fourth quarter guidance? The revenue guidance is in line with model, the EPS fall short. I’m just wondering if there is any accelerated spending, are you may be trying to position better for 2020 by spending more in 2019? Can you give us a little color around the fourth quarter and may be higher thinking about spending in 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so we’ve raised our guidance for the year. Importantly, we’re signaling stronger finish to the year than we did at the beginning of the year. And until now we’ve not signaled anything above original guidance. So, hopefully people are taking that as a positive message, which we’re saying based on our performance through three quarters of the year and what visibility we have for Q4, we’re feeling confident that we’re going to over-deliver relative to what we said at the beginning of the year. So, in terms of the spending, there’s nothing out of the ordinary in Q4. The only thing that’s out of the ordinary is the easy compare on the top line which we’ve talked about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Good morning guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Brian Tanquilut: Mark just to follow-up on Jack’s question earlier, as I think about the G&A line, you’ve obviously done a good job bringing the G&A percentage down. It flattened out this quarter at about 17.8%. So as I think about your efficiency program, is there more to squeeze out of that or how should we be thinking about that number, it seems like it’s bottoming out here in this 17.8% range?
Steve Rusckowski: Let me start on this. For some reason, there’s always a lot of focus around G&A thinking about a lot of our invigorated savings show up in the expense categories. To the contrary, most of our invigorated savings actually sort of show up in our costs of sales. So if you think about what’s in our expense category, a lot of it is G&A and we’ve made really good progress over the last seven years. So getting more efficient with everything that’s in the category in the P&L, from IT cost to cost running our finance organization, the cost associated with our billing operations, with our relationship with Optum. And outside the general and administration, it’s our sales and marketing costs, which we’re always evaluating and getting more efficient. So we have taken a lot of cost out already. And we’re also leveraging that fixed cost going forward. So the lift we generally get now has to do with that operational leverage related to the top line growth while maintaining the same cost perspective and that’s what you see this year. So a lot of the 3% productivity gain will show up in productivity gains in our cost of sales and not in the expenses. Mark, do you have anything you’d like to add that?
Mark Guinan: Yes, I just would like to add that yes, over time, well Steve is absolutely correct that a large proportion if not a majority of that efficiency is going to drive margin and gross margin will be in the cost of sales will continue to focus on G&A. You can’t really look quarter-to-quarter. In this quarter, we had some couple of high-cost health claims. Over time, we’re going to deliver what we expect, and we’ve done a really good job in managing, it’s very, very minor increases in our self-funded employee healthcare costs. But in a given quarter you get a couple of large claims that can make some noise quarter-to-quarter. So there’s no trend, where there’s – nothing should be read in terms of we’ve lost our ability to continue to drive efficiency, there’s always going to be noise on that line quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. How are you?
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning.
Derik de Bruin: Good. Hey, I just want to follow – two questions. One is a quick follow-up to Bill’s question on the vendor consolidation, platform consolidation. Can you talk a little bit about that process and that how is that going to look and sort of like how you’re judging the different vendors and basically how many you have now particularly the IA and going down? And then the other question I wanted to follow-up on was, when you look at the fourth quarter last year, obviously you had a number of weather issues, but there were issues of patient concessions, lower cash collections, in that sense. Can you just sort of talk about going into the fourth quarter how we are relative to some of these issues, I know you mentioned concessions were down. But just to talk a little bit more about the comps and some of the different things you’re sort of going on in fourth quarter versus…
Steve Rusckowski: Okay, so let me take the first part Mark will take the second part. And the first part, so this is a comprehensive review that we perpetually look at with our suppliers on how we run our laboratories. And we work actively with all our suppliers and that over the past seven years we’ve worked hard to make sure that we really have more of a strategic relationship with all our suppliers, particularly those that are driving a large portion of our spend. And so in that regard, in the IVD automation states, there is consolidation with a number of those platforms as Mark mentioned. And there are a number of suppliers that we buy from that are bringing to the marketplace platforms that will allow us to replace up to about five different work cells with different manufacturers over time. And so what we have done is evaluate those vendors that have a product either in the marketplace or will have a product in the marketplace and we do that through a review process with their sales force on understanding what they’ll have, and what they’ll have for functionality at one time, and then also what the economics around their offering are. We narrowed that down to a few. We actually put in place a few of those platforms in some of our facilities to do some trial runs and then we’re at the final strokes of selecting one of those suppliers going forward. And we believe that we will choose a vendor that meets all the requirements of what we need. And yes, a portion of this is economics. That is how cost – how much productivity we’re going to get for getting more throughput by – being able to consolidate those operations. But also we think about it holistically. You need to make sure that you have good confidence around their ability to service us, good confidence around their quality, good confidence around what’s in their installed base. So it’s a very comprehensive, operational review of who will be our strategic provider for this new platform going forward. And as I said we’re at the final strokes of deciding that and shortly it will be announced.
Mark Guinan: Yes, so on your second question, last year there were a couple of drivers that led us to the change in estimates and obviously the change that we made in Investor Day on our outlook for 2018. Two of them really relate to patients. The first one was that there was more patient responsibility in the year than we saw it coming. And again, we’re always accruing based on a forward-looking expectation of how the revenue is going to play out. We looked at all the available data at the beginning of the year as we shared whether great growth with the amount of people with high deductible plans, we assumed it would be a pretty flat year in terms of the proportion of our revenue from patients. And instead what happened was there were more patient responsibility because the deductibles themselves have gone up markedly as we found out in the September timeframe, which started to actually validate why our cash collections were lagging what we expected from the payer.  So anytime, as we’ve shared, we almost collect a hundred percent of the accepted claims that we’re owed from third party payers. And we’ve shared that we collect about $0.70 on the dollar from patients. So you move 1% of revenue from the third party to the patient. That’s a 30 basis point headwind. So it’s pretty significant. The good news is this year nothing changed significantly from last year. We’re very confident with that, there was no surprise. Obviously going in, we were very, very diligent in watching that, being conservative and there’s no surprises in terms of the proportion of our revenue coming from patients.  The second piece really with patients was we had more patient concessions, not just because more revenue was coming from them, but we actually had some issues we’ve talked about in our lab conversion in the south. And that delays some billing because of the way these conversions go. And because of that the more bills age out, the more you’re going to have concessions less like you are going to collect it. So that’s well behind us, we’re fully converted, we don’t have that anymore. So that’s behind us. And then also related to that we had some higher level of denials because of some time with filings, and so on, because lab conversion themselves we always have been dealing with denials, but they spiked the mid to late last year when we went to this lab conversion. So when you add all those things up, they’ve been cleaned up. The issues that we had last year are well behind us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hi Matt.
Matt Larew: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask for an update on progress in the retail setting, first just broadly in terms of the footprint transformation in the Walmart and Safeway stores. And then also anything that you think you are doing with the new Walmart health initiative. I know there’s a first center that just opened up in Georgia that you’re participating in. 
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so we’re continuing to move forward with our retail strategy as we call it. We have about 2,100 patient service centers and of which can you characterize from above 35% to 40% of those are more retail like, several of which are within Safeway stores and Walmart. The Safeway relationship continues to be a good one. We actually have some new opportunities with Safeway going forward as we kind of work that relationship, so we’re optimistic there. And then second, as we continue to build our presence with Walmart as well. And as you mentioned, they opened up new health concept store and we are their laboratory provider for that store, so they’re still working through how that works. And as you know if you know anything about Walmart, they probably like a lot of things and they’re seeing how well that goes to be able to tune out and we’re working with them proactive on that content going forward.  And as what we said is our goal is to be north of 50% of our patient service centers. So we have some ways to go. And there’s a number of things for us, one is we think it’s a better customer experience, consistent with our strategy, could be the most consumer-friendly laboratory. And we think this will continue to be a differentiator for us in the marketplace. Second is it’s better for employees in a lot of ways and it also allows us to manage the demand and when people are there if we can have larger patient service centers with more providers, it just gives you a lot more operational flexibility to manage the demand based upon location and time of day that patients are coming in over extended period of time. And then finally as the patients really the feedback is quite good. They come in, they have flexibility to walk the store where they wait they have flexibility to do some shopping after their visit. Then we believe that improvement in access and the quality of that access will allow us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and pick up share gradually over time. So it’s going well, we’re pleased with it. And then lastly, I will just say, yes, we have the relationship with Safeway, and yes we have relationship with Walmart, but we continue to work with others in the marketplace, so we continue to work with CVS, Aetna, the MinuteClinic and what we’re doing around their strategy is they are a partner of ours. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Ricky. Good morning.
Mark Guinan: Good morning Ricky.
Alexa Desai: Good morning. This is actually Alexa in for Ricky. Thank you for taking my question.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Alexa.
Alexa Desai: I just wanted to come back to the United Health PLN. You guys mentioned, I think, in your earlier remarks that they’re offering starting October 1, zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges. So I guess my question is, are there any other things that are looking for to do over the balance of the year to continue kind of incentivizing the use of the PLN and how does that zero pocket compared labs not in the network?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark you want to take that?
Mark Guinan: Yes so for labs not in the network, it would be the typical out-of-pocket determined by their plan benefit design. So, with a high deductible plan they just had some sort of cover insurance, but there won’t be zero. So if you think about the average requisition being somewhere between $40 and $50 and typical patient responsibility over time, employing proper responsibility over time by be it 20% to 25% of their healthcare dollars, with the balance being paid for by the company, you can do the math. Now that’s an average. Obviously there’s some very high cost tests. So it’d be a big, big advantage if you have a genetic test or some of the other screening tests that could run hundreds of dollars.  But just the simplicity of the message of not having to worry that, hey the same series of tests would be $50 from a national lab and $500 from this hospital. And what does that mean for me? It’s just you don’t have to worry about it. They’re not as good and it’s not just about price, it’s also about quality, and service and access. So those are all the metrics that were required to get in. We did not change our price with the United in order to get into the pervert lab network, nor do we think anybody else did, but we know we definitely did not. So this is really about the total value of the offering. So if you want to go to the best lab with a great price and also have zero out-of-pocket, it’s a very simple decision for the patient. So that’s important. There’s also in United you should talk about this, but there’s also some things that they’re doing around in sending physicians as well. So it’s not just a patient-driven initiative and I’ll let you talk to United about what they’re doing on that end.  And then obviously you can imagine we’re doing a lot of work in the field with our own commercial sales force to make sure that physicians are aware because this is really good for patients. And most physicians their number one priority is their patient, not their owner, not anybody else, so when they know this was good thing for their patients, they like that. The other thing is it’s a source of some patient satisfaction is getting a bill. And so now you don’t have to call to the office about, hey, that lab you ordered from me, I got a bill, I thought it was covered by the office visit, et cetera, et cetera. So reduces noise for the payer, reduces noise for the physician’s office, obviously a good thing for us and a good thing for patients.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes I’ll just add to what Mark just said, obviously the savings here is zero coinsurance and copayments, but the biggest driver as you’re moving through the laboratory that has a significant lower reimbursement rate then if they’re working with enough for lab network. So the savings to the consumer is very considerable. But the biggest portion of that has to do with the rate differential, not necessarily with the patient responses they might have or not have with us. So a big opportunity and we’re hopeful. As we mentioned it’s just getting started this month, it’s early. But we’re hopeful, this change coupled with the changes that we spoke to take place in 2020 will continue to allow us to grow our presence and our share with United, but also with other payers because we do believe it’s a trend overall in the marketplace. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Mark.
Mark Guinan: Hey Mark.
Mark Massaro: Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess my first question is for you Mark. Obviously the volume growth is the strongest we’ve seen in a long time. You talked about the one extra revenue day in the quarter. But you also talked about health plan access with United continuing to build. So can you just give us a sense for whether or not the 5% growth is a level that you think can continue? Can you just give us a little sense of the puts and takes around some of the drivers there?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so we talked about the fact that the about the fact that the extra day net of hurricane Dorian gives about 100 points. So you can kind of take that math in your thinking. Obviously each corner has different puts and takes in terms of the amount of revenue days, and we usually try to be very transparent about how that all plays out. At the beginning of the year we’ve talked about Q1 having Saturdays and Q3 having an extra day. And obviously next year we have leap year and the quarter’s will play out a little bit differently. And we’ll give you as much transparency on that as possible. But really when you think about the whole year the next year you’re just thinking about generally revenue days are pretty similar year-over-year other than when you have a leap year. And then we did talk about the capitated volume, which is not impacting the bottom line. But if you’re just focused on revenue, at some point next year we laugh that change. So that was about a 100 basis points this quarter. If you recall, we shared about 70 basis points in Q2. So at some point that volume headwind gets behind us.  Now I’ll just to share a little additional color in the quarter, our a employer pre-employment testing business is actually a headwind to our growth that was pretty flat. So that’s the non-DIS if you remember then about a 20 basis point higher growth rate I shared at the beginning of my prepared remarks for our core clinical business. So we’ll see how the pre-employment drug screening business goes, but that was if you want to really think about the clinical business, which is what where we’re benefiting from the expanded access and the volume performance is actually slightly stronger than it may have appeared on the surface. So, is it going to be 5%? Obviously we’re not going to have an extra day every quarter. But is it going to continue to be really positive organic revenue growth into the future? Absolutely that’s our expectation as we work our way to that fair share I talked about as eventually getting into $1 billion of revenue in these new lives with the three expanded access plans.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Hey thanks very much.
Mark Guinan: Hey Eric.
Eric Coldwell: At the end of the quarter you have been head on. But I think it’s always helpful to get maybe a little more emphatic or explicit commentary. It’s all around the M&A and then the capital deployment around M&A. Inorganic growth will really start to abate here in the fourth quarter based on the timing of prior period deals. I’m hoping you can give us some sense on what you’re expecting from inorganic growth in 4Q. Also, you have a long-term model of 2% plus M&A-driven growth. To the extent that the analysts have built in a place holder here, it sounds like we need to be pulling that in for 2020, at least in the beginning of the year. Can you give us a sense on what you would be comfortable with if people have built in a placeholder? And then third, as you see these elongated decision cycles on M&A cash is building. So are you more comfortable with us leaving that cash on the balance sheet or would you be comfortable with maybe assuming some accelerated repurchase activity as you have those unnecessary balances that start to build? Thanks very much.
Mark Guinan: Yes, so let me go back to our capital deployment strategy. So as we’ve shared, we’re going to do M&A where it’s value accretive to our shareholders, there’s a clear path. We’re not going to do an M&A just to meet some outlooks that we gave. But with that said, we’re very confident in that 2% CAGR. So we never include unexecuted M&A in our guidance. So just because we at this point are implying a low level of M&A either in Q4 or early in the next year, doesn’t mean that we might not be close to something, but that’s just not in our practice. So we don’t actually include M&A in our guidance until we have a signed contract, and so on. So we’re very confident in that 2% CAGR. If you look at what we’ve done, last year and what we’re applying this year we’re going to be well north of that 2% after two years. We’re highly confident that in the next two years to complete that four year CAGR. We’re going to be at that level if not beat it, because there is a lot of interest. As Steve shared and as we’ve talked about these deals have just taken a while it doesn’t mean they have fallen by the wayside, we’re still working on the same deals that we thought we’d would have gotten done several months ago. But we’re very optimistic some of these are going to get completed. And I’m not going to give you any guidance for 2020. What I’m comfortable with obviously we’ll give guidance in late January for the year. I’ll talk about the organic M&A mix and then at that point if we have some additional deals that have closed in the interim those will be included. But otherwise we don’t typically do that – include that in our guidance.
Operator: Our last question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Stephen.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, how are you?
Steve Rusckowski: Good.
Stephen Baxter: I want to follow-up on the patient concessions question. So I’m glad you mentioned the Kaiser report. I was flipping through it and it looks like we’re seeing a fairly similar trend in this year’s report. As discussed at the Investor Day last year in terms of high deductible enrollment, not really increasing that much, but deductibles continuing to march upwards at a similar clip. So I was hoping you could clarify a little bit of what you’re seeing in 2019 relative to 2018 in terms of where in the ecosystem you’re seeing improvement in collections and your level of visibility into that versus this time last year. And then finally in terms of quantification, would you be able to give us a sense of what the collections of improvement has contributed to this year’s growth? Is it reasonable to think about it as offsetting the United out-of-network impact or should we be thinking about something less than that? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so at this point we share where our sources of revenue are. And so at this point, patient responsibility is not grown significantly year-over-year. So despite what the Kaiser report is talking about in terms of increased deduction, this year it’s not impacted us per se year-over-year. One of the things we did in response to some of the surprise we had last year was we shortened our timeframe. So the way we do our revenue recognition, we’re looking at more recent trends that we use to have a longer term trend that worked for us for years, and years and years. So we’re looking at a lot more recent, which would allow us to not have surprises like we had last year. So we’ve been on top of this. We’re very comfortable with what we’ve been accruing. We’re very comfortable with our cash collections. We have a very robust process. And as we look at that we’ve done better on patient concessions, partially because last year was a particularly poor year for some of the reasons I shared earlier, but part of it is we continue to roll out the tools and partner with Optum, our partner around doing things like offering credit card collections upfront.  We support that with our real-time estimation tool, where if you come into our patient service center, you go to an office where we have an in-office lobotomist. We can tell you on the spot whether the test is covered or not and importantly what your responsibility will be based on that coverage decision and then have an opportunity to say and how would you like to pay for the upfront like most of healthcare has done. So we’re collecting more of our cash up front that makes a significant difference in the overall collectability. We’ve also seen an improvement in denials. So some of the things we talked about last year, especially in the PBM space where we’re surprised by a couple of major payers, I will tell you as I shared earlier, the payers in general continue to throw us curve balls, we’re always having to deal with new policy changes, new opportunities for them to deny, but we cleaned up some of the things last year that were more significant. So we’ve reduced our overall denials in a couple of key test periods. That’s helpful. We’ve also shared in the past that we continue to get some preferential treatment from a couple of payers where they put in pre-authorization requirements for certain tests and they actually wave that for a couple of labs, including us because they know we do things, right. We don’t do excessive testing, we partner with them on what clinically appropriate panels are and approach to testing are. So that not only reduces our denial rate because pre-auth is great challenges for the labs, but it also makes us advantageous for the prescriber because they don’t have to worry about pre-auth based on the work to us. So all of those things together are actually helping revenue growth, and they’re helping our overall margin and part of our Invigorate is on the top line. It’s not all on costs, some of it is actually getting paid for more of the work we do as Jim Davis has said at multiple Investor Days. So we’re seeing good positive improvement in that space.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call.At the request of the Company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of this call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.Now, I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods exclude amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projection including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I’ll discuss the second quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then, Mark will provide more detail on the results.Our volume growth accelerated in the second quarter and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our expanded network access continued to accelerate volume growth and our strategy to drive operational excellence improved efficiency. Both have helped to offset the significant reimbursement pressures we are experiencing this year.For the second quarter, we grew revenues despite significant reimbursement pressure; reported EPS was $1.51, down about 4% from the same period of 2018; adjusted EPS was $1.73, down about 1%; volume growth remained very strong at 4.4% as the expected volume continued to accelerate in the second quarter. Year-to-date, volume growth is now at 4%.Now, let me briefly update you on three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace. They are PAMA, our expanded network access, increased consumerization of health care. First, PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. Our Medicare rates in the first half of 2019 were down by 10% from the prior year, which is in line with our expectation. The next data reporting period remains scheduled for the first quarter of next year. However, we are encouraged by the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act or LAB Act introduced in the House last month.The LAB Act would be the first step towards ensuring clinical laboratory service rates under PAMA are sustainable and Medicare beneficiaries have adequate access to crucial laboratory services. By delaying the next round of PAMA data reporting by one year, the Lab Act will provide all applicable laboratories with additional time to report private payor data. A second provision in the Lab Act would require a neutral third party to produce recommendations to Congress and how to improve the PAMA data collection and rate setting process.The second structural change affecting our industry is our expanded network access, and PAMA is becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend.We're partnering with UnitedHealthcare to reduce access cost created by other network labs, the further value to our customers and members. On July 1st, we became the UnitedHealthcare preferred lab network provider and have begun an aggressive outreach campaign to physicians and UHC members.Beginning August 1st, providers referring members to out-of-network labs will be able to complete an online approval process. In addition, Anthem has begun to implement its own strategy that lowers laboratory rates to hospital-based providers, aligning them better with the rates currently paid to the independent laboratories. Also, we continue to have conversations with other health plans on value-based care initiatives and PLN like elements. Some of our recent contract extensions contain these features.Finally, we continue to see increased attention on the variation in health care costs. Last month, the White House released the health care executive order designed to bring more transparency to the health care system. As consumers of health care get more information on the disparities in the cost of care, we believe this trend favors high value providers like Quest.Now, turning to our recent progress and our strategy to accelerate growth, which has five elements: Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then, finally, support population health in data analytics and extended care services.Now, let me take you through a few highlights of our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. As I said earlier, we continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. With the exception of Aetna, this growth is occurring across all of our major health plan customers. We recently signed a new professional lab services agreement with Catholic Health Services of Long Island, a large, integrated health care delivery system in New York. Under the agreement, Quest will provide laboratory and supply chain expertise as well as perform laboratory reference testing. We continue to believe hospitals will be increasingly more motivated to work with us under lab strategy as they feel the impact of PAMA and lower commercial reimbursement. And the area of advanced diagnostics, Quest is now participating as a designated laboratory in the National Cancer Institute’s MATCH precision medicine trial. This is the largest of its kind.The trial seeks to provide better outcomes for rare cancer types for which there is no standard treatment. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, with straight to both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, Cardio IQ, and mutual testing. Each of these categories drove strong revenue growth.Our QuestDirect consumer testing business continues to gain popularity. Earlier this month, we launched a new consumer initiative Lyme disease tests. We also drove sequential volume growth in consumer testing in each month in the second quarter.The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. Some examples are using digital technology to enhance the customer experience, drive growth and reduce our carbon footprint. We have begun to eliminate paper documentation for Medicare beneficiaries who have financial responsibility for non-covered services. This has reduced denials and contributed to our invigorated savings.We're also working to help patients follow through when their physician orders a lab test. We started sending reminder emails to patients whose physicians have ordered tests for them electronically. We're now sending text messages that remind them to nearly one third of our patients who scheduled appointment online, which reduces the no-show rate. Both of these initiatives are expected to help reduce the number of lab orders that go unfulfilled.Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve.In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.95 billion, up 1.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew 2% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 4.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.9%.As we said before, not all volume is created equal and we regularly emphasize our strategy to be price disciplined. Recently, we had a few of our capitated contracts open for renewal. These contracts, while profitable in the past, represented large volumes at very low margins. In the competitive contract renewal process, apparently one of our competitors was willing to offer lower rates that were prospectively very unprofitable for us. Therefore, rather than accept the rate cut, we walked away from the business. Walking away had very little top and bottom line impact, but did create a 70 basis-point headwind volume to our organic volume growth and will do so throughout the balance of the year. We believe this is important for you to understand as you assess our relative volume performance. Despite that headwind, organic volume growth accelerated in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations.Revenue per requisition declined by 2.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.3% in the second quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts.Reported operating income was $307 million or 15.7% of revenues compared to $305 million or 15.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $352 million or 18% of revenues compared to $362 million or 18.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions, largely offset by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives.Reported EPS was a $1.51 in the quarter compared to $1.57 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.73, down approximately 1% from $1.75 last year. Cash provided by operations was $596 million year-to-date versus $503 million last year. And capital expenditures were $132 million year-to-date compared to $151 million a year ago.Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2019 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year; reported EPS is expected to be greater than $5.29 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40; cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.Before closing, I would like to review a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019.First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year due to PAMA, our new in-network health plan contracts in 2019, and the modest reimbursement pressure we typically experience each year from other sources. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as they have through the first half of the year. Third, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019, due to an easier comparison.I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark.To summarize, our growth accelerated in the second quarter due to our expanded network access, and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our strong volume growth combined with our strategy to drive operational excellence enabled us to help offset the significant reimbursement pressures we're experiencing this year. We're excited to be back for being a new Preferred Lab Network status, with UnitedHealthcare, and the opportunities to extend this approach through other players in the marketplace are with us. And then, finally, we believe we're well-positioned to meet our commitments in 2019.Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe help on how volume progressed through the quarter, if you're still seeing a build sort of month to month there, if it has stabilized? And then, I just wanted to kind of clarify what you said around sort of the capitated contract that you lost? Is that a regional or a national contract? And then, just help us on kind of the timing on when it happened? And just broader thoughts, obviously, there's a lot of discussion around the open network approach and sort of structural changes there. So, this goes sort of against that tide. So, maybe flush that out a bit for us. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, Ralph. So, because we have these artificial conventions called fiscal years, months, quarters, et cetera, there is going to be some noise. So, if you look at our volumes throughout the quarter, they didn't accelerate each month because of the calendar. However, when you look at -- there is something else to look at, which requisitions per day on an apples to apples basis, they did absolutely continue to grow throughout the quarter. And as I noted in my closing comments, that is our expectation for the balance of the year. So, throughout each month, the beginning of the year, in the first quarter, we saw accelerate volume growth; and then throughout the second quarter when you look at an apples and apples comparison, absolutely, we continue to strengthen, despite that 70 basis-point headwind. The headwind itself was actually a handful of regional capitated contracts, they were exclusively capitated. There was no fee [ph] for service element in those contracts. And as said, they were very large volumes and low margins. And they started feathering in beginning of the year, really fully hit us largely in the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Adam Noble: Hey, guys. Great. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to see if you could size, in the second quarter, what the benefit to the organic volumes was from managed care access versus just general market growth? And did you expect to have further penetration of those contracts in the back half?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Let me start and then I’ll pass it to Mark. First of all, we continue to talk about we’re always looking at the marketplace and trying to understand what's going in the marketplace. And with all our measurements and metrics that we have, and we've talked about for many years now the same store analysis, we still believe the market is stable. We see stable volumes in our physician accounts and also our hospital business seems to be stable versus the prior year. So, Mark, can you add some color beyond that?
Mark Guinan: So, it’s hard to tease out specifically. I think, to Steve’s point, we don’t think the market has been accelerating in terms of its growth. So, we say market access, if you're asking specifically around United versus more generally, as we shared in the prepared remarks other than Aetna, we’re obviously -- we had a major competitor who entered that contract. We were the sole national. And we’re growing at every single major health plan. So, in terms of market access, it’s not just United. Obliviously, it just makes us more competitive; it enables us to win the office. And so, therefore, we’re seeing growth across the board, not just limited to United or Horizon.
Adam Noble: Got you. If I could just sneak in one more, just any update around the M&A pipeline. Neither you or your main competitor announced any acquisitions year-to-date. Is that a more function of a elongated conversion time line or are you seeing any change to the size or nature of the pipeline?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, you saw in our results that we inched up a little bit Q2 versus Q1 in terms of the amount of our revenue from some acquisitions. So, we're feathering in some of the acquisitions and they are delivering well. Second is, as we said before and we’ll continue to say and our funnel remains strong. We have a number that support our ambition to be close to 2% this year and into future. So, we keep on working on that. And just what I said in my remarks, the pressures that we see are now becoming real and becoming more visible. And those pressures are with PAMA cuts, some of that does extend itself, particularly for hospital outreach businesses and for Medicare rates, and then the commercial changes that I talked about in my prepared remarks are clearly going to impact the hospital marketplace and the independent lab marketplace. And so because of that we continue to have a lot of conversations around integrated delivery systems, lab strategies. And you again saw that we announced this new deal with Catholic Health systems out of Long Island, which is another supporting proof point that we continue to advance our strategy in that front. And the pipeline will be there to support our strategy, as we indicated.
Mark Guinan: As Steve highlighted and as you noted, we did the transaction in the second quarter. As Steve commented, we did get more growth from the M&A, we closed a deal, regional acquisition, Boyce and Bynum in the first quarter. So, obviously, we’ve got the first full quarter of growth from that in Q2. And I would say, there is no attitudinal change in terms of people’s view around potentially getting out of outreach, hospital customers. And certainly, some of the regional labs are feeling the PAMA pain. I think, the interesting dynamic that we’ve seen has been actually more of the conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. So, it’s not just about outreach but actually about doing a PLS deal, doing a reference deal and potentially selling the outreach, like we did with PeaceHealth last year, and that’s a positive. But on the other side, those take longer. And an outreach deal can be done much more quickly. So, that dynamic has emerged a little bit over last year, so, which adds a little bit to the timeframe to get these transactions completed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.
Ross Muken: On the cost side, I mean, it seems like pretty strong sequential OpEx management. I know that you called out in Q1 it’s a pull forward. But, give us a little color, it looks like restructuring tick up a bit, your depreciation came down, how you are tracking on your cost plan and sort of some of the realization of the main program versus some of the other timing elements that played out.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, I’ll start again and Mark will follow. We continue to execute our plan for 2019. We indicated in our first quarter that we have planned for a number of restructuring efforts to start to kick in, start to kick in, in the second quarter. That will continue in the back half of the year. So, we feel good about that. So, we think we have our handles on the levers of cost in the right way. And then, second, Ross, is we continue to drive our operational excellence program. I did say in my remark, it’s 3% of our cost saves, and I'll remind everyone, that's about $200 million. And we continue to yield good results from that. We continue to see good productivity across the board. And yes, that's expense areas but also in cost of sales. And we will continue that into 2020 or 2021. So, Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Ross, I thank you for reminding everyone. There were really the two drivers, if you look into Q2 versus Q1. One was the investments that we did at the beginning of our new access in terms of some marketing, adding some commercial resources, et cetera. Certainly, we haven't stepped back on the commercial resource. We have stepped back on some of the marketing campaign information. There were also some things that were expensive because we were betting on the commanding [ph] patient service centers, adding some logistics, assuming the volume would come, making sure we were in position. Now, that volume is coming, it just became kind of the classic typical cost of sale. So, it’s not incremental expense. And then, the other key driver was the restructuring that we completed at the end of the first quarter, which had taken out, on a run rate basis, a substantial amount of expense. That will continue throughout the balance of the year and going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: I wanted to try to understand the sequential improvement in the decline of revenue per requisition. So, obviously, PAMA is a known quantity at this point. So, I was wondering if you could update us on some of the other moving pieces there, whether it's commercial pricing or bad debt. I guess, the other potential is, maybe this capitated contract, you just got -- had some kind of impact. Any color you can give there is very helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, why don’t you take him through the math?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, typically, in terms of commercial pricing, typically those contracts run on the calendar year. There's been a couple of exceptions where we've done things in the midyear. So, there really wasn't anything in terms of commercial price changes between Q1 and Q2, nor, as you know, is there anything different than PAMA? So, this was really driven by mix. Some of it was some test mix as have some seasonality that can drive things up or down in the rev per req. But as we’ve noted, that doesn't always necessarily directionally align with profitability, even though it does drive changes in rev per req. And then, of course, losing some of the capitated revenue certainly is a lift from a mixed perspective. And then, finally, PLS is a driver as well. Because as we shared in the past, those tend to be more basic requisitions, got a lot of complex testing, and, certainly as the PLS grows, business grows disproportionately; to the rest of the business it can add or put a drag on our revenue per req.And then finally, patient concessions. When you look at the patient concession rate in the second quarter versus the first quarter, it was improved. And, a lot of that is really the result of the efforts that we've had to really improve the collectability of a lot of the tools that we put in place at our patient service centers with our real time adjudication to give people that cost upfront, the ability to collect the credit card as well as really working hard with our partner Optum to get better information on pensions, do a better job of presenting the bill and overall collecting at a higher rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Ann Hynes: So, in your prepared remarks, you did talk about all the payers initiatives, what they are doing on the PLN side, you specifically mentioned them and some recent contracts include some PLN aspects. Can you just go to more detail on what you are talking about? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Well, first of all, let’s go back to the opportunity this year. The biggest opportunity is best to access -- health insurance access we have for over a decade. And the PLN is going to be nice to have and it will provide some more momentum, and we believe it’s a nice lever for us. And yes, we talk a lot about the effect that will have with United. But as we talked about, we're having a number of conversations with other payers. And then, finally is some of the new contract extensions that we already have signed include some of the elements that we will talk about.United will be releasing more and more as we go and they will provide details. As I did mention in my remarks, if you are out of network, it’s going to require more authorization to allow that to happen. So, that’s one point. Second is what we’ve said in the past is there clearly will be a benefit design change, so less out of pocket cost for consumers. And then, third, there will be physician incentives. So, when you think about what's going to be the big element, it’s all around benefit design, less out of pocket cost for consumes, physicians being managed to drive towards that preferred lab network and then finally is really making sure there is no leakage to other network. And it will be stronger than ever with United and we see a lot of momentum with other payers as well.So, more to come on that, Ann. But, we're off and running and working this hard, and we do believe it’s going to be an additional lever. We don’t let it overshadow that the biggest opportunities were back in network. And what I also said in my remarks, yes we had good growth obviously from United but all our major health plans grew with the exception of that network, we actually did expect the modest decline which we saw.
Mark Guinan: So, just to add, Ann, to Steve’s point that a lot of the benefits of the PLN type elements is still in front of us. So, it hasn’t driven the volume growth to this point, it’s an enabler to continue to drive. So, what are some of those things and it’s going to be different by payer type. But these are concepts that we’ve talked about and various payers have embraced some of these or are all of these to a certain extent. A lot of them are rooted in us getting additional payment or a bonus payment what have you as we’ve shown the ability to scale work to better value away from higher cost providers.So, we’ve gotten that in a couple of contracts recently where we have a metric in a way of showing that as they save money, as their members save money that we get a piece of that. And so, we’re aligning those incentives. Number one is around treatment of preauthorization, which is a huge driver for denial. So, and a couple of payers we’ve gotten -- as our chief competitors and some others, the lab that have shown themselves to be high quality, actually differentiate themselves positively from a service perspective and other things around panels and how conduct themselves. We’ve actually gotten the status where they wave the preauthorization. So, it's an advantage for us from a physician ordering perspective that payers, as we know, if you send the work to these, following labs that who are going to be okay with it. So, therefore, you don't require a preauth. So, that's another element that we've gotten in some of our contracts.Steve mentioned some of the zero out of pocket, and some of the payers are coming up with products that they are offering, but obviously got market. We’ll see the adoption rate and then some other payers have voiced an interest in going heavily in that kind of plan benefit design. So, again, it's not as if there's a one size fits all. That's why we talk about these being in elements in some of the other payers. And then, finally, there is a lot of interest in kind of sharing we’ll call it the win fail game from our outreach acquisition. So, when we buy hospital outreach, obviously those commercial rates immediately go to our negotiated rates, which is a huge savings for patients, huge savings for the payer and the notion that, hey, this is good for all stakeholders, and we should share some of that value.So, those are a couple of details that certainly have gotten a lot of traction with the payers. And as Steve pointed out, that is in front of us. So, when I say in front of us, we've gotten those in some of the contracts but obviously, we have to perform and we have to earn those. And then, those are upside going ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. I'm just wondering if you can maybe just give us an update on your consumer retail strategy. I didn't hear anything in the prepared comments this morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. It’s one of our strategies for growth. And several parts of being what’s consumer diagnostic information service provider, we have talked about in the past, just to remind everyone, we have really digitized and brought our patient experiences to today’s world. And so, when you look into a Quest patient service center, it will remind everyone of the other experiences they have in their other experiences as a consumer and as a health care experience. So, a lot of progress there.Second is we continue to make progress on the tools and the access and information. So, MyQuest app, which is our smartphone app, has continued to expand its registration, and continued to expand the capability so you can schedule appointment online, you can see wait times at patient service centers, you obviously get your results. And we now have over 7 million registered users, which is remarkable.And there is a last piece of this, which is your specific question, is the physical presence we think is quite important. So, we have continued to manage our retail strategy and move our patients service centers to a more retail setting over time. Right now, we have roughly 200ish patient service centers between our Safeway relationship and Walmart. Walmart is about 70 of that. And we continue to evaluate the best path forward to eventually have about 50% of our 2,200 patient service centers in more retail like settings.Now, what I’ll also share is we have said that roughly 25%, let’s call it, 500 of our current patient service centers are more retail like, not all with retailers, but as we evolve over time, with our current retail relationships and with possible others, that number will grow to be about half of our fleet of patient service centers. And our experience in those is quite good. We believe that the patient obviously experience better with much more consumer experience, our employees, there is -- a lot of us like it better. We can consolidate our operations at the fewer sites. And the patient have access. They walk in, they can walk around with the pager, as they can do some shopping, they can eat after they’ve been fasting. So, overall, m our perspective it’s quite good. And then, our relationship with retailers is good as well because they benefit from that store traffic. So, we feel positive about the response and results so far and we will continue to drive it.
Mark Guinan: The only thing I would Lisa is that there is some always some outliers. But if you look at on average, our retail draw sites continue to increase the amount of activity. We had the highest average amount of draws in our Walmart sites in June that we’ve had since we started this. So, we're very happy with the amount of traffic we're getting, we’re feeling really good about the presence. And of course, our volume is growing. So, there is things that are probably driving it. So, part of it is awareness. People are starting to figure out, we’ve got these draw sites in Walmart and getting comfortable going there, and we’d expect that to continue over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ellich: Steve, in your prepared remarks, you comment about Anthem shifting hospital base rates to independent lab rates. We saw something, I think at Lab Economics that that was shifted for pathology. Can you give little bit more color, is this for all of the tests that are being done in hospitals or just pathology? And then, are you seeing other commercial payers follow this, doing something similar, then what will that do for your hospital outreach and PLS deals?
Steve Rusckowski: So, I would just say, as an overarching comment and it’s embedded in our introductory remarks that we have PAMA, and PAMA to some extent is independent of what's happening on the commercial side. But, we now continue to see pressure from commercial payers on hospital outreach. So, yes, we mentioned Anthem but I will also share that there is pressure from other payers, typically with those that we work with, to push down the rates for all the ancillary services and obviously that includes labs, that includes radiology and includes other ancillary services that are provided by the hospital. And, Kevin, two parts to this. One is just in general to move more of the volume to most -- the highest value reach provider like ourselves in lab, but second is because we add a cost to consumers. And the consumers, given the high percentage of corresponsive health plans that have high deductibles and high out of pocket costs for these expensive hospital based services, the payers are looking at more aggressive strategies to normalize the rates more.So, yes, we call that Anthem is proactively having a strategy but we see this in many other places with many other commercial payers that are pushing back on what they’ve done in the past with ancillary services in general but specific to lab.
Mark Guinan: So, Kevin, I would encourage you to ask Anthem directly. There is a -- I don’t know, they’ve led a couple of places with pathology. There is a publically available document, which we’re referencing. And as you might imagine, before we said anything, we checked with them to make sure they were comfortable with the statement that we are attributed to. For more detail, I would encourage you to ask Anthem about the schedule and how broadly they're doing it and so on. But, there is something they've published and put out in the public domain.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. And part B of this, Kevin, I mentioned in my remarks, the movement across the country towards more price transparency. As you know there is wide variation in our marketplace with ourselves having what we believe the best value proposition on the planet, great quality, great service at some of the lowest prices. And in that regard, actually there was a story today in the journal, which speaks to a number of the payers, providing apps and services, if you will, to provide visibility to consumers to do a better job of shopping. And they called out Anthem, as we did, but others including Humana and UnitedHealthcare that are working proactively as by way of another example, to help consumers manage their costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Good morning. Just given some of the recent progress in terms of the commercial contracting that you talked about, I was wondering if you could give us some line of sight into how you think commercial unit pricing is shaking out for 2020, and just how that compares to the long-term guidance that you laid out at the Investor Day later year.
Steve Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark Guinan: So, I’m sure you appreciate, Jack, I'm not going to speak to 2020. We're in very good shape in terms of where we stand with the commercial payers and the need to extend contracts. So, there's no surprises that anyone should expect, we're in great shape. And around the pricing, I mean, obviously, those prices already set those contracts. Really, some of those incentive payments that I referenced, those have to be determined, as we as we perform. So those could be some upside. However, if you recall, I gave you a pretty broad range on the revenue CAGR. So, what I would tell you is that within those scenarios, between the low end and the high end, we've contemplated all the different kind of outcomes that might happen, including, obviously, how quickly we get our fair share of some of the new network access contracts, and then how quickly and to what extent we earn some of those potential incentive payments. So, I would say everything within the multiyear outlook that I provided has been reasonably contemplated. And that's why we give a broad range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. Question for Mark. Hello. I just wanted to clarify your organic volume growth expectations in the second half of the year. So, you said that volume should gradually increase as you progress through the year. The comps do get tougher. So, are you expecting organic volume growth in the back half of the year to be higher than this kind of rounding to 3ish percent you've delivered in the first half of the year?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, we absolutely expect the revenue, despite any sort of comps -- I'm sorry, the volume, to increase on an organic basis. So, it may not happen every week, may not happen every day, every month. But when we look at Q3 and Q4, we expect to continue to see improvements versus the second quarter in our year-over-year organic volume.
Operator: Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Donald Hooker: So, I just wanted to ask maybe a question on the PLS business. I think, in the past you guys have targeted some good -- some optimistic outlook -- an optimistic outlook. So, I think you talked about 50 basis points of revenue growth and going forward or something, a revenue growth tailwind going forward from just PLS deals. Are you on track with these deals? It looks like there’s been a couple. I’m not sure if there have been others that you haven’t announced but in terms of trying to size these deals and sort of put you on a trajectory with PLS, can you kind of reiterate that or...
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, as we shared with you our five strategies, one of which is the proactively conversations with integrated delivery systems on their lab strategy, and also the access to health care as well within geographies where we had issues with not having good access with some of their patients. So, this continues to be a nice growth driver for us. We announced the Catholic Health Systems deal in Long Island. We did announce some other relationships last year and they studied in and built throughout 2019. And I’ll just close with say the funnel continues to build. In the past, we shared where we’re going and we have conversation where the lab strategy. It starts with how we can make them more efficient and this is what we call professional lab services or PLS, and this is their in-patient hospital lab and it’s a cost matter. So, we could save them anywhere from 10% to 20% of their costs. So, that’s an opportunity.Second, as we get into that, we look at them to rationalize and to become more efficient in their sophisticated reference testing that we said out. That’s another opportunity. And then, the third piece, it’s very unusual not to have this conversation. We didn’t have a conversation about their outreach where they are in the commercial marketplace with us and does it make a sense for us to them to continue to be in it or should we buy their business. So, those discussions continue to progress. We have a bigger funnel than ever. We’ve backed out the United States. We know all the integrated delivery systems with big outreach businesses, we know those that have substantial number of beds in their cost centers and that continues to be a nice growth driver for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Steve, maybe just on the contracts you walked away from. Can you just provide some more color there? It’s a bit surprising to hear competitors are once again being aggressive on price, I still hear there is a bit of a low there. Given the PAMA backdrop the industry seems to realize price discipline is best way to fan that off. So, maybe just more context on what you’re seeing, what would lead these other labs to be price competitive, given this backdrop?
Mark Guinan: Great question, yes, they are competitors. So, it’s not something we can speak to. Obviously, we control our own towards pricing. We’ve been pretty vocal and consistent that we feel our price is already really good. There is an awful lot of competitors in this marketplace that have prices that are multiple of our price, and we are an excellent value. There was no need for Quest to offer lower price. So in terms of other people's motivation to drop price further in some instances, that’s a question you will need to put to them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Ricky, we can't hear you.
Alexa Desai: Hi. Sorry. This is Alexa on for Ricky. Can you hear me?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes.
Alexa Desai: Okay. Thanks. Ihad a little line trouble there. I wanted to come back to your expectations for the second half of the year. You beat the quarter but maintained guidance, which sort of implies the lower second half earnings than what the Street is currently modeling. Are there any headwinds you feel the Street isn't factoring into the back half of the year? Can you just give us a sense of the puts and takes here, and what the sources of upside to the guide could be?
Steve Rusckowski: Let me just start and then Mark will give details. What we showed in the first half is we've delivered on what we set for expectations that we wanted to show the moment to build throughout the first half of 2019 that we did. So, we're pleased with the results in the first half. Second is, we’re midway through the year. And we thought it was prudent at this point to maintain our outlook. I’m not going to ahead of ourselves, but what Mark said earlier is and what we’ve said about this year but also in general about the growth opportunities in front of us, it will continue to build throughout 2019, but this is not just a build for 2019. It will conclude the build in 2020, 2021. So, Mark little more color around the rest of the year?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, we are not in any way, influenced by the Street’s feelings into the back half. What we do when we give guidance is really what we think our shareholders and stakeholders should understand from our perspective. So, when you look at the first half, we're very pleased with our results. We feel like we're on track, it's still halfway through the year. Of course, in the back half, we have things that sometimes happened that are beyond our control, like hurricanes and snow in December, and so on. So at this point, we just felt, there wasn't any need since we've given a 4 and not given any certain range. So, there's nothing negative in terms of our signaling for the back half. We are on track to do what we expected, which is to do at least $60.40 starts. We’re obviously feeling good I think as many others with what we've done in the first half. But we'd rather just continue to perform, and then obviously cross our fingers around any sort of weather events and other things that might impact the back half, but certainly nothing operational that we're signaling or that anyone should be concerned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk: So, kind of a multi-part question here, guys. First, I think the answer is no. But, is there any negative effects from Anthem? Second piece is with respect to the capitated contract loss, was that contemplated in the original guidance? And then, lastly, just any comment with respect to genomics business, given that the principal supplier into that industry had obviously cited some challenges in that space couple weeks ago? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: So, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your question Your question Bill on Anthem.
Steve Rusckowski: First part.
Bill Quirk: Yes. The first part of the Anthem question was just, I think the impact here was predominantly for hospitals. I just want to confirm, guys, that you're not seeing any negative effects from some of the Anthem reimbursement changes that they're implementing.
Mark Guinan: No. We have a contract -- multiple contracts with Anthem. We contract with them regionally that we have a negotiated price and so on. And certainly, we are not in the ZIP code of the hospitals that they are now starting to say need to be rationalized. So, this is really a movement to get everyone -- it's not targeting anyone specifically, except for the outliers to be more in a more consistent rate. So, we feel we’re already in that in that ZIP code. And certainly there's going to be no changes in the current timeframe because we have contracts with Anthem. On the capitated, we really don't give guidance on volume. So, was this a possibility that we contemplate it? Yes, certainly. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it’s had minimal impact to our revenue, and certainly no impact to our bottom line. So, really, it's more of a volume effect. And we try to encourage our stakeholders to not -- to pay quite as much attention to volume because of very reason. So, we thought given the magnitude of this change we’re going to make sure that you understood, there was a big volume shift from us to others or to another direct headwind but really no financial or economic negativity to us, just volume.
Steve Rusckowski: The last part, Bill, I had hard time hearing that as well.
Bill Quirk: Just a comment, Steve, on your outlook for the consumer genomics business, given one of the principal suppliers a couple of weeks ago.
Steve Rusckowski: Got you. Thank you. As you know, we have relationship with the Ancestry and that’s a good relationship and continues to build. No material effect on our -- at our growth plus or minus. So, I would just say in general fairly stable. Second is I did remark about our consumer testing business, which for us is a nice platform that is growing nicely and we're very pleased with the pick-up around our general diagnostic testing. And I mentioned that we just introduced a new line with these tests. But we're going to use that as well as a platform for consumer genetics in the future. So, more to come. But overall, stable environment as we see it. As you know we're not the only provider of the Ancestry at this time. And it’s not a big piece of our revenue. So, stable business for us at this point and still good opportunity in front of us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Could you talk a little bit about the esoteric testing business and just sort of volume and mix trends within that and sort of how that’s impacting revenue per requisition, just pricing getting better, reimbursement stable in that, just any additional color would be great.
Steve Rusckowski: First of all, the term esoteric is an industry term. We have defined our genetic and molecular as being what we call advanced diagnostics, and we don’t break out specially that business and provide color. But in general, what we’ve said in the past, it’s a business and an opportunity that’s been growing mid single digits, and we want to continue to accelerate it and it’s active part of our strategy. And within the quarter we felt good about the progress we made in that business in a number of fronts. We had some good growth and some portions of women's health. And in addition to that we define it esoteric. Esoteric, it typically includes a toxicology presence. Prescription drug monitoring continues to be a nice, big growing business for us. We're pleased with the progress and the quarter as well. And just in general, I think, our esoteric or more sophisticated testing, we had good year-on-year compressions, better than last year in the hospital presence, that’s not all esoteric but in general a lot of it is. And then, as we pull more growth in a general diagnostics business, it typically will also pull some of advanced diagnostics or esoteric business as well. So, overall, as we raise the tide, it’s going to help all the boats in the harbor, including advanced or esoteric as well as general diagnostics.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Matt Larew: Obviously, PAMA was an initial catalyst for hospitals and health systems thinking about the feature of their lab business. But it sounds like the preferred lab network, both specifically with United and then more broadly as payers are being more aggressive with the way you think about laboratory testing may actually be perhaps a more dramatic catalyst. I wonder if you could just discuss the conversations you're having with hospitals and health systems be it for outright M&A or PLS arrangements. And how payer behavior has started to change those conversations?
Steve Rusckowski: First of all, recall, we've been talking about three changes in the marketplace, the PAMA effect, and could argue, it really just got started within 2018. And because of some of the nuances of how payment works, it was somewhat muted related to some of the offsets to the fee reduction, which grew about 10%. So, the first year, ‘19 is the second year, is a full year, no muting any of the effects, acts and then another effect in 2020. So, that is starting to become more visible in hospital outreach businesses, and administrations of hospitals are becoming more aware of that.And the second part of that is it will spill over and has already spilled over to Medicaid. Typically Medicaid in all states is lower than Medicare. And then, finally, as I talked earlier, a lot of the commercial payers are pushing back on, wide discrepancy of health care costs, specifically in our space, in laboratory, wide variations where hospital rates could be 2 to 10 times higher than our rates. And the last piece is the reason why they're pushing on this is because consumers are paying for more and more health care every day, employers are asking questions about it and it’s getting visibility in Washington.So, those three changes in the marketplace, they're getting a lot of visibility for -- from the administration of any and it’s great delivery system. And then second is small regional operators clearly see a different environment going forward.But sometimes we're asked question what inning we're in, okay, in anything we do. I would say, in this front, for those three structural changes, we're still in the early innings, but it’s building momentum as we get into the middle of the game. So, I think we're now beyond the start, and we're starting to get a lot more visibility to it. And there's going to be a lot more change in 2020 and that can be affecting decisions of whether hospitals stay the business or whether regionals continue to operate as the operator consider their options and considering selling the business. And it is part of our strategy to be a consolidator in a smart way since we are the leader.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Hey. Thanks very much. Most of my topics were covered. But on these capitated contracts, we know from past filings that they were in total representing about 11% of volume and 3% of your revenue. Were the contracts that you specifically walked away from the low end of a capitated contract because you're seeing absolutely no impact on revenue? So, I'm just trying to understand -- typically capitated contract is a quarter of your average profitability. So, were these the low end of that range or is there perhaps some slight impact from this change? Thanks very much.
Mark Guinan: So, they were definitely low margin, as I referenced. We've actually maintained some of the work at a higher rate. So, there's an offset to the lost OM, because in the particular states that this took place, they're obligated to pay us for a subset of test, even if we're not in contract, and they're obligated to pay us at a rate that’s of much higher. So, therefore, you can get that detail in the prepared remarks. But that's why it is really very little, if any OM impact. That’s a partial offset to the revenue, not a 100% because it’s lower volume, less revenue, even though at a much higher rev per req but not enough to compensate in total. So, it’s within certainly rounding overall annual revenue, it’s not a huge number with that offset and on an OM basis, it’s really had no impact because we continue to get paid for some of the work that we’ve maintained.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Mark Massaro: I wanted to ask about, in regards to your consumer initiatives, QuestDirect is certainly one of the initiatives. I know it seems fairly early and other lab providers are doing similar pilots. But can you just speak to any traction you are getting there? Maybe can you help us think about whether or not that has moved the needle in terms of actual orders coming from new types of individuals? And then, my second question is on the Clinical Trials Connect program. Also seems like it’s early days but can you speak to any wins there that gives you confidence that this can grow in the future?
Steve Rusckowski: So, first of all, on direct-to-consumer, we’ve been at this for a while. We’ve actually started to test the water. We built a business with the relationship with the New York Football Giants and we call it Sports Diagnostics, and really put our toe in the water of understanding very specific segments, how we can market a product directly to consumers, how we can fulfill that order because it’s a different order fulfillment change resulted. So, we had to build some capability years ago to do that.And then, second is we actually tested the waters on our general diagnostics business is the state of Arizona several years ago. We have a joint venture partner with Banner Health. And as you recall, one of our competitors, given in that state they passed legislation where consumers no longer needed a physician order to order laboratory test. And so, we actually priced out about 100 tests and found out in fact in Arizona there was a market. And so, we took that success and we moved it to Missouri and to Colorado. And then this past fall, we actually expanded it to 48 continental states. About so, 22 of those states who no longer need a physician order, and that’s what we’ve also done in the other 26 states, is we lit up a self help [ph] network with PWN to provide in order for consumers that they need it. So, we're deeply engaged in this. We worked out some of the things operationally from years ago with all those experiences and we're off and running. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement and sequentially actually month upon month we're seeing some nice volume growth.And there is a segment. Now, this is all private pay. And we price it accordingly for private pay. And there is a segment where people rather cold get some of these tests done without engaging their health care insurance company. So, off and running, and we're pleased with it and show results. The second part of the question had to do with -- Mark, could you remind of the second question?
Shawn Bevec: Mark, are you still there? No. Operator, we’ll end it from there.
Steve Rusckowski: We will take it from there. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of this call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we’ll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, references to adjusted operating income for all periods now excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning, I’ll discuss the first quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results. Well we’re off to a good start in 2019; for the first quarter, we grew revenues despite one less revenue day and significant reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.20, down 5% from the same period of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down 8%. We’re pleased with our revenue and adjusted EPS results given the expectations we shared with you in mid-February. Volume growth was very strong at 3.6%, so Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share and deliver revenue growth. Performance in the quarter reflects volume growth from expanded network access, acquisitions, improving performance in our hospital reference business, and favorable weather. We’ve made progress in the quarter despite significant reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. As we shared before, Quest is poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, PAMA driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. Reimbursement experience in the first quarter is in line with the expected 10% reduction in Medicare rates and we expect a similar reduction in 2020. We also said the impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller, independent, and hospital outreach laboratories. We believe the cuts could potentially eliminate the majority of their profit and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation. Just in this quarter, the nation’s largest nursing home lab operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The company provided clinical laboratory testing services to more than 12,000 facilities in more than 35 states. According to the press reports, PAMA was cited as a major reason for bankruptcy as the Medicare cuts wiped out the company’s slim profits and caused it to cut back services. Second, payers are more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend, which supports our plan to gain share. This is clearly evidenced by the opening of major health plan contracts at the large national laboratories, which provides the best value and quality for patients, physicians, and payers. We’re very pleased to be named a UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network provider effective July 1, 2019, meeting exceptional criteria for access, costs, data, quality, and service. Quest and our AmeriPath subsidiary were two of only seven labs selected to participate in the Preferred Lab Network. Finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare costs than the employers and their employees, the country’s largest payers. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find high quality and service providers with low prices like Quest Diagnostics. More and more we’re seeing evidence of increasing price transparency in the lab marketplace. Massachusetts has been a leader in price transparency by launching its own website to help consumers understand the wide variation in healthcare cost. During Governor Charlie Baker’s recent visit to our Marlborough lab, we pledged our continued support to Massachusetts’ efforts to help consumers understand the true cost of care. We are well positioned to benefit from these trends, which will serve as a catalyst for Quest to continue to gain share. Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements: Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategic in-line acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health in data analytics and extended care services. Let me take you through several highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Recall, we shared in our initial guidance that we carried over 1% growth into the year. The nine deals we announced and closed since the beginning of 2018 positioned as well to meet our M&A growth targets in 2019, including our recently completed acquisition of the clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum. Our pipeline remains strong, and we’re having several conversations with health systems evaluating their hospital outreach lab strategy. We delivered strong organic growth through the quarter, thanks to the best access to insured lives this company has had in over a decade. In January, we saw a rise in volume attributable to health plans, where we recently gained access and the year-over-year growth rate accelerated throughout the quarter. We’re working hard to educate a whole new group of physicians on the Quest value proposition, but it does take time. As we said, gaining market share through expanded network access will be a gradual process.  So we’re pleased by the progress we’re making in our access improvement as well as we’re making progress in our hospital reference testing, which reflects our recent PLS relationships and reference testing wins. Trends in our reference testing business has shown improvement relative to last year. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, Cardio IQ, drug monitoring, and hemepath blood cancer testing, all of which showed strong revenue growth for the quarter. QuestDirect, our consumer initiating testing service is being well received by consumers who are looking to take charge of their health. Our offerings are popular across the entire demographic spectrum, with the largest percentage of consumers coming from the 25 to 34-year-olds. Earlier this month, we launched three new STD test packages allowing with consumers to get tested at their discretion. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Construction of our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is well underway. The lab builds on the success of our Lab of the Future at Marlborough, Massachusetts, incorporating innovative uses of building design and automated technology to provide a broad range of advanced diagnostic and information services to more than 40 million people. We expect the lab to be operational in 2021. We also continue to drive increases in productivity. We have rebalanced resources and reduced expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume growth that we see. Productivity gains have enabled us to effectively manage our headcount growth. So here are a few proof points. We’re seeing improved electronic order rates as we increase volume from the expanded network access which improves our lab productivity. We continue to re-enable our enterprise workflow, which has allowed us to reduce the number of specimen pickups and the number of client calls through acquisitions to our call centers. We’ve also driven increases in our supplies efficiency. And then finally, our labor productivity gains have enabled us to reduce our labor cost per acquisition in the first quarter while providing salary increases for our front-line employees. Now I’d like to turn it over to Mark, who will bring you through the financial performance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.89 billion, up 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 0.5% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and favorable weather, partially offset by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 3.6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.4%. Favorable weather in the first quarter provided a tailwind of roughly 50 basis points. However, there was approximately one less revenue day in the quarter that negatively impacted volume growth by roughly 120 basis points. Revenue per acquisition in the first quarter declined by 3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Year price headwinds were consistent with our expectations at approximately 2.5%. This concludes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of slightly less than 120 basis points. Note, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the current lab fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes for Medicaid and then small number of floating rate contracts. Reported operating income was $248 million, a 13.2% of revenues, compared to $272 million or 14.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $286 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was attributable to one less revenue day in the quarter, higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Reported EPS was $1.20 in the quarter, compared to $1.27 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down approximately 8% from $1.52 last year, which is roughly in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. Cash provided by operations was $275 million in the first quarter versus $180 million last year. Capital expenditures were $47 million compared to $73 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2019 as follows. Revenues expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.16 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I’d like to leave with a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019. First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind should be relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as we saw through the first quarter. Third, the Easter and passover holidays falling entirely in April will create a modest year-over-year headwind in the second quarter. Fourth, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 because of an easier comparison. I’ll now turn it back to Steve
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we’re off to a good start in 2019. While our industry faces significant reimbursement pressure. We are pleased with our results in the quarter. We’re driving volume and market share based on being a network of approximately 90% of the commercial insured lives in the United States. We believe we are well positioned to meet our commitments in 2019. With that, we’d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. So, for my one question…
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Dan Leonard: Good morning. Steve, you made the comment that the volume growth accelerated throughout the quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate on the monthly performance, I’m thinking that it will maybe help us as we think about volume growth accelerating throughout the year.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Thank you, Dan. Well, first of all, as we said going into the year, we expect that we’ll have initial pickup in the first month in January given all the work we did in 2018 to get the word out about our access changes, and we did see that. And then also what we said at the beginning of this year is we do expect that it will continue to build, and it continued to build in Q1 so we saw an improvement in February and also in March. But equally, we expected it to continue to gradually build throughout the year, so as we’ve said, this is a nice growth opportunity for us in 2019, but we see an opportunity in 2020 and 2021.
Dan Leonard: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Ross.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Muken: So maybe starting on United, obviously, pretty exciting news yesterday you highlighted in terms of getting selected in their PLN. I guess one, now that this sort of is formalized, I guess, how do you think other payers will look at this given sort of the known savings someone like yourself can kind of drive for consumers, members, plans, all included, given your scale and sort of cost advantage? And then, how would you sort of characterize the conversations you’re having with some of the other Managed Care peers and some of the blues who could probably easily do something similar to what United is doing today?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Thanks, Ross. Well, first of all, we’re excited to be part of the Preferred Lab Network. As we mentioned in our comments, we’re two out of seven. So very tight network and this will start on July 1, however, the word is out. And as you all know, the word was out when we announced that we’re back in network last year. So we’ve had quite a lot of interest from other national payers about what this means to some of the large regionals. And needless to say, we think it’s the beginning of a trend that we would like to continue to see in other relationships that we have. What this means will become more clear as we get into it, but what we indicated clearly there will be incentives for physicians and patients in the benefit designs to move more of the volume through the high-value lab providers like Quest Diagnostics. Second is we need to continue to perform. So, we are high-quality lab, both in service and in quality, we’ll be providing statistics quarterly to demonstrate that. And then finally, we’ll continue to move with the opportunities we see in the marketplace to consolidate the marketplace and pick up share, which will include continuing to work on our hospital strategy, picking up share for some of those hospital outreach labs. So, we think this is a good first step in a trend that will continue. It’s not going to be just with United but other payers will follow.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Ross, if I could just add quickly because I think it’s certainly important. In the past, there were health plans that had preferred providers in the lab space, and obviously in other areas. And a lot of that was generally around price, so who’s willing to give me the lowest price and I’ll call them and provide a preferred provider. In this case, contracts were negotiated separate from this decision that United just made. Obviously, everyone’s prices are determined by individual negotiations. And this is really about evaluating the value that you bring. So yes, price is an important component. But when we looked at the application and, as Steve shared, access, service and quality are the things that drive value. And as we’ve been talking about for a while, we feel we are positively differentiated versus most of the market and here is an acknowledgment by a large payer, obviously, agreeing with that and then getting behind that by naming us as one of those preferred providers so that consumers of our services, both the patient and the physician, will recognize that. Because obviously, it’s hard for them to know and see and compare across the various options that they have. So we’re very excited about this because this is not a price play. This is about the value you’re offering on many parameters, and we are well down the road in conversations with several other nationals on similar concepts and so they recognize as well this is an opportunity to bring better value into the members.
Steve Rusckowski: And Ross, one of the things that I wanted to make clear, just based on some questions that I was receiving last night, is that we are – there’s no additional contracted change or price change for us to be in the Preferred Lab Network. We have contracted rates with United and those are the rates that we’ll live with them in the Preferred Lab Network. So there’s no additional step down. 
Ross Muken: And maybe just quickly as a follow-up, I mean what does this do to the competitive landscape? I mean, you talked about a bankruptcy, obviously, between sort of the PAMA pressures and maybe volumes narrowing to fewer and fewer players on the lab side with yourselves and maybe your largest peer probably benefiting the most. I guess, how do you see this landscape kind of evolving competitively at least among the independents over maybe the next three or five years?
Steve Rusckowski: So Ross, it just comes backs to, we think we have a unique setup in our industry to gain share. PAMA is the big change and it changed the underlying profitability of the industry. When we were at our Investor Day, we talked about roughly half the profit coming out of the industry and whenever you take half the profit out of any industry, you’re going to see consolidation and we’re the market leader and we’re going to consolidate. Second is you do see now with the Preferred Lab Network for United and what Mark just said about other payers following, there will be tighter purchasing with the payers. And then finally, this is driven in part by members pushing back on the high cost of healthcare and the movement to more transparency with much more visibility and wide variation in health care cost. And Quest Diagnostics is really second to none in terms of our quality or service and at very, very competitive prices. So we believe this is a different place at a different time and we’ve gotten an opportunity to pick up share.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one on M&A. Can you give us an update on some of the recent larger acquisitions like Shiel? How that’s trending against your deal model? And then just on the pipeline, can you talk about how that’s trending versus maybe late last year? Are you kind of seeing that long-awaited inflection point in the consolidation pieces on the lab side?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Mark, why don’t you take the Shiel?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Shiel – I don’t know you referenced [indiscernible] since we closed Shiel more than a year ago but we don’t specifically comment on individual deals. But what we have said is that we’re very confident in our ability to integrate acquisitions especially around the core lab space whether its outreach or regional lab like Shiel. So we’re pleased with our progress and certainly, it’s contributing to some of our growth. So this is something we’ve gotten really good at over the last several years. We’ve got it institutionalized in our organization. We’ve got a team that spends time dedicated on these integrations. We got a playbook and we roll out every time that we do one of these deals. And largely what we’re really doing is we’re just moving that volume into our existing infrastructure be in our draw centers or logistics or laboratory. So as we’ve said before, it’s pretty much always a cost play, it’s the easiest one to deliver. So we’re very confident in our ability to deliver those synergies and then importantly, because of all the things we talked about around our service and our quality and the amount of attention we pay to these integrations, we have been successful in maintaining a vast majority of that volume. So we’re confident in what we do going forward based on our ability that we’ve demonstrated over the last couple of years.
Steve Rusckowski: And Patrick, the second part of your question has to do with our funnel and activity and just in general is more interest of particularly, I think, you’re referring to hospitals – hospital outreach laboratories selling their business. If you go back a year ago, what we’ve said is PAMA was announced in the first year of payment cuts and what it says in our travels is that very few hospital CEOs were aware of PAMA back a year ago. That has changed, made more are aware of it, it’s been getting much more visible. What we continue to push in terms of having to think through our – their lab strategy is continue to get traction. And so we’re in active dialogues, as I said in our prepared – my prepared remarks with a number of systems around their lab strategy, which includes outreach. Now you couple PAMA with what you’re hearing about the payers putting pressure on the Preferred Lab Network and as you know, the most significant price differential is typically with hospital outreach labs. So when we have this conversation, clearly you hear about PAMA, it’s certainly – potentially a 30% cut for their Medicare business, which will also see pressure on the payer side. And then thirdly is they are hearing from their physicians that their patients are pushing back on their high out-of-pocket cost. So in general, this is putting more logs on the fire of consolidation and our hospital strategies is in the works of getting more and more opportunities in front of us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi. Good morning. So I have a follow-up question on the United network. Just to clarify, did you factor in any contribution from the preferred network in the second half guidance? And the second part of the question, kind of, like, when we look at all the other labs that are included, most of them seem to be focused on specialty testing. So are there also economic incentives to patients who would opt to come to Quest on their routine side? Just kind of, like, trying to understand the incentives that United is providing consumers to come to Quest over some other regional routine providers.
Mark Guinan: So Ricky, let me just address the guidance and then I’ll turn it back to Steve. As you know, we have a pretty broad range of 1% to 3%. So there’s a lot of different things that come to play in that. So what I would say at this point is in order to meet our guidance, certainly, somewhere in the middle, we’re not counting on significant volume coming from the Preferred Lab Network. Obviously, at this point, we don’t know yet know the details. United has not announced those details. So we’re awaiting that. We’re optimistic and hopeful that it’s going to be something that’s going to have some significant impact. But you naturally expect that would grow and certainly probably more in 2020. We could get some benefit in 2019. But we need to wait until they announce exactly it’s going to work, what those details are and so forth. So we’re not counting on a kind of volume lift in the back half from the Preferred Lab Network.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. If you look at the seven, what we mentioned as two are Quest and that’s Quest in general and then our AmeriPath subsidiary, which is our anatomic pathology business. If we see – you see two from Bio-Reference and so if you look at the list of seven, essentially what you find is two national laboratories broadly and Bio-Reference within reason for, let’s say, the general diagnostics and then all of us for intensive purposes compete in the what we refer to as advanced diagnostics. The specifics of incentives around that are still to be defined by United. And when we have more that we can share with you, we will. But clearly, it will drive at least incentives in place to drive volume from the general diagnostic side as well as the advanced diagnostics side.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. Good morning. So I just wanted an update on some of the operational trends from last year that were issued, maybe bad debt, drugs or abuse and vitamin C testing, it seemed to have stabilized. And also quickly, can you let me know how much of the one less day impacted organic volume growth? What it would have been without that headwind? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Yes. As I shared in, we estimated about 120 basis points of impact from one less day and I also shared, we’re going to – it’s not precise but pretty much picked that up in the third quarter. So there’s the offset for the year. In terms of bad debt, I think you’re referring to patient concessions. Our bad debt actually was slightly up. This year, we had one bankruptcy within our client bill business that impacted our bad debt in the quarter. Certainly not a trend, it’s kind of a one-off. But patient concessions, probably about a 50 basis point headwind. And what we’re really seeing is some of the patient responsibility trends that we saw in the latter half of last year, we’re now carrying it forward with the expectation that, that ratio will continue. So therefore, our expectation would be in the first half we have some headwinds around patient concessions and then assuming that things don’t change dramatically within the marketplace in 2019 that in the back half maybe we get some of that back. So that’s what I would frame the – some of the trends. Around drugs of abuse, we did get some recent news that the national payer that had been denying same day of service were the presumptive and definitive testing and the reimbursement has changed and we haven’t got the definitive date when that’s going to be implemented. But we have got a confirmation writing for them that they’re going to change that. So that was certainly good news. And then in terms of lapping some those changes, we are beyond when they started. So from a year-over-year comparables, they’re behind us. And then the big payer change last year in Q2 on vitamin D, obviously, we’ve lapped that as well now that we’re in the second quarter but it was a headwind in Q1 certainly for us. We’ve also shared that Aetna is going to move to that similar approach for screening of vitamin D. However, with Aetna, there is a difference because we can bill the patient. Whereas with the other payer, we just had to do the test for free, which is just something we’re working on with that payer. But as per the contract, we were not able to revert to a patient bill. So while Aetna certainly were not thrilled that they’re moving to a similar policy, it’s not going to be as much of a headwind as it was with the other payer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Jack.
Mitch Petersen: Thank you. This is actually Mitch Petersen, on for Jack this morning. Just being curious where volumes fell relative to your expectations in the quarter in – both from a share gain perspective but also just from a utilization environment perspective? And in your view, do you think that utilization environment in the first quarter actually picked up relative to 2018?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Well, I’ll start with utilization. As Mark talked about where volumes fit in with what we expected in the quarter, but utilization is stable. As we said in the past, we look at this on a different directions as you all do and from what we can tell, utilization in general is stable and that’s – I would argue for our physician business and not hospital business as well as our hospital business. Mark, volumes relative to what we expected?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So as you know, we had guided to flat to down, we actually grew revenue. So volumes were slightly above our expectations. I would attribute a large part of that to weather. As we’ve talked about in the past, we can’t predict the weather. So we always kind of take an average level of weather and build that into our expectations and into our guidance, and we had 50 basis points of favorable weather this year. So as Steve said, we’re very pleased with volumes. We had expected a significant lift. If you adjust for the one fewer day, even more impressive volume growth, certainly, something we’ve not seen in a long, long time at Quest, especially on the organic side. So meeting our expectations and finally, a little bit better literally because of the weather.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Kevin. Good morning.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning, guys. So kind of just following up there. If we net-net for the weather and the one less day, it looks like underlying organic growth was about 3.1% even though reported was 2.4%. Did I do my math right there, Mark?
Mark Guinan: Close enough, Kevin, yes.
Kevin Ellich: Okay. Good. And then just wanted to see if you can help us quantify how much of the organic growth came from expanded network access to United and BlueCross BlueShield of New Jersey? And then did you see any volume loss from your Aetna business?
Mark Guinan: Sorry. any volume loss from what?
Steve Rusckowski: Aetna.
Kevin Ellich: From Aetna.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So obviously, we’re not going to get into specific payers but the lift didn’t all come from the new access. We certainly have seen growth in some of the other payers really across the board in the regions that are growing as one might expect because as we go in and talk about our broad access, we’re winning accounts. And so those accounts obviously are bringing with them volume from the payers with whom we recently gained access but obviously we’re getting some volume as well. We did expect and we did see some losses in Aetna. It’s within our expectations and our outlook, and actually it stabilized throughout the quarter. So we saw something early and then since then, actually we’ve won some of that back and it’s not only not that gotten any worse but actually got a little bit better. So that’s about as much detail, Kevin, as I can go into in terms of the access changes.
Steve Rusckowski: Next question, operator.
Operator: Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, it’s Kevin Caliendo. Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin that was a little bit lighter than we had anticipated despite a little bit better pricing. Was it mix? Was it patient concessions? It’s not hugely meaningful but it just caught my eye.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So I don’t know what your expectations were, Kevin. To be fair, gross margin wasn’t significantly different than what we were expecting. The actual – the only area that was a little bit off our expectations was in SG&A. But there’s actually a geography issue in there that I want to make sure people understand. We have some portfolio investments related to the retirement plan that we have and the accounting dictates that if there’s gains or losses in that portfolio that you can either have expense or offset to expense above or below the line. We actually had $9 million of expense above the line. There’s an offset in other expense below line. So there’s no impact to our net earnings and our EPS and so forth. It’s a geography issue. But that didn’t inflate our SG&A $9 million relative to what we would have expected based on these investments. And last year, we had about $0.5 million actually decrease. So it’s a significant change year-over-year, about 50 basis points of impact. So I just wanted to make sure people understand, naturally geography, it’s not any sort of a trend in our SG&A. But from a gross margin standpoint, we were pretty much where we expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations. Mark, just to follow-up on that. As I think about the ramp in earnings over the course of the year, how should we be thinking about gross margin? And then I know, last quarter, you laid out a cost-cutting initiative that I think kicks in the second quarter. So if you don’t mind just walking us through the progression of that over the course of the year. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So when you think of the determinants of gross margin, obviously, it’s price, which is pretty much set for the year. As we’ve said that $200 million of pricing headwinds should cycle pretty at least proportionally over the four quarters. Obviously, not every quarter is equal in terms of the volume. In terms of mix, we’ve had a trend but we will see if that continues in terms of better test mix as our advanced diagnostics grows faster than our routine business. But we also have some of that offset through our PLS business as well. So mix can be a driver that goes both directions, we’ll see. And then the other one that I’d point to is certainly volume within a quarter. So when we talk about one fewer day having about 60 basis points of impact in the first quarter on our margins because in a short period of time, a lot of our costs are fairly fixed. That’s not all SG&A. Some of that is in cost of sales. When you think about our Patient Service Centers within a short period of time, that’s a fairly fixed cost. Our logistics and even somewhat some of our laboratory expense, although obviously reagents and some labor are variable. So other determinant certainly as we get that extra day back in the third quarter, that’s going to be a tailwind to our gross margin, not just our overall margins and so we have one fewer day in the first quarter was a headwind to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Hi, thanks. How much of the outcome units Preferred Lab Network was previously contemplated and or any of the labs are number of labs included surprise relative to your initial expectations. And then on the PAMA side, is there any sort of update on the industry efforts around PAMA release. And I guess any sort of meaningful movement on that front? And should it be assumed that any sort of relief would occur in 2021 or how should we be thinking about timing?
Mark Guinan: Let me take the Preferred Lab Network and then Steve will address the PAMA. So as I mentioned, we didn’t contemplate significant change and that obviously would be positive for 2019 in our guidance because we don’t have the details yet. In terms of the number of labs that have been included, we didn’t know. Obviously, we knew the bar was pretty high because we filled out the application, and we certainly have enough sense around the industry, and we knew it would be difficult for a lot of people to meet the criteria around service, access and quality So we were, I guess pleasantly surprised but not completely surprised that it’s a fairly short list because of what United’s looking for in terms of the requirements. So that’s kind of where we stand and once we hear from United, some of the details, we’ll be able to comment more about exactly what this means and how quickly we think it will become a tailwind and to what extent. In terms of PAMA.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So we are – as far as PAMA, as we’ve said, we are planning on the worse and working to get a better outcome. So what we’ve planned in our guidance and what we’ve planned in our outlook assumes the full impact of PAMA through 2021. Excuse me, 2020. And what’s happening as we speak is actually today, they’re hearing of a oral argument of our appeal. If you recall the District Court that saw on our case, decided not to rule on it because of jurisdiction issues, we appealed that and so we’re having our oral argument today. That will be heard. They will digest that and make a decision. But if it’s a favorable outcome in our behalf then we’ll be able to court begin, the senses that we’ll hear something this year and our argument and then the case will follow thereafter. Second is we don’t get a positive outcome then we could appeal in the Supreme Court will cross that bridge when we get to it. In parallel to all that, we continue to push with members of Congress that CMS got it strong. We need to take the time to get it right. We need to make sure that given all the data, because that was what was intended, that was the congressional intent and so we’re working with members of Congress on the legislative fix to make sure that we take the time to get it right. And essentially, what that would mean is push out the data collection period for some period of time to get the right amount of time for everyone’s future to submit the data. And again, that’d be 2019 data. So the data for first half of 2019 will be what is submitted, but we’re pushing to make sure that’s delayed. So that’s where PAMA stands.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ivy Ma: Hey, good morning. This is Ivy Ma for Derik today. So just wanted to, Steve, if you can get an update on the QuestDirect consumer-facing program there. So any order impact this year or beyond that you can characterize there? And then can we also get an update on the extension into retail partners so far this year. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Can you speak up with – on your question regarding QuestDirect? Sorry, we couldn’t hear you.
Ivy Ma: Sorry, just wanted to get an update on that program. Just trying to see if there’s any order impact that we can characterize this year or beyond?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So I would just say, we introduced our new offering for the fourth quarter last year. It’s off to good start. We’re seeing a nice month-to-month progression of growth. Nice adoption in the number of test categories. We did mention in the prepared remarks, our inclusion of a few bundles around sexually transmitted diseases. So we’re pleased with progress so far, and we did contemplate that in our guidance for the full year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk: Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Bill Quirk: Couple questions. First off, Steve, you talked about pricing transparency in your prepared comments. And this is a topic that you’ve touched on couple of times in the past. I guess bigger picture question here is, how should we think about this rolling out beyond Massachusetts. And then secondly, I guess following-up on Aaron’s question, given that we are into the data collection period second around PAMA, how should we think about the expanded number of participating labs and what that impact might have in the 2021through 2023 period?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. First of all, transparency in general. So the number of national payers, and I would say regional payers too, have pushed on educating their membership on a wide variation of healthcare costs. And yes, it’s about lab and it’s about everything. So a lot of visibility around radiology, a lot of visibility about every kind of procedures. So depending upon who you might have your insurance with, you probably have seen some of us. So that drum has been beaten and that it will continue to beat. In parallel to that is employers are hearing a lot of pushback from their employees about the cost of health care. We hear it at Quest Diagnostics, and we haven’t talked about it but we actually have done a lot of work to prevent the cost of Quest Diagnostics with their – our health care costs. And in doing so, where we’ve managed about 50,000 lives, we’ve actually built the cost curve. And the reason for that is employees are pushing back on their employers what they’re paying for out of pocket. So this is a premium cost. It’s a high deductible. So it’s the co-pays and full insurances. And so they give you a lot of noise and also those patients are pushing back on their physicians and physicians or pushing back on administration. So what I’ll say is this has picked up a lot of steam, and we are encouraged because when you look at the facts, you look at our medical quality, you look at the service performance and you look at our price points, we’re really second to none. And that’s reinforced with the Preferred Network with United Healthcare and there’ll be other payers that follow. So it will continue. We talked about Massachusetts as the state that has really put more out there, but we think more states will follow and more payers will follow and as more payers go down this path of a Preferred Lab Network, part of this will be around you can get the best quality, best service at the lowest prices from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So it’s going to be one of the opportunities that we take advantage of to pick up share.
Mark Guinan: And I just want to add to that, Bill, that the data collection period is actually in the fall. It’s the work that we do in the first half of 2019 but actually the submission and the collection is later in the year. And as Steve mentioned earlier, we’re working to try to get that delayed because we’re not clear on the changes, the impact of those changes and how much it’s going to expand to the hospital and others that did not submit last time. But we do know and agree that it’s going to be challenging for many of them to comply. And therefore, that’s why Steve mentioned for the trade association we’re lobbying to get that delated to give them a chance to do that and make sure that it comes in because we see that as the benefit to be more representative of the overall commercial market but also that they can get it done in a quality fashion. So there’s a lot of rationale for slowing this thing down. But it doesn’t happen until later in the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: So as part of the support act passed late last year, it looks like there’s some provisions that would impact the lab industry’s ability to pay incentive compensation based on sales goals. Can you help us provide some context on how that’s impacting your business today? And whether any changes to your compensation structure would be required if the law remains in effect for the foreseeable future?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. We recognize what you said that it could imply potential impact to the lab industry. At this point, based on the conversations we’ve had, I believe that, that was unintended. So we’re in dialogue around addressing that. So we have not changed anything to our compensation program in response to that, and we’re feeling comfortable. We’re obviously doing the right things to ensure that, that gets amended. That was not the intent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Steve, when you talked about utilization being normalized in the first quarter, I think many of us have seen United report and MLR below expectations. So can you just maybe define what you think normalizes on a percentage basis?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. The term I’d use is stable. We keep on doing our same-store or same-account measurement when we look at 100 accounts. You know they’re accounts of Quest Diagnostics, and we look at their volumes year-on-year. And we’ve tracked this for years. And what we see is it’s a stable environment, and this is for the nonhospital portion of our market. And equally for the hospital portion, we believe that’s stable as well if you look at the volumes that we see out there in the marketplace. We believe both are stable.
Lisa Gill: Is there a number you can put around that?
Steve Rusckowski: NO, no. Because I would say that it bounces around a little bit. But in general, we’re feeling that, that – it is within the range of a normal variation that we’ve seen historically. So stable is a good way of characterizing what we see.
Mark Guinan: And I mean, Lisa, I guess the tightest I could quantify it is that we’ve talked about a market that we think volumes are growing about 2% based on demographics and so on, which the given price headwinds pretty much take the revenue growth in the lab market to flat. And so as we look at the overall performance in the first quarter against our expectations and all the factors that play into it, including our competitiveness, there’s nothing that we saw in the first quarter that suggested a significant deviation from what we were expecting in terms of if you would call utilization, the overall market consumption of laboratory services.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask in terms of the retail strategy, if you can update us in terms of where the footprint stands today. Any plans for additional expansion here in 2019? And then the extent to which you see this strategy actually driving incremental growth and profitability?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Several things. One is when we started with takeaway stores, we’ve shared in the past that, that’s going well. Good results from those stores. Second is we’ve started a joint venture with Walmart. That has been progressively building and results have been very good. As you’ll recall, we started with Texas and Florida, we’re now beyond Texas and Florida. We’re in multiple states. We’re greater than 50 stores, approaching 75 to 80 stores throughout the United States. Again, what we’re finding is that it benefits all stakeholders. We think it’s good for Quest Diagnostics. And we’ve shared in the past that this is not about our savings in real estate. It’s actually an opportunity for us to get more productive with our phlebotomists as we consolidate those in one location. Second is its better location. So it’s better for employees, it’s also better for our patients that we serve. So they walk again for other purposes to get your script filled, do some grocery shopping, by the way they can stop at Quest. We give them a locator. They walk in the store. They come in conveniently. Many of those people are fasting. So they would like to eat before they leave. So good patient experience. And then finally, Walmart likes it because it’s more patient volume and it’s a good experience in their stores. And what we’re finding in those ZIP codes where we’ve done this, we do have an opportunity to pick up some share because it’s – again it’s a much more convenient location for us in that marketplace. So the patient has the choice they’re going to be going to the convenient location. And so what we’re driving to is if you look at the 2,200 Patient Service Centers that we have throughout the United States, we’d like to have about 50% of those Patient Service Centers eventually in more of a retail-like setting. So it gives you an idea of the extent of our strategy. And when I say that, we already have a retail-like strategy beyond Safeway and the Walmart locations because we’ve already had some of our Patient Service Centers in more of a retail environment than a medical environment. So of – the progress so far is – continues to be a good one. We’re encouraged by it and there would be progress made this year.
Mark Guinan: And so just to add to that, Matt, it’s not as much a cost play around the fixed cost because the phlebotomist obviously gets paid the same regardless of where we put them and the overall rent is not that much different. But really is it’s the volume leverage we get. So these are highly productive sites, especially in Walmart. And some of the reasons for that, obviously, as Steve said, it’s great access and convenience but some of our key stakeholders, the payers and the physicians, like that when they hear about, hey this can bring further patient because actually you want them to get the testing done. So as we talk about being positively differentiated from a vast majority of the market, certainly our retail locations, it’s not all about cost. Some of it is really around getting more volume and being more attractive commercially. And from some of the key stakeholders, we’re influencing or driving those decisions where they want to get their lab work done.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes and as you’ll recall, as part of our strategy, we’re using our data to support population health with extended care services. And so what you’ll hear more of is basic health care services that we’re also providing in those stores to manage a population. More to come on that but it’s beyond draw services for Quest Diagnostics as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
Mark Massaro: Good morning, Mark A -Mark Guinan Hey. Mark.
Mark Massaro: Good morning. Thanks guys for the questions. When I strip away the headwind of one less day in the quarter and the benefit from weather, I come up with organic volumes of 3.1%. That is above the long-term guide you have of 1% to 3%. So can you just help us think about the sustainability of this trend, especially given that you’ve got one additional day coming in the back half, you have volumes building throughout the year? And then second part of my question, is there any update to the work you’re doing with HCA in Colorado? And what do you think they need to see the potential to expand that?
Mark Guinan: So the – to answer your question, Mark, remember the outlook – four-year outlook I provided was revenue, not volume. And while our volume, if you adjust for the weather and the days, was north of 3%, our revenue was obviously in the single-digit basis points, 10s of basis points, not as high. So I think as we’ve mentioned, we expect that to continue to build. And obviously, in the four-year time frame, we’re expecting to get some of these pricing headwinds significantly lowered, if not eliminated, which will help the revenue relative to the volume. So I think that – hopefully that answers your question around the outlook and our performance in the first quarter. On HCA, Steve?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. On HCA, we believe that it’s going well. We believe if you ask HCA that question, they would give you the same feedback. Remember, this is in their Continental Division. So it’s actually one of our Professional Lab Services engagements where we help them become more efficient with their hospital laboratories. So we now again demonstrate, now that we’ve been into it for a couple of years, that we are saving them money, and they’re pleased by that and the quality has not anywhere – way deteriorated. So we’re hopeful, given the success there that we could take that model and try it in some other locations throughout HCA. We’re actively discussing that possibility as you would expect. But no firm indication that they will expand beyond it. But it is a success story for us within very large core profit system.
Mark Guinan: And just to add quickly, I know you all can do the math. With about 40 basis points of revenue growth, if you adjust for the two factors you mentioned, that gets us north of 100 basis points. So in the year when pricing headwinds are obviously extreme, where it hits the low ends, but within that three-year CAGR of revenue growth that I provided at the Investor Day.
Operator: Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Hey, Eric.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Kind of a three-parter here on Trident and the bankruptcy that you mentioned. First off, I see that they have debtor and possession financing that are still operational. But would you expect to gain volume in a situation like that when a bigger player announces a bankruptcy? Second of all, you did mention a customer bankruptcy in your prepared remarks, if I heard you correctly. I’m curious was that Trident since they are a diversified holding company? And then third, how have you – just remind us how you’ve generally planned or modeled for higher customer bankruptcies in 2019? Have you taken a more conservative approach this year, given what’s going on with PAMA? But I’m just curious if you could just remind us what you’ve done there. Thanks so much.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. I’ll take the beginning of that and then turn it to Mark to tell us what’s in our guidance, if you will. So yes, it is Trident. What we referred to is what you can read yourself related to their lab business where they served the nursing home marketplace. We have very little exposure to the nursing home business. It’s a tough market. We have a little bit of nursing home business. It’s not a big market opportunity for us. So the answer to your question, it all depends whether we pick up some of the volume. If we can make money out of it and we can serve the marketplace, well we would consider it. So it all depends on where the volume is and at what price points and whether we can serve the market well to really define the presence of our laboratories and where their facilities are. Mark, you want to…
Mark Guinan: Yes. So our remaining bad debt, and that will be separated from patient concessions out of bad debt and into revenue, is pretty small and you occasionally have a blip here. But we don’t have any expectations that we’re going to have significant headwinds on bad debt. A vast majority of that is hospital – our hospital business and then certainly, a chunk of that is actually physician client bill where in the States it’s permitted. The physician is actually marking it up and billing the commercial payer, and we are charging the physician. So assuming that they continue to get paid by the commercial payers, we’re certainly not at risk for any lack of payment ourselves. So when you said are we getting more conservative, are taking any steps in anticipation of payment driving more bankruptcy, I wouldn’t expect it to be within our customer base, our client bill base that you’re going to see that impact. So there’s really not anything we should do or can do beyond. We’re very diligent around monitoring collections from our client bill and that’s the easiest one. It’s not anywhere near as complicated as the third-party billing and involving the patients. So nothing necessary and certainly no significant headwinds expected or built into our contemplated guidance.
Operator: Yes. We have no further questions.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2018 Conference Call. At the request of the company, the call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation, and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables through our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Also, growth rate associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. As a reminder, the company now reports uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concession as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, we'll discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2019 guidance. For the fourth quarter, revenues decreased 1.4%, reported EPS was $0.92, down about 50% from the same period of 2017, and adjusted EPS was $1.36, down 2.9%. Performance in the quarter reflects increased reimbursement headwinds as well as softer organic volume than we expected at investor day, and the change in estimate of reserves for revenue and accounts receivable, which Mark will cover later in the call. For the full-year 2018, revenues grew 1.7%, reported EPS declined roughly 4% to $5.29. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 17%, to $6.31. In 2018, we grew revenues, adjusted earnings attached from operations despite some challenges in the marketplace. Mark will update you on the quarter, and share our perspective on 2019. Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share, and deliver revenue growth as our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of commercially insured lives in the United States. Volumes are off to a good start this year. Our guidance for 2019 reflects our expectation that strong volume growth will continue throughout the year. It also reflects significant reimbursement pressure partially offset by our continued execution of our Invigorate program. As we discussed at our investor day, in November, we are poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, panel-driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. In 2019, we expect about a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, and a similar reduction in 2020. The impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller independent hospital outreach laboratories which we believe could eliminate the majority of their profit, and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation. Second, payers are more focused than ever of driving better value in their [indiscernible], which supports our plan to gain share. And finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare cost than employers and their employees, the country's largest payer. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find the high-value low-price providers, like Quest. So, we are very well-positioned to benefit from these trends. Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements. Now, I'll share the progress we've made. First, we aim to grow more than 2% this year from M&A. In 2018, acquisitions contributed more than 3% to revenue growth. The nine deals we announced and closed, since the beginning of 2018, position us well to meet our 2019 target. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of a clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum, a leading provider of diagnostic and clinical laboratory services in the Midwest. The second element is to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. First on health plans, we're entering 2019 with the best assets this company has had in over a decade. We've added 43 million lives, which represents about a billion dollar opportunity for Quest as a result of our in-network status with UnitedHealthcare, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. As I said earlier, we have already seen encouraging volume growth early in 2019 resulting from this expanded network access. Hospital health systems are facing unprecedented financial pressures, and are therefore motivated to discuss ways we can help them with their lab strategy. We recently signed two new professional laboratory services agreements in the Southeast region. In both relationships we will provide full lab management employing technical lab staff, providing operational lab oversight, and maintaining responsibility for the laboratory supply chain. As we outlined at our investor day, most hospital CEOs and CFOs are still not fully aware of PAMA which impacts hospital outreach labs. We believe that this impact of PAMA becomes increasingly more visible, hospital will be more motivated to work with us on their laboratory strategy. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We made key acquisitions to expand our capability and enhance our service offerings in 2018. We saw strong double-digit growth in 2018 from a number of key test categories, including prescriptive drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing, and Cardio IQ. In 2018, we made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the laboratory provider of choice for consumers. Before arriving at a patient service center, patients can check in electronically through MyQuest and view estimated wait times before making an appointment. At the patient service center or in the physician's office, our enhanced real-time estimate let's patients know their financial responsibility before we collect their specimen. And then, once the results are available, patients can view them through MyQuest digital platform, which is now available for more than 6.5 million users, or they could review them on the Apple Health app. Next, we continue to build out our industry-leading retail strategy. At year-end, we'll be in more than 200 Safeway and Walmart locations. In 2018, we launched QuestDirect, a service which enables consumers to have a test without a doctor's script in the continental United States. And we're pleased with the volumes we've seen so far. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. Payers understand the value of the lab data and how it can help them improve their members' health outcomes. This has strengthened our value proposition as well. We're also growing revenues from pharmaceutical customers. Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in 2018, is helping pharma and CROs recruit patients for trials faster, better, and more efficiently. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Our Invigorate cost-cutting initiatives has been successful, and we see more opportunities ahead. We are confident there's an opportunity to continue to improve and save roughly 3% on a cost structure or about $200 million per year to offset increases in our wage bill as well as reimbursement pressures. At a recent investor day, we identified a number of areas for improvement, such as reducing denials of patient concessions, further digitizing our business, continuing to standardize and automate and optimize their lab and patient service center networks. Given the increased reimbursement pressure in 2019, we're also closely managing our cost structure. We are rebalancing our resources by reducing expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume increases we expect this year. Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance and our 2019 guidance in detail. Mark.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $1.84 billion, down 1.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 1.5% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a change in estimated adjustment to increase reserves for net revenue on accounts receivable that we previously highlighted in November. I will share more on this in a moment. Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 3.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 1.1%. Revenue per acquisition in the fourth quarter declined by 5.5%, versus the prior year, driven primarily by the reserve adjustments and increased denials in patient concessions. For the full-year, price headwinds were consistent with our expectations of slightly less than 1.5%. Now, I'd like to provide color on the reserve adjustment we made in the fourth quarter. You'll recall we discussed this at Investor Day. We recorded a change in estimate to increase our accounts receivable reserves by approximately $35 million. We did this based on the following: Unexpected increases in coverage denials and patient responsibility and a billing system conversion in one of our regional labs that resulted in timely filing denials and impacted our ability to precisely estimate reimbursement rates. Because these items were not typical with our historical experience we monitored them in accordance with our process increased our reserve levels. I am confident in our process and we have timed the level of precision around this complex estimation going forward. Before moving on, I'd also like to provide an update on the headwinds to our prescription drug monitoring hep C and vitamin D test categories that we've been testing over the prior couple of quarters. In prescription drug monitoring, we saw an increase in restricted payer policies that impacted both volume and reimbursement, but we lapsed denials for two of the more significant payers in the fourth quarter. In 2019, we continue to expect PDM reimbursement challenges as payers seek more clinical evidence to support coverage. Turning to hep C, as we noted previously, as these hepatitis C therapy reduces the need for genotype testing, while market share of this therapy continues to grow modestly, we expect to lapse the most significant headwinds by the second quarter. And finally, in vitamin D testing higher payer denials impacted both volume and revenue in 2018. One national payer implemented a more restrictive policy last March which we expect to lap in Q1, but we expect continued pressure on vitamin D testing in 2019. Moving on to the remainder of our fourth quarter results, reported operating income was $220 million or 12% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.4% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $271 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $317 million or 17% of revenues in the prior year. Reported EPS was $0.92 in the quarter compared to $1.82 a year ago. Note the prior-year quarter included a tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted EPS was $1.36 down approximately 3% from $1.38 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion in 2018 versus $1.18 billion in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were $383 million compared to $252 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following outlook for 2019. Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than 516 and adjusted EPS to be greater than 640. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. Now, there are several considerations that I will now review for you to think about in 2019. First, as we've shared previously, we are facing more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind is expected to be relatively and evenly spread throughout the year. Second, based on the factors I discussed earlier, the fourth quarter of 2018 should create an easy compare in the fourth quarter of 2019. Third, our revenue guidance includes more than 1% revenue growth from M&A that has already been announced and executed. Fourth, as Steve mentioned, our volumes are off to a good start this year, and we expect them to continue to build throughout the year. Finally, we are incurring incremental costs in the first quarter to support the volume growth from our expanded network access. We're also tightly managing our cost structure, and have undertaken a restructuring in the first quarter of 2019, and will begin to yield savings starting in the second quarter. As you think about the first quarter, we have approximately one less revenue day. And to remind you, denials in patient concession increased throughout 2018, and we are assuming these headwinds carry into 2019. Taking these into consideration with some of the items I just highlighted, we expect revenue to be flat to down in the first quarter, while adjusted EPS is expected to be similar to the adjusted EPS we reported in the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow revenue and earnings. Our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of the commercially insured lives in the United States, and volumes are off to a good start. Our guidance for 2019 reflects reimbursement pressures offset by strong volume increases, and continued execution of our Invigorate program. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Muken: So, as we look at sort of the fourth quarter and kind of what's implied in the first part of '19 and then over the balance of the year, I guess as you think about sort of the state of the lab market in general and some of the reimbursement headwinds you're dealing with, and then the flexibility of your cost structure, I guess in terms of your thesis for the business, obviously there's a lot of things that occurred toward the end of the year that were challenging for you guys, but yet there's a lot positive happening on the volume side. I guess how do you sort of put it all together for us so we can be confident that clearly the challenges we saw in the back part of this year you've sort of dealt with and now are reflected accurately so that we sort of found a rebasing side? And then what could you point us to kind of over the balance of this year that we should be looking for to kind of judge that the jump off into, hopefully, '20 and beyond, I guess, is going to be better? Because obviously you had a tough fourth quarter, the Q1 is supposed to be a bit weaker, and Mark you walked through that. And then we're sort of recovering. So I'm just trying to get a sense for confidence in some of the moving parts and your sort of evolved thesis here.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, let me start, and then I'll turn it to Mark. And thanks for asking the question. So start, we'd go back to what we shared with you in investor day. We still believe as the market leader we have a tremendous opportunity to gain share. And I think we just announced the kickoff of our journey to pick up share, and it starts in 2019. We also couple 2019 with the most significant reimbursement that this industry has ever seen, so in reimbursement costs, and so it's muting some of the share gains that we're going to pick up this year. But what we told you at investor day, there's two parts of our market share gains, is one is we do believe we can accelerate M&A, and we're actually targeting for 2% growth through M&A. What we said in our guidance, we only will put in our guidance what we have seen so far closed, so it's roughly 1% in the guidance for 2019. Second is, we will see organic growth, and we have to pick up the volumes to be able to offset that reimbursement pressure. But when you go through the math, we believe there's an opportunity for us to pick up share in '19, and that will continue in 2020. The second part of this is what's going on in the industry, and I'll come back to those three points again. One is, PAMA is hurting all of us, but it's going to hurt the non market leading laboratories much more significantly. We believe this will be a catalyst for further consolidation. Second is, with our better than ever access changes payers are working proactively with us in how they do a better job of managing our category of spend. And then finally, as consumers are pushing back on their physicians, pushing back on their employers and asking questions about the best value in the marketplace, and we are the best value in the marketplace; the best quality, the best service at the lowest price. So, Ross, we have really kicked off '19 with the beginning of a journey here to pick up share. And we believe with confidence that we can deliver that outlook that we outlined at investor day. Mark, would you like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes, sure, Steve. Ross, as I mentioned, and we've talked about several times, including the investor day, this year saw more dramatic changes throughout the year than certainly any one I've experienced since I've been at Quest. Denials were a big part of that. I'll start with the vitamin D change back in the second quarter, we saw more and more state Medicaid programs making decisions on cystic fibrosis, we've talked about prescription for monitoring and payers both tightening policies around same day of service for presumptive and definitive testing, which we think is clinically appropriate but they've put in policies to deny payment for one of those tests. We've seen them squeezing panels saying that they're going to pay for fewer and fewer analytes [ph], and again we don't think that's necessarily clinically appropriate but that is the way many of them are paying now. And even in the area allergy, there was an NCCI edit that was put in last year that resulted in significant denials in our allergy space. So, it was a tough year from a denials perspective. We have built all that into our 2019 guidance. And so when I talked about carrying the fourth quarter business into Q1, we fully accounted for all that in our thinking in the guidance we're providing. The other area of surprise was patient concessions. And we, based on what we knew going into the year, we're expecting a similar level of patient concessions. I'm sure you've seen and we referenced the Keiser Report that came out about the middle of the year that informed us and others that actually the average deductable went up significantly, so there was more being borne by patients. Obviously that meant more of our revenue was coming from patients, and we were just starting to see that in our collections because there's obviously a delay in the adjudication process to the payers, and then we -- as we send the bills out to the patients so we start to get an experience of the collection rate that may or may not match our historical rate, and was actually finding that it was being negatively impacted. The other thing I mentioned was we did have some issues with one of our lab conversions. We have done a number of these that we've shared. We're getting close to the endpoint in the standardization process. This particular lab was not a legacy Quest system, it was a system we had acquired a couple of years ago as part of an acquisition. We therefore did not do as well with this conversion as we did historically, and therefore we struggled, as I mentioned, with some filing deadlines and other things. The other issue is this is in a geography where historically there's higher rate of payment concessions versus other geographies. So, as we got delays in our ability to send out bills and as we looked more and more to patients and less directly to the payers, that definitely created a headwind. The good news on that one is we fully expect that to be behind us. And so that's more of a temporal issue versus the denials, which as I said. And the overall level of patient responsibility will carry into 2019, and is fully baked within our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Good morning. Steve, maybe just on the United trends, I know you gave some color. You guys are expecting a first tranche to move pretty quickly. Can you just talk through how it's come in relative to expectations? And then any way you can frame the expectations for the year would certainly be appreciated in terms of what's…
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. So, what I said in my prepared remarks, it's off to a good start. And we expected that it would be off to a good start, so it's on our expectation that we expected to be able to pick up some of the volume early in the year. But what we also said is that it will continue to build throughout '19, and also this provides us a growth opportunity beyond '19, into '20, into '21, okay. So, when I talk about a billion dollars worth of opportunity, we'll see a portion of that in '19, and that's contemplated in our guidance. But there is a large portion of that billion dollars beyond '19. So it's tracking well. We're happy with the early volumes we see. And it will continue to build throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Ralph Giacobbe: Just lab equipment size, an incremental $30 million headwind from Medicaid related to PAMA. Are you seeing similar -- I think you said over $200 million of reimbursement headwind, seemed a little bit worse than what you previously estimated, so wanted to understand that. And then if you could, real quick, you talked about incremental cost in the -- I think you said in the first quarter, hoping you can just size that, and whether that does go away for the rest of the year.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Mark?
Mark Guinan: Sure. Ralph, the $200 million is actually consistent with what I shared at investor day. The amount of PAMA headwinds outside the clinical lab fee schedule, where we're directly reimbursed from Medicare on fee for service, is not large. There's some Medicaid programs that have reduced their rates, they may have justified it or cited PAMA changes. It's hard to know whether these Medicaid rates are directly tied to PAMA. You can look across all the states, there seems to be potentially some direct relationship. Not all of them have changed the rates. So yes, there's a little bit of headwind in Medicaid as there typically is, that's not unusual, certainly not to the magnitude of the amount that you asked us about. And then, we're not going to size the investment specifically, but what we wanted people to understand is when you look at the rhythm of the quarters coming to the year, on the cost side, not only do we not benefit from the restructuring of our cost base that we announced at the end of this quarter until Q2, but we also are actually spending more in Q1 as we're making people aware of our new access in all of the geographies where we need to inform patients and providers. We're adding [indiscernible] by adding patient service centers, extra couriers, doing all the things to ensure that as this volume comes the customer and stakeholder experience is outstanding. And obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we see the volume, and either add more or less, but initially when you add that a little bit ahead of the volume it's cost versus cost of sales. So, that's really what we wanted to make sure people understood. And then the other significant item in terms of the quarterly cycling, as I mentioned, is one fewer revenue day that it is significant. We pick it up in Q3, but losing a day billing Q1 versus last year is going to be a significant impact in the year-over-year comparison.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Morning, Bill.
Bill Quirk: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions here, so first off, on vitamin D, real quick, just want to confirm that this is lower volumes versus, say, pressure on reimbursement levels. Also on the Medicaid denials, was hoping you could expand on that a little bit because it's pretty much universally covered, at least based on our due diligence. And then lastly, just big picture question for Steve, based on your conversations, how much volumes from the hospitals do you think could be play for M&A over the three-year PAMA period -- initial PAMA period? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Got you. Mark, why don't you take the first two?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so the Medicaid denials, and I'm not sure what you're referencing, Bill, but a combination of managed Medicaid where they put in more restrictive requirements, including preauthorization that often can result in denials. Also, some of it arguably clinically appropriate where they put in new intelligence to ensure that we only have this once in a lifetime. They may have had this done by a different lab. Historically we obviously weren't aware of it. We get an order, we think it's legitimate, we do the work, we provide it to the payer and they deny it based on it -- once in a lifetime policy. So those things are absolutely tightening in the cystic fibrosis. And we have had a couple of states, I don't have it at my fingertips, we'll circle back and do that actually, the state programs with traditional Medicaid that have stopped reimbursing cystic fibrosis as well. And vitamin D, as I mentioned, it was a combination. So certainly, we still continue to get and got orders with screening codes. Quite often vitamin D is ordered as a part of a bunch of other common laboratory testing. So we don't choose to not perform that test. Even if a diagnostic code initially is not one that suggest to get reimburse, so and absolutely the headwind to our revenue, revenue for rack. And has resulted in significant denials with the change in this national payer, but also as physicians have gotten educate them with the appropriate use and certainly, we're driving that. The industry is driving that, you have seen a fall-off because some of the vitamin D that was being ordered was prescreening and clinically that has been determined not to be appropriate. But there still is a number of vitamin D tests are coming to in the screen codes that really are not screening. The doctors just are not coding them appropriately, and unfortunately, those are resulting in denials and headwinds for us.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So Bill, on your question about the opportunities around hospitals, let me start by reminding you and everyone that, what we said in the Investor Day is in 2018, we have a strong year for M&A. It's about 300 basis points roughly. And if you recall, you go back to one of those Investor Day slides up for use and charts we use, if you look at the distribution of the M&A, we've done past few years, it's really been a balance of acquiring hospital outreach, acquiring some outreach deals. Excuse me, some laboratory regional deals and they are finally buying some capabilities and services and advanced diagnostics. And if you look at the hospital deals, it's been, a good part, but not a majority of what we have acquired. And then, second is we still pick up let's say one regional app for year. And that, in fact, we just said in our prepared remarks that we closed on voice and vitamin Missouri. So it's a good example of doing that once again. And what we also indicated is prospectively, we do believe it's obviously for all three categories, is that M&A should be north of 2% going forward. And we also said we've only contemplated in our guidance, something around 1%, which are those deals for 2019. So some portion of that is the acceleration in the discussions we're having with hospitals around their lab strategy. And we have those discussions Bill, we also have discussions around professional laboratory services and that's an organic growth opportunity. And we announced again in our prepared remarks that we picked up two engagements in the back half '18 that we feel good about and we have more engagements in the pipeline as well. So you need to think about our hospital strategy really from a contributor to M&A because of that 2% but also equally the opportunity organically to pick up organic revenue growth through these professional laboratory services engagements that we continue to announce.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Steve Rusckowski: Good Morning, Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark. I just really wanted to just make sure that I understand how we're thinking about the cadence of earnings this year. If I look at 2018, it looks like roughly 52% of earnings came in the front half, 48% in the second half. It sounds like it's going to be vastly different in 2019, am I thinking about that correctly that we're going to see a lot more of the earnings come in the third and fourth quarter just based on all your commentary whether we think about the incremental day in the third quarter, we think about anniversary in hep C, as well as vitamin D as well as some other things, so that would just be the first part of my question. And then secondly, also, along those lines, Steve you made this comment around the volume to build throughout the year as it pertains to the managed care contracts, can you maybe just give us some color, is that you are educating the physicians that are being in networks, is it what are some of the things that will have to happen throughout 2019 to give us comfort that you will see that volume?
Steve Rusckowski: Okay, Mark. It's for you.
Mark Guinan: So I'll start with the quarterly cadence Lisa. Yes, you're correct. So as we look at 2019, as I mentioned Q4, should be in we expected an easy compare to 2018 given the significant change enhancements that I referenced also and Steve will comment more color when we submitted, but we expect volumes to build. So while we certainly moved a bunch of offices and got incremental access volumes you know at the beginning of the year, we are continuing to compete that we expect to build more and more over time. And we also have referenced and are anticipating and hopeful that United will announce this preferred lab network. And we're hoping to be included that and we're expecting to be we're all waiting that announcement. We think that will benefit us as well, certainly with United patients. And yes, we have probably not gotten as much into the calendar impact on quarterly cycling in the past, but it is so significant, we're going to provide more transparency, so losing a day in the first quarter, getting a day in the third quarter, certainly well, change the year-over-year impact that is not insignificant. And then finally as you mentioned some of the timing of what we incurred some of the headwinds last year and when we left those and that will not happen in Q1. So therefore, we have some a topic compared to year-over-year in Q1 combined with the cost items that I mentioned earlier, so for all those reasons that compares much tougher in Q1. Last thing I would add is patient concessions. As we mentioned the beginning of the year, we did not anticipate a significant shift to patients away from the payers directly on where revenue would come from. Now that we saw what happened last year, we are building in a higher rate of patient concessions from day one. Obviously, over time as we look at our collections, we will adjust that, but that's certainly going to be a headwind in the first quarter as well. All of those things are built into the guidance that we provided for the year.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so just to fill out the question around volume growth throughout the year and the first tranche of the first quarter, so what we shared in 2018 is when we announced that we're going to be back in network with United and Horizon and with anthem in Georgia. We started to communicate that to our customers. And so, what we will see in the first quarter is the first tranche, if you will, of those really good customers's request that they wanted us to get back into network and we're ready to flip those accounts as quickly as possible. So you'll see that and second part of this is, why it's going to continue to build, it's not everyone is flipping on day one. I mean, they provide us an opportunity for the rest of '19 and then into '20 and '21 and some of this is that some of the market is still hearing firsthand from us that we're back in network. So the answer to your question what do we need to do is we continue to work on communication. We do this with our sales force, it takes multiple calls to the customer and to be able to flip those accounts typically, sometimes we need to work out some of the IT integration issues to make sure we can get those orders and as a result of those some customers that might be relatively new and that just takes some time. So if you take the state of New Jersey we are essentially we're back in network with the Blue Cross Blue Shield system in New Jersey and with United. We picked up a lot of access, so we've got a number of accounts that were detailing to pick up the gun and a chair for those taking more time than maybe where we only had -- did have 10% of the volume of those loyal customers in that first tranche. So that's what we're going to need to do and we'll do in backup and that will continue in 2020 and 2021 where we still see more opportunities to pick up shares.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Jack Meehan: Thanks. Hi, Steve. Hi, Mark.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Jack.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Jack.
Jack Meehan: I had a couple of just hoping for some details on both the rev per rack and volumes in the quarter. So on rev per rack down 5.5% by my math, the accounts receivable change was about two points. So if you could reach us on the remaining, what some of the factors are? That will be helpful. And on the volume side, how much did M&A contribute and the moving pieces between weather in calendar would be helpful?
Steve Rusckowski: And you're asking weather in calendar in Q4 Jack, or just?
Jack Meehan: Yes, all related to the fourth quarter.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. So the other drivers of revenue per rack include things like mix, so for instance, our PLS business which, as we explained in the past had higher as lower revenue per rack at a higher growth rate than our overall core business. So that created some headwinds on a rev per rack. And then, what I referenced in terms of the fact that the business experienced an increasing level of denials throughout the year and also patient concessions relative to the prior year. So those things all maybe the tough compared year-over-year Q4 2017 versus Q4 2018, so it wasn't just the change in estimates but it is actually a recognition that that business have revenue per req as we are exiting the year. So those are some of the contributors. We certainly had a little bit of weather impact, it wasn't significant but it was a headwind in that as well. In terms of days, that was a small impact, small negative impact as well. And the other thing was that we had some price changes in the back half of the year that will annualize in 2019 before the end of the year. So you combine all those things and those certainly were the drivers in the year-over-year decrease in rev req.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question.
Kevin Caliendo: Good morning, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks for the call. So I just wanted to go over the United the preferred network. You made the comment that you hoped to be included. And I would assume that you're planning on being included given that you're now part of your now in network but if you can clarify that that comment a little bit that would be helpful but also I just want to understand what you think is going to actually happen within the United Network come July 1, like what actually changes within the United behavior within their member behavior. You can sort of quantify that? That would be really helpful.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure, sure, first of all, one would think when we announced in May that we're back in the United and we're the Nation's largest commercial laboratory that if in fact United were to go forward with a preferred migratory network that we would be included. Now it's up to them to announce that. But we're clearly hopeful and planning on being one of the shortlist of laboratories that are included and in that, what we share with that in the past is that all payers and particularly United I think in my mind is taking the lead on this, is realizing that they could do more to do a better job in laboratory spending and by doing, by having a preferred laboratory network, they're going to tighten up the network and they will work with us on things that we can do to make sure that we drive market share gains. And that would include things like working with your customers that are so customers on benefit designs, it could include working with us on our hospital strategy where it could be in the best interest of all parties to think about a different network strategy within the geography. It also could include things that we're proactively going after certain geographies where we know there's an opportunity for us to gain share. So can announce it before it's announced but we're hopefully, we'll be included as you would expect, we should be given we're the largest national and given that we just announced that network and there'll be a lot of strategies within this to help us with our market deep plans that we've outlined through the course of the last six to nine months. So Mark, you would like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: I think that covers and obviously we're respectful of United's desire and right to announce, we've applied for that lab network, there is a certain set of criteria as we looked at it, we're very confident. But ultimately we need to wait for United and then in terms of what the particular aspects are I think Steve has captured it well, largely it's leverage preferred, you preferred for a reason obviously it's better value but it's also quality metrics and other things that United is looking for their members and therefore United, the patients and everybody is in the ecosystem who is in that preferred lab network will all benefit if there's more work sent to those better value providers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Good morning. So two questions, let me start with the payer one, so when you listed the factors that had a negative impact on price in 2018, you talked about payer denial that started in March when national pay is going to lab into first quarter. So what gives you confidence that other national payers are not going to follow the lead of the specific one, you have had conversations with payers and have you factored in that risk in your guidance range?
Mark Guinan: Ricky, thanks for the question. Actually a majority of the payers are already there and in the managed Medicare space they've been following MLCP for a while and that's really where this emanated from, Cigna adopted it in 2018, the labs remaining significant payer who have to do early on, we obviously have a very close relationship with Aetna, we expect Aetna to move in that direction and certainly that is built within our assumption, we don't know exact timing, we don't know for sure but certainly in our assumptions and our guidance we are expecting Aetna to go there as well and therefore all the national payers to be there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. So where you get your free cash flow guidance, it looks pretty strong despite the reimbursement headwinds, can you let us know what is embedded of that free cash flow guidance, is it how much share repurchase on this embedded, how much is slated to M&A and then secondly and typically you provided guidance range and you just doing minimum this time, is it a reason for that and maybe what are the biggest swing factors that could get you higher than that minimum range? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Sure, Ann. So the guidance on operating cash flow of $1.3 billion is obviously commensurate with our pacing around earnings, it is not a significant change in working capital assumes within those number, there is other puts and calls around some tax items and so on and so forth that impact our operating cash flow, that we take into account. But largely the change year-over-year is based on our net earnings. In terms of cash deployment, I talked about the 350 to 400 for internal capital which obviously we view somewhere between 900 and 950 of free cash flow, our dividend now gets us to long way towards our majority commitment to our shareholders but certainly we need to do some share repurchases to get ourselves to that at least 50% commitment and that is built in our expectations to basically this point preventing dilution given our equity program. We're now anticipating in that guidance that I provided a pick up from any reduction in ways down. So with the remaining free cash flow is going to be situationally dependent. So as Steve talked and I mentioned we have an main strategy we're expected to deploy chunk of that cash we're coming into the year with some good carryover based on deals that we've already executed but we just announced the closing of item beyond that we believe there's opportunity deploy more M&A but we're going to use the same financial discipline we always have and if we have a deal that with our money will create more value for shareholders we're going move forward on that deal and in a given point in time we don't have any excusable deal that meets our expectations then we will buy back shares as we have historically. So this point I don't have a specific plan or the balance of the year beyond our majority commitment and others and that's beyond the cash but we are deploying for the -- acquisition.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi, good morning guys. Steve, just a question for you as we talk about the payer consolidating market share to the top layers on your competitors call they talk about Blue Cross of Florida is a payer that they're having conversations with so. Is that something that we should start thinking about and if you just could give that goes in detail on that contract in terms of exploration and the set up that you have with them right now. Thanks?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, Brian, honestly we down pass some record due to specific comment on the specific payer. But what we have said is that were very nice shape. With 19 with our relationships, what we what we will say is that you know going into 19 we should have most of the nationals are in good shape, obviously they are with United where they would got out and the others will it will be a nice shape as well and then also these big states matter of fact, we talked about in their Investor Day, we pick up new strong bigger states United States. If you look at California with New York, Florida and Texas, about 110 million lives are shared very strong and our relationship with the other payer most states are quite strong. So we feel good about that and we're in nice shape in those states. And that is true to go back to your specific question about Florida. We feel good about our cousins in Florida, we have a strong working relationship with Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield and we feel we're in a nice position to deliver on good income share that we talked over all about doing at Quest Diagnostics in the state of Florida because of that relationship, and our great access that we have in Florida.
Mark Guinan: If I could just jump in real quick, I didn't hear the second part of Ann's question, my apologies, we jumped to Brian, so Ann and others, the reason we've chosen [indiscernible] this year is given some of the uncertainty this year, obviously, to make the call on how quickly we grow the volume, we move access, it's not a negative uncertainty, it's just more variability than we've experienced historically in terms of how the volume might come, where it will come from, et cetera. And so the guidance we're providing with the floor obviously is towards the lower end of our revenue guidance and to the extent that we hit the upper end of our revenue guidance, or even potentially surprise ourselves and beat that. Those would be the upside. So I think we've got our costs down pretty good. Really, the question is around the overall volume growth, the pace at which it comes and the source of which lies because obviously there's variability in the pricing and margin depending on which payer they come through. So that would be the opportunity to do better and hopefully that answers your question on why we chose to [indiscernible].
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my call.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning.
Derik de Bruin: I certainly have seen my out-of-pocket diagnostics costs creep higher now that I'm getting some work done on a regular basis, but I may not have noticed this if I was doing a one-off or annual visit. I guess, how do you drive consumers that shop around for their diagnostic vendor when they're at the hospital and if you're told to go to a hospital lab to get a sample, at what point can you intervene or can they intervene to ask Quest to run the tests since basically, it's like how do you give that consumer the choice to send it to the lower cross provider if the hospitals aren't telling you to go there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, that's a good question. So we've been on raising awareness for consumers around the wide variation, and medical costs broadly, and related to that is a multi-pronged approach. First of all, in some states, we actually provided this at Investor Day. The states are actually providing visibility of a wide variation for consumers. So the state of Massachusetts, they're actually providing on their Web site and if you go on that Web site you'll see the wide variation of what the average commercial rates for Quest Diagnostics are versus hospital outreach laboratories. And the hope is in that state since consumers are picking up a fair share of the costs in health care that consumers will start to become aware of this and bring that information to their physician. And the second part of this is physicians are the advocate, typically, for the patient, even though they have this relationship with the hospital systems and in some cases they sold their practice, but still they realize that this is coming out of their patients' pocket, they realized it could be a wide variation which for a number of a patients it's a considerable sum of money. And for those of us that are reasonably healthy might be once a year, but for many it's not once a year. So it's a considerable portion of our out-of-pocket cost. So we're making sure that the physicians are aware of this as well and then also you know that when you look at what we're doing with the payers the payers increasingly make it visible. And so the payers all reach out to their membership and have campaigns with simple messages like why pay more, and related to that it's not just the lab, you know -- I know many of you realized there's other ancillary services that you have the same issue. So for instance, radiology is getting a lot of visibility. So the help we're getting here as well is this topic in general is getting -- visibility from payers but equally from physicians and then with consumers asking questions. And then once they realize they can ask a question they demand that they [indiscernible] we are in network and therefore it's unacceptable that you tell them they can only go to the hospital lab. And they simply point to -- it's going to cost you extra money if they don't go to Quest, so Doc, why does this make sense? So that's what we're doing about it.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. You may ask your question.
Matt Larew: Hi, good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Matt Larew: I wanted to ask about your referral partners. You mentioned, Steve, that volumes had traded nicely through first quarter. I just wanted to get a sense for what of that you attributed to potential share gains versus increasing health care utilization at the end market level, thanks?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. First of all, yes, we're here and we're only -- I guess, February 14th, happy Valentine's Day, but what we see in the first five or six weeks of the year as we said we're off to a good start. We haven't been asked about it, but I'll share, you know, we think utilization volumes are stable. We're not seeing big pickups or drops in our good customers. So therefore, we think utilization environment out there is relatively stable. So therefore, the volume is coming from share gains. And that's what we expected. So, good start. We're picking up share, and that's going to build throughout the year.
Shawn Bevec: Operator?
Operator: You're showing no questions in queue.
Shawn Bevec: Okay. So thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support and questions, and have a great day. Take care.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At the request of the company, the call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question and answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please, go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018 and was adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concessions, as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I’ll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on third quarter performance and give you an update on our outlook for 2018. We grew revenues and continued to deliver strong earnings growth in the quarter. Revenues were up nearly 2%, despite the effect of industry headwinds we called out last quarter. Reported EPS was up more than 32% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew more than 25%. As you saw, we have revised our full-year revenue guidance to reflect lower than expected revenue performance this year, which was affected primarily by two factors. First, as we detailed in the second quarter, we faced headwinds in the areas of prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C, and vitamin D testing. While we made some progress, these testing areas continued to impact revenue growth in the third quarter. Second, in the third quarter, we also saw a rise in patient concessions, which Mark will touch on later. Before getting into the details of the progress we’ve made in the quarter, I'd like to provide context on some market trends, starting with an update on PAMA. Last month, a US District Court judge dismissed on narrow procedural grounds our trade association’s lawsuit over the implementation of new Medicare pricing for lab tests under PAMA. The Court’s opinion, however, acknowledges that ACLA’s arguments on the merits raise important questions, about HHS’s actions. This is, of course, disappointing for our industry; and it is potentially harmful to Medicare beneficiaries. Last week, ACLA appealed the District Court’s decision, demanding a hearing on the merits. At the same time, the industry continues to pursue a legislative fix. Additionally, CMS and our industry continues to work together on addressing the current PAMA issues. So, as we sit here today, PAMA is having an impact on Quest and the rest of the lab market. Increasingly, smaller independent labs and hospital outreach labs are struggling financially, due to lower Medicare reimbursement, not only directly due to PAMA, but also under contracts with pricing indexed to Medicare. Some have begun to exit the business, citing PAMA as a factor. We’re continuing to plan and manage our business as if PAMA is here to stay. At the same time, there has been increasing scrutiny of the wide variation in health care pricing in the popular press. Consumers and employers, who pay for most of healthcare, are becoming more price sensitive. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that health plans that exclude costly providers can be much less expensive for consumers and employers. Quest offers a great customer experience, and coupled with our scale and efficiency, it makes us an exceptional value in the market, compared with hospital outreach labs, which often charge two-to-five times more than Quest. So, in short, there are three reasons we believe the market will continue to consolidate and therefore afford us an opportunity to accelerate growth. First, reduced reimbursement through the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule is beginning to have an impact on the laboratory industry. Second, health plans are embarking on a new strategy, looking to national labs to help drive efficiency in lab spending. And the finally, consumers and their employers are more attuned to the variation in healthcare pricing. Turning to the third quarter, I’ll review our execution against the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions. We announced three acquisitions in the third quarter, which strengthen our capabilities in several key areas. First, our acquisition of PhenoPath, which has a strong record of innovation, provides several capabilities that complement and extend our own, particularly in the area of pathology and molecular oncology. It also expands our presence in the Pacific Northwest. Our acquisition of the U.S. laboratory services business of Oxford Immunotec will extend our capabilities in infectious disease diagnostics. It will also bring us greater choice to physicians who seek innovative blood-based tuberculosis and tickborne disease testing. And then finally, our acquisition of ReproSource expands our expertise in reproductive diagnostics. Since the third quarter close, we have also announced the acquisition of Hurley Medical Center’s outreach lab operation in Flint, Michigan. In this case the seller indicated reimbursement pressure as a factor in deciding to exit the business. Additionally, we acquired the assets of Provant Health to strengthen our employer wellness business. So, the acquisitions we have announced and will close in 2018, already position us within our 1% to 2% revenue growth target for next year. And, as I indicated, PAMA should further contribute to our strong M&A pipeline. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. We continue our preparations to take advantage of the opportunity to offer a first-class customer experience for UnitedHealthcare providers and their members when we become an in-network lab provider on January 1. Our commercial team has already been proactively reaching out to educate physician customers about their ability to use Quest for their UnitedHealthcare members. The revenue opportunity presented by the United contract will ramp over time. We do expect some portion of this new work to transition quickly. However, the larger opportunity to help UnitedHealthcare drive lower lab spend is expected to be realized over the next several years. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our announced acquisitions in the quarter mentioned earlier will enhance our capabilities in advanced diagnostics, especially in the areas of Women’s Health and Infectious Disease. We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring and Quantiferon tuberculosis testing. Additionally, this quarter we saw solid growth in Cardio IQ, as well as testing for sexually transmitted diseases. On our second quarter call, we highlighted several market headwinds that impacted growth in prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and vitamin D testing. We saw modest improvement in the third quarter. For example, PDM denials have steadily improved each quarter this year. We’ve also started to lap hep C headwinds we began to experience roughly a year ago. In aggregate, the issues we have mentioned related to these three tests contributed approximately 100 basis points of headwinds this year against our original revenue expectations. We continue to make progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Quest Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and generate great feedback from our customers. In fact, for locations open more than 6 months, we’ve seen an uptick in volumes compared to the patient service centers they replaced. We are currently operating inside 21 Walmart stores in Florida, Texas and now Illinois. We combined with our partnership with Safeway, we expect to have well over 200 patient service centers in retail store locations by the end of 2018. Consumers continue to embrace our digital experience. We now have more than 6 million users on our MyQuest app that lets them view and analyze test results, schedule their appointments, see patient service center wait times, and then finally pay their bills. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics of extended care services. We’re seeing continued interest in Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in June. This is a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and CROs increase the speed of commercializing new therapies. We’re working with several pharma, biotech and CRO companies with this new solution. The second element of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. At the end of September, we launched a new appointment scheduling system for our patients. This new system utilizes best-in-class technologies to help patients schedule appointments at a convenient location. In the second week of deployment alone, we saw appointment-related calls into the National Customer Service center drop by more than 10%. Our Online Specimen Pickup option has been a big hit with our physician customers with nearly 20% of routine pickup requests now handled electronically versus making a call. Physicians have given us positive feedback on the ease, efficiency, and simplicity, compared to waiting on the phone and writing down those confirmation numbers. And then finally, our Invigorate program remains strong, and we’re on track to over-deliver on expected savings for 2018. Overall, we continue to make excellent progress on our operational excellence strategy and our leaders will be sharing more insights, successes, and plans with those that attend our Investor Day, which will be held November 29, in New York. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 1.8% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report patient concessions as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt, due to a required change in revenue recognition accounting. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew 1.9%, compared to the prior year, driven by acquisitions and an easier compare, due to the hurricane effect last year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. Revenue per requisition in the third quarter declined by 80 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It also includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix, and tests per req. During the third quarter, unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations for the full-year with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and approximately 100 basis points from all other factors. As we’ve shared previously, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, due to PAMA. Other mix elements remained positive in the quarter and partially offset the impact of reimbursement headwinds, as well as growth in our professional laboratory services business. Reported operating income for the quarter was $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $298 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $311 million, or 16.5% of revenues, compared to $325 million, or 17.5% of revenues last year. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to several factors, including: investments related to tax reform savings, which had a 60-basis point adverse impact on operating margin; integration efforts of acquisitions, which take time to deliver a full margin contribution; and the impact of PAMA. Reported EPS was $1.53 in the quarter, compared to $1.15 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up approximately 25% from $1.35 last year. During the quarter, patient concessions, previously recognized as part of bad debt, were up as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We continue to see an increase in patient revenues as a percentage of total revenue, due to the ongoing trend of rising patient deductibles and an uptick in uninsured patients. Cash provided by operations year to date was $905 million versus $852 million last year. Capital expenditures year to date were $232 million, compared to $170 million a year ago, which is in-line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now, turning to guidance. We are updating our outlook for 2018 as follows. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.62 billion, an increase of approximately 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS to be between $5.57 and $5.64, and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.60. Cash provided by operations continues to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million. Our updated guidance reflects the industry headwinds we’ve experienced versus our expectations in 2018. While we aren’t prepared to share 2019 guidance, there are some elements I’d like you to keep in mind. First, we have a significant opportunity to grow with our new UnitedHealthcare contract. However, moving in network comes with lower reimbursement versus the out of network services we provide to UHC patients today. Second, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are already on track to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A next year. Third, as you are already aware, the impact from PAMA is expected to increase from a headwind of approximately 50 basis points this year to more than 100 basis points in 2019. And finally, we expect approximately 150 basis points of reimbursement pressure beyond PAMA from our third-party payers, which includes the impact of becoming an in-network provider for United and other health plan contract changes; as well as hospitals and physicians that we bill directly. After considering all these headwinds and tailwinds, we are well- positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at Investor Day. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, revenues grew and we delivered strong earnings in the third quarter. We're excited about our M&A activity in the quarter, and are well-positioned for top and bottom-line growth in 2019. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 29. Now, we’d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Ross Muken: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. So, it seems like one of the incremental updates, Q-on-Q was sort of the concept of patient concessions being an incremental headwind, could you just give us a little bit more color, just sort of how that’s playing out and why that sort of incrementally was sort of a surprise that popped up? And then, as we think about, sort of, in the next year, just a little bit more color, I know you don't want to give guidance on sort of the headwind you are expecting vis-a-vis sort of some of the network pricing pressures, inclusive of sort of the added networks United business getting repriced just kind of put the full picture together on, from what you were trying to get across in maybe those two points?
Mark Guinan: Well, Ross, on patient concessions, you know we have a larger percentage of our revenue coming from patients. And as we’ve shared in the past, the un-collectability, so it is bad debt for other sources what we call patient concessions from patients proportioned is much, much higher from patients than it is from any others source. So, we all have almost 0 bad debt from all the other revenue sources. So, really what was previously bad debt and now is patient concessions is largely a factor of collecting bills from patients. And again, a little bit of it is from the uninsured and most of it really comes from patients who have insurances, who are in the deductible and so they are paying a large proportion on all of their medical cost or it is from their coinsurance. And so, as that mix changes, unfortunately even though we are improving and continue to improve the bad debt rate or patient concession rate, through some of the things we’ve done such as putting in our Easy Pay in our office phlebotomist and also our patient service centers also giving more transparency of price ahead as we talked about with our transparency tool with large amount of payers or patients know the cost, know the responsibility they have and it gives us a chance to collect upfront. Just because of mix that has been a headwind and as you know now with the accounting changes it’s not just a headwind to operating margin, but it’s a headwind to revenues as well. To your question why we couldn’t see this coming, I mean we really don't know until we start doing collections and so given the cycle itself of performing the service, and then billing the payer, potentially having some back-and-forth claims on the adjudication, and ultimately billing the patient and seeing our collectability, you know it takes some time. And so, we obviously don't know if there is any definition of what’s driving this, but when you look at some of the recent information that’s come out from several sources around deductible, amounts are actually going up on average, so patients are paying a greater proportion of their healthcare, especially the patients that use a lot of our services because large majority is for healthy patients who go to the physician for a regular checkup. Therefore, we believe that that’s a factor and a second one, there has been a small increase in the number of uninsured patients that we’re serving. Obviously, we don’t know whether that was driven by some changes in the Affordable Care Act recently or what’s driving that, but we definitely have seen that. So that’s on the patient concessions. On the pricing, that’s what I was trying to do, was to give you all the moving pieces. So, when you look at the totality, obviously we’re looking at a very attractive volume opportunity from network access with United, and it does come with a lower price, it comes to more of a market price for in-network laboratory. So, it’s a good price, but it is lower than we were being paid previously. We just wanted to make sure people have that understanding in their models and then the other price, which we talked about of being 100 basis points or less will continue. A fair proportion of that is not from third party payers it is coming in very competitive hospital market, and also from physicians where we client bill or directly bill that physician and they bill the third-party as opposed to us billing the third-party. So, we wanted to make sure that people understood all the dynamics that are driving price. So, when you add all those pieces up, they said, PAMA is going to be approximately 100 basis points and we’ll have about 150 basis points from other sources in 2019. However, given the M&A pipeline that we have and the deals that we’ve already signed and have closed recently, and along with the access and continued improvement in some of the market headwinds that are hitting competitors, as well as I ended that section we’re very confident of our ability to grow revenue and to grow our earnings in 2019, and I’ll shed some more color on that at the Investor Day.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. And this is something on the patient concession thesis. I’m reminding everyone that close to two years ago where we teamed up with Optum and UnitedHealthcare around our revenue cycle management or building operations. So, we're working hand-in-hand with Optum on what we could do to affect bad debt, as well as denials. We have really enjoyed the working relationship. Matter of fact, this week I’ll be with that team. We’ll talk about what we’re seeing and how they can help us here as well. So, that relationship continues to be strong and that’s going to help us as there is more and more pressure on this side of our business.
Ross Muken: Thanks. And maybe just quickly on the offset side, you had some incremental investments you made this year that offset some of the tax benefit, and there is also the potential to maybe push back a bit on the supplier side, so I guess how are you thinking about, you know those are the pushes, the pulls that you have to try to maybe recapture some of that margin you are seeing hit by both PAMA and the other [indiscernible]?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, I will take that at the beginning of this which is related to investments. We continue to make those investments we think are prudent for the capacity we're going to need giving what we anticipate is volume increases in 2019. This is as we would expect at the real granular level thinking about where we are at present, where we are going to pick up lives with United and therefore where we will pick up some shares. So, that’s happening and it’s in our numbers. Second it is we continue to honor our commitment to our employees paying out a bonus that will come up in November, that is an investment to share with our employees, we feel good about making sure we have a good workforce that feels good about working at Quest and that continues. And then finally, the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the five growth strategies outlined continue to be a promising opportunity for us as we come out of this year and we enter 2019. So, none of that is changing and we’re making excellent progress on all those elements.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Ross when you walk through those three, you know the bonus was a one-time bonus, so that’s not going to repeat in terms of the investments for network access expansions. Those become cost of sales. So, when you’re adding [indiscernible] people from the laboratory adding patient service across centers then all of that is investment ahead, but then it becomes our cost of sales. And then finally, on the other investments that Steve referenced, we will make those decisions along with everything else. We decide in terms of long-term, short-term results and also affordability to get into that year. And of course, I’ll turnover over to Steve the most important piece.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. You asked also about the offset of working with our providers, excuse me, our suppliers and yes, this is all in an ongoing approach we have had with our invigorate program. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we exceeded our goals for this year, part of that is what we do with our suppliers. Our suppliers are well aware of what’s happening with PAMA, matter of fact they are working with us on a legislative solution. This is through the AdvaMed organization, which is the device trade association. So, they are actively working this with us and are very much aware of the pressure there will be on this industry. And beyond what we do with our suppliers, we continue to look at efficiencies and we hope that many of you will come to our Investor Day, because we’ll be outlining more of the opportunities we see beyond 2018 into 2019, 2020 and 2021 with more efficiency gains, because as we shared over the past several years, even though we did hit that $1.3 billion goal, we see more opportunities in front of us to continue to run a higher quality more efficient operation going forward. So, we look forward to you joining us to secure more about that.
Mark Guinan: And just very quickly, two of the items that Steve referenced in his prepared remarks about appointment related calls dropping by more than 10% and specimen pickups being ordered online versus call, those are part of the efficiency and obviously we expect to continue to reduce the amount of phone calls we get and actually drive you the more efficiency going forward.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
AJ Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe I will ask about the retail initiative. I know Walmart recently had an Investor Day where the just talked about the 15 locations that you work with them on expanding to the Midwest and envisioning over 100 location, ultimately in place, any comments you guys have about timing of that? And then also I know you're working on some pilot stuff with Aetna CVS, any update on that? And then how much is the retail? At this point, is it enough to move the needle in terms of its contribution to revenues, how would you describe where you are at on that?
Steve Rusckowski: First of all, AJ thanks. I mentioned in the script, we continue to add stores. We're happy with the progress there. We are at 21 stores now and it continues to build and I tell you that that number will be much higher than that by the end of this year. And we focus on the big states of Florida and Texas and also, I said that we moved into the Illinois as well. So, there will be other states beyond those throughout the rest of this year. So that continues to build. So, what you heard from Walmart is aligned with our view. Second is, the experience has been quite good. It’s been good for our patients; those patients are also Walmart consumers. Walmart likes the volume in the stores or volume is like the experience as an employee serving their customers better. And in fact, when we look at the volumes that we see in those sites that have been open long enough, we think it actually does have an effect on our market share within that geography. So, all around good presence, but we're not stopping there, the opportunity we talked about continuing to work with this joint venture with Walmart is how we provided other healthcare services and some of those locations, in fact we were detailing that out with Walmart and you will hear more about that. We hope to provide more color around those services at our Investor Day in November. And then equally, what CVS, now with the planned merger with Aetna will do with their strategy is a continuation of what we’ve done with them in the MinuteClinic, and we're hopeful, as well as they continue to walk on those integration plans with Aetna given our great relationship with Aetna, great relationship with CVS, they do see an opportunity with the brick and mortar they have and with some of our capabilities of providing basic healthcare services. So, when we come to Investor Day, what we will do is, walk you through what we call our diagnostic services, which includes how we use our data and how we use the services and capabilities of Quest to help bend the cost curve. And some of that will be done with our Walmart joint venture and some of it will be done with other partners like CVS, but we do believe it’s a great opportunity for growth in the near-term, but also for the long-term because we're just getting started frankly. So, more to come on that and we hope that you show up for the Investor Day in November.
AJ Rice: Alright, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Hi, how are you? Maybe just on the three headwinds, PDM, hep C, and vitamin D, you know headwinds persisting here throughout the end of the year, can you maybe just update us on the trends and visibility on that turning around, I'm just trying to figure out how much that could leak into 2019 as we think about numbers kind of going forward for next year?
Mark Guinan: Sure. On the hep C as we mentioned, that is starting to mitigate because we’ve lapped year when, you know the [indiscernible] drug started to take significant share. So, at some point, most of that business goes away or it stabilizes or maybe even the drugs make a comeback, I know there is some pricing competition and an area that might change the competitive landscape. So, that should not continue to be significant into 2019. On PDM, I want to be clear as Steve mentioned, it continues to be a growth engine for us. Unfortunately, we’re doing more volume than we are - revenues. So, revenue is growing, the following is growing faster and that’s because of some of these denials. I can't put a stake on the ground at this point as how quickly we’re going to address that. I guess the important thing is that even though that headwind may or may not get addressed in the near-term future. As Steve also referenced, it’s stabilized. So, we're not growing in denials. So, we are reaching a point where the denials are still much higher than it should be and much higher than we find acceptable. It’s not going to be continuing to be a year-over-year headwind. And certainly, we make some progress there could actually be a tailwind moving forward. And then on vitamin D, I’d say it’s still early. As we mentioned, we still believe that a number of these denials are because of miscoding based on a long history of physician coding practices, and not necessarily denials to patient eligibility. And so, how many of these things will be rectified when the physician community understands. For instance, either of these patients is now eligible for vitamin D and I need to use the appropriate code versus now this was just a screening and now it’s other others including, as we mentioned, Cigna starting to apply Medicare type of approaches to their coding that this actually would be a denied task. But at some point, again, as you mentioned, you get that behind you and it all continues to be a headwind once the market adjusts and patients are appropriately getting prescribed with the right diagnosis code and then vitamin D continues to move with the market as it has been doing historically.
Steve Rusckowski: So, as just to reinforce what we said in the script is that, we have the three together, we looked at our expectations for this year and how it has affected us. It’s about 100 basis points and that’s our business and I’ll just to remind everyone, we’ve talked about this before. We are the market leader on prescription drug monitoring. So, very strong in that category, continues to grow, but we clearly have more exposure than a lot of people on that space. So, therefore, any effect of those three have a bigger impact on us. So, the 100 basis points is our estimated. And as Mark said, we continue to work this. We started working this in Q2. We’ve made some modest progress. As I said in my remarks, we will continue that throughout this year and then again as we start to lap it, we'll have less of impact year-on-year, but different than what we expected, but still growing in these three categories.
Mark Guinan: And then just to add to what Steve mentioned, those three had about 100 basis point negative impact versus our expectations and then the patient concessions were another 30 basis points.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay, that’s helpful. And maybe just a quick one on the payer shifting with United, you’ve talked about a few different buckets of customers, just framing that opportunity, I guess now that we're a few months in, and you’ve done more work on the market on United itself, what fragment of that market do you think you're kind of viewing as early adopters, you know shifting quickly in 2019, just trying to frame that opportunity?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. The business opportunity we have is, those customers of ours that have the majority of their laboratory testing coming to us already, but might just have another laboratory because we are not in network with United. So, those are the accounts we’ve already knocked down their doors, we have shared with them the great news that we’re going to be in network starting January 1. We have worked on what we need to do of anything in terms of IT integration, we get those orders in-house and those will come to us early in 2019. Those types of customers. The second group of customers that I’ll broadly put in this category is that might have multiple laboratories, and our job is to make sure we gain share. And given the access that we have starting in 2019, which is really remarkably better, we believe there is also an equal opportunity for us to gain share beyond those great customers we have for all customers to pick up share. Particularly some of the large states we’ve talked about this, when you look at Florida, Texas, California, New York, our access is going to be north of 95%. So, great access in the marketplace, great value proposition or quality service, and also pricing, we believe we have an opportunity to pick up share in those accounts.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, first on housekeeping, if I missed it, my apologies, but what is the all-in organic revenue growth number for the quarter and the specific contribution from M&A?
Mark Guinan: So, the revenue growth was pretty much all M&A in the quarter.
Derik de Bruin: Got it. Okay. And if you – two follow-up questions, I guess, did your volumes get effected this quarter by some seasonality and consumer genomics testing? I know that’s been a tailwind for the business, I know there is some – this is a weak quarter for that one and then follow-up on that one is going to be just on deal valuations, are things coming in? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Yes, so we didn’t experience any meaningful change, due to seasonality in the quarter around genetic testing. And then, sorry your second question Derik?
Derik de Bruin: Basically, just valuations on deals in the fact that people – people are they getting involved a more bit attractive?
Mark Guinan: Yes. No, I think the valuations really haven’t changed materially. Obviously, you’ve got to price in the PAMA headwinds. Although, we are hopeful that we can positively impact that at this point. More pricing things as if those PAMA cuts will happen, that’s the way we are valuing things. So, therefore, if anything, valuations have come down, and the seller, or potential seller recognizes that as well.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, just, I believe your question is around consumer genetics. Just to remind everyone, we do have a relationship with Ancestry and we provide a genotyping for their ethnicity offering. It’s a modest portion of our business and continue to get growth, but it is modest for us. We’re optimistic about the opportunities with the Ancestry because we still believe it is an opportunity for us to work together with that around building awareness overall, around the importance that everyone knowing our family health history, and that’s an opportunity for the future, but just with the context, in terms consumer generic testing it is a small portion of business with modest growth this quarter.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Hi, thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the volume commentary, so I think you mentioned that it was around 70 basis points when you excluded M&A, how much did weather contribute to the year-over-year growth? And I guess just my math would suggest the underlying utilization was down year-over-year? I know you have talked about some of the issues, but what’s your level of conviction that that can improve in the fourth quarter into 2019?
Mark Guinan: So, most of the fourth quarter ‘improvement’ is really coming from the M&A we did, so that’s giving us some lift. We don’t expect a step change improvement in utilization what we call same account volumes. And then in terms of weather, we have some impact, but it wasn’t material enough to call out, but certainly it was a slight headwind to us in the quarter.
Jack Meehan: Sorry, weather was a headwind?
Mark Guinan: Sorry, I was talking about the hurricanes this year. So, we talked about the fact that versus last year we had a favorable compare, I thought you were asking us weather the hurricanes that took place in Carolinas in the third quarter were significant factors? So, we did call out that we had a favorable compare and it was about 150 basis points in the quarter, but there was a slight negative impact this year from hurricanes in 2018.
Jack Meehan: Great, and then just as my follow-up, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more on your pricing comments at the end of the script Mark? Can understand the PAMA stepping up, but the 150 basis points beyond PAMA, I know in the past you’ve talked about 100 bips normal unit price, is that 50 bips kind of incremental related to United and then as you size it all up just do you think mid-to-high single digit earnings growth is doable for 2019?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, the 50-basis point isn’t tied directly to the United, but certainly directionally United is one of the major drivers there, and I’m sure you are familiar with the way pricing works. So, we had significantly higher reimbursement from United as an out of network provider than what typical in-network takes on and what we negotiated with United. So, yes that’s a big driver, but it’s not entirely United. And at this point, I’m not going to give any guidance for 2019. So, what I will reconfirm is that the Investor Day outlook that we provided of having a 3% to 5% topline CAGR, and a mid-to-high single digits EPS CAGR from 2017 through 2020, we still stand by that. Obviously, we have got one full-year and three quarters of a year behind us and when you look at our guidance, it so puts us within that range and so what we’re saying is that we work through the next two years. We are certainly still confident that we can deliver within that CAGR range without giving any specific guidance for a given year.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Just to reiterate, we will grow topline and bottom line in 2019. We have said that. What we have also said is that, the M&A that we have already shared will get us to comfortably in that 1% to 2% growth in 2019 and when you couple that with the United opportunity that we’ve speaking about gives us confidence on our ability to say, yes, we will grow top and bottom line next year.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, Steve.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk: Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi Bill, good morning.
Bill Quirk: Good morning. First question, Mark, just not to beat a dead horse here on 150 basis points that you signaled for 2019, but is any of that related to additional plans kind of following or trying to follow some of the PAMA rates down, I know historically you’ve indicated that you don’t have a lot of contracts that are tied to Medicare, but just trying to tease any nuances out here?
Mark Guinan: No, it isn’t. There are some small changes in some Medicaid rates that states have made, specifically Ohio. I mean, you can argue whether that was in any way related to PAMA. I think they actually had a budget issues, they wanted to fund some Women’s Health initiatives and they slammed the laboratory reimbursement rates. There certainly was some dialogue around where Medicare was going in some of the states, if not many of them look at Medicare as a signal for where the Medicaid rates should be, but in terms of commercial plans, no, there isn’t any incremental headwinds because the commercial plans are trying to take advantage of PAMA. In fact, as we have shared the dialogue we’ve been having with the commercial plans as they see that as an issue for them because the more pressure we get from other sources, the more we need to get from them, and therefore it’s in their own best interest not to see that because they know in the next collection period that the potential recalculation could be even more severe if we give lower commercial rights. And so, they are very sensitized to that and I can assure you that we are holding very firm in those discussions and make sure that they understand the world where you have a significant difference between commercial rates and government, and certainly Medicare rates is going to go away. The whole intent of PAMA is to move go rates to a market type rate, which says that we need to talk about other ways to create value beyond price and that’s what we’re doing. Increasingly, we’re walking in and talking about all the other ways we differentiate ourselves positively, but then I fully appreciate and then some of the things that Steve highlighted in his remarks, around the patient experience, the technology we’re putting in our patient service centers, the ability to build a relationship through the MyQuest app schedule appointments make things easier. Because at the end of the day, the payers want their patients to get appropriate necessary testing done, and so therefore that’s definitely a good thing. It’s also our data the way we feed data and the more critical mass we have the easier it is one them to do the analytics in a world where data is increasingly important for population management. So, there is a lot of ways that we talk about our value proposition. And then finally it is as Steve mentioned or where they recognized that they have a cost curve. They need to start working with the best value providers and certainly will want those and starting to move volume as a high cost less attractive value providers into the better laboratories and that’s the way they are really going to save money and drive better value for their members versus continuing to look to extract price out of those who already have the best prices in the market.
Bill Quirk: Got it. Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So, one question that I have, if we go back Steve to your comments about the UnitedHealthcare converting from out of network high price to in network lower price, I think something that would be very, very helpful for us is we think about the opportunity next year in longer term, if you can give us some sense of your share as an out of network provider with United ?And I understand that you might not be able to give us the United data, maybe some sort of a framework for us to think about, what type of share do labs typically have in an out of network relationship?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so let me do this. I remind many of you on this call of what we talked about of the opportunity we see with the United, which if you go back and you recall, we’ve talked about the opportunities that many of the health plans see, it is by working with one of the nationals as ourselves we can do a better job of helping them reduce their laboratory cost. And what we talked about with the United define the opportunity in front of us is, we have talked about Untied estimates that they spend anywhere from $7 billion to $8 billion in laboratory spend a year, and most people have estimated that the nationals maybe providing about a billion of that. So, therefore, there is a big opportunity as they think about how they do a different job and a better job of serving their membership with Quest and at least one other national provider to reduce that spend. So, when you look at that 1 billion versus the 7 billion or 8 billion you see the opportunity in front of us. And the biggest opportunity in the short run is, as I said earlier is to go after those great Quest accounts, we will do that early, but this is why we believe that this affords us a nice growth opportunity, not just for 2019, but for 2020 and 2021 because it’s going to take some time to gain that share and move that work away from the more expensive labs, and this is true for United, but I will also argue, we will be doing this with other health plans as well. So, it’s an opportunity to continue to pick up share. So, we will again be coming back together in November, we'll help – provide more visibility to what we believe the opportunity would be within reason, but hopefully at least those remarks will help you kind of size the opportunity in front of us given where we sit today.
Mark Guinan: And Ricky, it's a little more complicated being with United and Quest because we had some in network volumes. So, as we shared historically, in our pathology business, we had a couple of states that have been in in-network. And then obviously if you're trying to look at a model for out of network labs' share within large national payers, the fact that it's such a strong business of United a decade ago, we never lost all of that because of the loyalty of some of the providers, and the fact that they could look even out of network, our prices were still better than hospitals and many others. So, it's a little bit different than if you want to look at other payers and say, hey, how much volume is there out of network. I think Quest had a disproportionate share of volume relative to what other labs might have out of network, but it's still not huge because you are an out of network provider, certainly when they have only insured patients, we don't get paid at all. So, it's really only their administered plans when they have out-of-network benefits where it makes sense for us to keep that volume and continue to try to compete.
Ricky Goldwasser: Understood. So, just as a follow-up, and I understand that you had more share than a typical out of network, but it would be really helpful for us if you can give us a data point for a typical out of network is, at least it will help us establish a floor from which you can build on. That's one. And then the second question that I had is regarding the acquisitions, can you remind us how long does it take for an acquisition to reach company margin? And if you can quantify what was the negative impact on margin from acquisition integration?
Mark Guinan: So, let me answer the acquisition question. We've shared in the past 12 to 18 months. I'd say on the outreach purchases, they tend to happen a lot more quickly. They're more simple and straightforward. It's really just integrating them into our local laboratory, and then the cost of serving those patients is basically the cost of serving all the other patients we currently do in those markets. So, those might even happen a little quicker in the 6 to 12-month window. And some of these other, I'll call them technology acquisitions, and that could involve site shutdown, it could involve moving the test menu to multiple locations. Obviously, it's working through the sales force issues, reimbursement issues and so on and so forth. So, those tend to be on the longer end, and you'll notice that number of the deals that we did in the latter part of 2017 were more like that as opposed to outreach purchases. So, we take a little bit longer. And then on the volume question, Ricky, I know you'd like some great specificity. All I can share is that typically there is a tiny share for an out of network lab in terms of their share of volume within a national payer and we were not tiny, but we certainly were not large.
Steve Rusckowski: And just on the acquisition, remember, we had this feathering going on that we have a nice slug of acquisitions in 2018. We're again giving you some perspective on the outlook that we have for 2019. The acquisitions would definitely be in that 1% to 2%. Those 2018 acquisitions, another year under their belt, 2019 where we get some of the integration done that helps us, and you layer that on top of the new acquisitions we bring in 2019. But we're hopeful we have a more regular cadence around that 1% to 2% that you already see in our numbers. So, as they come in, they take some time to mature with the integration coupled with the ones that are just showing up, that's already in our numbers for past years as well.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Lisa.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Lisa.
Steve Rusckowski: Lisa, we can't hear you.
Lisa Gill: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Thank you for all the detail. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. You've talked a lot about revenue growth as we think about 2019, you talked about having EPS growth. When we think about some of the efficiency gains that you think about in 2019 and beyond, how does the retail strategy fit into that? Can you remind us if that is more economically better for Quest versus your own patient service centers? And two, are you seeing incremental test volume through that? I just want to better understand how you're thinking about the retail setting as we think about 2019, 2020 and beyond.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, what we said about the retail strategy, it's a better location in these sites. So, it serves our patients in the market better and therefore it's beneficial to the patients, it's beneficial to our employees, and our partners. In one case, it's Safeway; in the other case, it's Walmart are happy as well. Now, with all that, we've shared in the past, from a rent perspective, the cost of using that space, there is not a big difference between the two. However, we're getting much better space. Many of our patient service centers that we could collapse or patient service centers with one or two phlebotomists. This affords us an opportunity to take down those locations and put them into a better location, and that's better again for all stakeholders. And so, it's not a cost savings, but what it provides us is a better quality and better patient experience. And what I said in my remarks, what we do now have enough data points where we look six months of what we close versus what we open, we believe the volumes are better in those locations. So, it is positive financially for us and it's one of the ingredients of us gaining share. Now, we said, again, this is for our core business. We also believe this is an opportunity for us, particularly with the Walmart JV to tag on to those physical locations more healthcare services that we'll be working with Walmart, with local partners to be able to bend the cost curve for whatever partner we're working with. So that just affords us another opportunity beyond our core diagnostic service business. So, hopefully that's helpful.
Mark Guinan: Yes. And just to add, we have shared in the past that in Safeway, because we've leveraged some of the overhead, there is some cost savings, the greatest cost is the phlebotomists and that doesn't change when we go into a retail setting, but there is some cost savings despite the fact that the rents generally is somewhat comparable, smaller space, higher rates for more attractive market, but the overall footprint costs us relatively the same. But this is a business with small details. So, little bit of cost savings combined with, as Steve mentioned, some volume upside certainly can make a difference, especially as we continue to expand. And then Walmart is a JV. So, it is different. It's not just putting a phlebotomist draw center within a retail outlet versus one of our independent patient service centers, and what we are starting with phlebotomy, we are definitely intending to add more healthcare services together with Walmart to build their presence within the healthcare. And it is a JV. So, therefore we've got a majority position to who are going to be sharing the economic value creation of that venture with Walmart.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Donald Hooker: Great. Yes. I'll just ask one real quick question here. Maybe just a little bit more elaboration on the M&A environment. I know you guys target 100 to 200 basis points of inorganic growth annually. It sounded like from your comments, just to clarify, you are already there for next year. And we still have obviously a lot of time. So, maybe kind of an update on your acquisition pipeline. Is there potential for you to potentially exceed that 200 basis points of growth next year? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So, what we said is what we've announced so far, puts us in that 1% to 2%, which, you know it is a good place to be at this point. We also said that given the environment and given the pressure that we see on hospital outreach operations, we think that's a catalyst to afford us a nice pipeline. We just announced another deal of buying an outreach business this week, an outreach activity called out of the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, and there will be more to come. So, yes, we will share this point 1% to 2%. We're comfortably there for next year, but we do have a funnel that can add to that going into 2019.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. Hi. So, two quick questions. One, obviously in 2019, you said you expect top line in EPS growth and that is in the face of 200 basis points of, I guess, incremental pricing pressure. Can you let us know how much market share gain from the UNH contract and some of the Aetna loss you're assuming in that to get to that? And I guess my second question would be around cash flow and share repurchase. Obviously, your stock is very weak today, but it's been down since the last earnings when you had to reduce guidance slightly. You have a great balance, you did enhance cash flow. I guess, at what point will you go into the market and do some incremental share repurchase? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Sure, Ann. So, first off, let me clarify. We don't have an incremental 250 basis points of price going into next year. What we talked about was a total of 250 versus something that's more in the lines of 150 this year. So, I want to make sure that I'm clear on that. And about 50 basis points of the increased pricing pressure is PAMA related and the other 50 basis points related to other things. In terms of share, obviously we don't get into that level of detail. We're very cognizant of the need to retain our Aetna business. We've got people who have been actively working for the last several months. We continue to work to make sure that we serve those customers appropriately and we retain as much of that Aetna business as possible and certainly have United, as we mentioned earlier. We're very excited about the opportunity. Steve mentioned, we expect that in some of these very loyalist accounts who would be sending us to United, if we were in network and would have been sending it to us, we'll flip very quickly. There are those accounts that have multiple providers and we believe together with our value proposition, all the things we've walked through, which does differentiate us from almost all the other providers in a meaningful way around the patient experience, with our app, with certainly the pricing transparency, which is a huge win-win for the physician and the patients to be able to go into one of our draw centers at no upfront, whether something is covered and how much of cost, it’s just there aren't many labs that can do that. And therefore the –argument around simplicity, why we want to do business with multiple labs, you got five or six labs you're sending work through today, we could do almost all that if not all of that, we've got more lives covered in a given geography. So, you don't have to worry about problems with the patients for the high cost out of network work. And we think that's pretty compelling, but that's not going to happen as quickly as the first piece. And then obviously the third piece is where we don't have business today. So, now we feel very strong with that same value proposition that we can go in and we can compete more strongly than we could have in the past and flip some of those accounts where we may not have any or very much work at all. So, that's going to take even longer. So, this is a multi-year growth opportunity. It's not all about 2019, and we have plans in place and we have strategies to go after each of those, and we're working hard to make sure that that all comes. So, certainly excited about that and very confident about that.
Shawn Bevec: And just to clarify, that incremental 50 basis points of price pressure next year outside of PAMA, that's primarily going to be coming from the United price headwinds.
Ann Hynes: Okay. So, the total incremental is 50 or 100?
Steve Rusckowski: 100.
Shawn Bevec: 50 from PAMA and 50 from primarily United.
Ann Hynes: Okay. And just on share repurchase question, please.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, obviously I can't talk about any specific plans around share repurchases, but given the fact that we have announced and are closing a number of transactions this quarter, we're going to be spending a fair amount of cash on those deals and we certainly are excited about the pipeline coming up. So, at this point, we haven't announced anything specific. We'll continue to follow our strategy, which says with half of our free cash flow that's not committed to our shareholders every year, we're going to make situational decisions depending on the M&A opportunities and the attractiveness of those returns versus share repurchases.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi, good morning. Mark, just a quick question on United. Thanks for all that color. So, as we think about 2019, putting it all together, out of network, going in network and then the volume expectations that you have in the ramp, is United a net positive revenue contributor in 2019?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, absolutely.
Brian Tanquilut: Okay. Got it. Alright. Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Kevin Ellich: Hi, guys. Just …
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Kevin Ellich: With the strong M&A pipeline, hi Steve, given what you've done, do you have any, I guess, strategic focus at things that you'd like to add, Steve as we think about your pipeline?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Continue with what we've been focused on. One is, the opportunity to run hospital outreach. We think it's a – of course it's a nice opportunity to continue to consolidate the market and we do believe that we'll continue to build. And as I said, we just announced another deal this week. Number two, you saw that we just announced a number of acquisitions that afford us new capabilities. The Immunotec acquisition gives us blood tuberculosis testing capability with tick-borne capabilities. That was a nice add. ReproSource gives us nice women's health capability and then we also talk about PhenoPath up in the Pacific Northwest that has some capabilities around pathology and molecular. So, we'll always look for new capabilities. And then the third piece is, there's still regional laboratories that we believe we are going to have difficult times than – more difficult time than hospital outreach, and you'll see some regional opportunities. So, if you look back in the last five years and you look at the acquisitions, they fit in those three categories. There's been ebbs and flows of each of the three, but generally, that's what we continue to look and they're all strategically aligned to what we do and we have to have a path to value creation and hopefully you agree with us that we've built up credibility around that. So, we will continue to work on that and go into next year. We already hit that 1% to 2%, and we've got a nice funnel to continue to pursue ideas that we can make money of.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. Just one final one on the UnitedHealth volume opportunity. I think previously you talked about some potential increased volumes flipping into 2018. Is that something you're contemplating in your guidance for the year or no?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, there is certainly some early transitions. It's not significant enough to call out, but I didn't want you to think we're waiving on everything till January 1. So yes, we absolutely already have some accounts that have moved and some accounts that are committing to move, but at this point, it's still relatively small.
Dan Leonard: Okay. Thank you.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, last question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Hi, thanks. Most of mine have been covered, but there is one in your footnotes, which is, obviously M&A is a big piece of the call today and I'm seeing that you're writing off the fair value contingent consideration on MedXM. I'm just curious if we can get an update on that acquisition and then maybe just kind of a broader swath on how other acquisitions have been doing. You've announced quite a few here in the last few months. Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, we're happy with MedXM. As I'm sure you're familiar, the reason you put in an earnout into a deal was when the buyer and the seller have markedly different views of the potential, it's one way to get two transactions coined that shares the risk appropriately. So, at this point, not quite 9 months into the acquisition, we feel from an accounting standpoint that it's highly unlikely to pay out the earnout. That doesn't mean that we haven't achieved what we were expecting to achieve. It just means that the seller had a very different view of where that might go. And so that's all you should read into there. We're very happy with MedXM thus far. It's been a great addition to our portfolio, and I can tell you that as we're talking to payers about our laboratory testing, this is another opportunity to talk to them about ways that we can really help them beyond just the laboratory testing we're doing with great reach and population health and so on. So, it's another point why they want to do business with Quest.
Eric Coldwell: That's great. Thanks very much.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. I think we've handled all the questions. We thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your support. You have a great day and hope to see many of you at our Investor Day in November.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018, and were adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I’ll provide you with the highlights on the quarter and review progress on our 2-point strategy, which continues to drive results. And then Mark will provide more detail on second quarter performance. The highlight of the quarter was establishing, our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare, I’ll share more on this relationship in a few minutes. We delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter driven by revenue growth and the benefits of tax reform. Here are some key highlights from the quarters; revenues were up 3%, despite some headwinds in the marketplace, reported EPS was up more than 14% from 2017, the adjusted EPS grew more than 20%. Before I describe the progress we’ve made, I like to provide an update on PAMA. We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule. On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS, and both sides have submitted their briefs to the court, we’re awaiting the judge to rule on the briefs or set the date to hear or oral arguments. In the meantime, we continue our outreach efforts to find the legislative solution. Earlier this month we were pleased to learn that CMS is asking stakeholders to provide comments and also improve future data collection and reporting periods on their PAMA. This is a proper step since as we said all along, PAMA’s current reporting requirements undermine any effort to establish a sustainable market-based PAMA model and deliver the care that patients need. But the key will be what CMS does with the requested comments. And moreover the need for change is now. Changing data collection for the future reported periods does not undo the harm caused by the flawed data collection process that was used in connection with establishing the current rates. Turning to the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. We completed our previously announced acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare in Massachusetts the leading provider of healthcare services for residents and visitors of Cape Cod. Our integration efforts from acquisitions completed in 2017, continue to drive revenue growth and our M&A pipeline remain strong. As we continued our conversations with hospital system CEO’s from around the country, it’s clear from those discussion there is a growing awareness of PAMA and the impact it has on their outreach laboratory business. CEO’s are increasingly interested in talking more about how we can help them execute their last strategy. As you recall, this can involve improving their hospital lab operations, working with us on reference testing and potentially selling their outreach laboratory business to us. In addition to PAMA, hospital CEO’s are also seeing the trend in health plans like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare partnering with high value providers like Quest to reduce laboratory spend and bring down the cost of care. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. In May we announced our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare beginning on January 1, 2019, plus we’ll be participating as a national provider of laboratory services for all UnitedHealthcare plan participants. We’re excited about this partnership, as it includes a broad range of value-based programs rewarding high quality, easily accessible laboratory services at the best value and real-time data sharing to drive more personalized health. We’re positioning ourselves to be well prepared to provide UnitedHealthcare members with a first-class customer experience. Our commercial team has already begun proactively reaching out to physician and customers to let to know, we’ll be in that work with UnitedHealthcare on January 1. Additionally, we’ll be fielding inquiries from customers who are committed to selling us an increasingly share of their UnitedHealthcare patient specimens in 2019. We’re delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON, tuberculosis test, noninvasive prenatal screening. In the second quarter, we did experience three dynamics which impacted the marketplace. First, the growth we saw in prescription drug monitoring marketplace although strong, it was less than expected because of policy changes opposed by some payers to limit testing. We’re engaging directly with these payers to show the medical necessity of this testing and so far have had success getting at least one payer to reverse its policy change. Second, in the hepatitis C market, we saw a faster than expected decline in genotyping and resistance testing. This was largely due to the rapid acceptance, so that these new hepatitis C therapy which works across multiple genes and does not require the same level of testing as previous therapies. We still see a tremendous opportunity in hepatitis C screening. Our screening business continues to grow and we estimate two-thirds of more than 70 million baby boomers still have yet to be screened. Finally on vitamin D testing, it did slow the quarter due to increased reimbursement denials. We’re working with payers and providers to ensure the appropriate testing is being performed for patients who need it. We continue to make strong progress, executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and the well received by customers. We’re now operating in 12 Walmart locations in Florida and Texas and we’ll be providing more around our consumer strategies including MyQuest, our digital experience and our consumer offering at our Investor Day in November. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. I’m excited about last month’s launch of Quest Clinical Trial Connect a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and sterile to speed the development of new therapies. We have already engaged several pharma, biotech and sterile companies with this solution. In the area of population health in June, we released a study on employer wellness and screening at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Session showing a strong association between wellness participation and healthcare outcomes. The study showed that a third of the at-risk employees identified by screen who then participated in a behavioural health program to reduce diabetes risk, reduce glucose and hemoglobin A1c to normal levels. Also more than one-quarter participants lost 5% or more of body weight reducing the risk of many of BCD related conditions. This news is catching the attentions of both employers and health plans as they proactively look for opportunities to vendor healthcare cost curve. We’re strengthening already strong position in the marketplace. The second element of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We’re continued to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. I referenced to digitize our processes are improving the customer experience. So here are two simple real examples of improving opportunities in front of us. First, as we shared previously, processing a paper requisition takes approximately 4 minutes, the enablement allows us to improve both efficiency and quality. We’re making progress in our efforts to get clients systemic, electronic requisitions today more than 70% of the requisitions we received are sent electronically and this is up from approximately 60% in 2016. Second, we have developed a client from lead application, which allows physicians and their staffs to order specimen pickups. Since the launch of early last year over 5,000 clients have converted to online tick up through what we call, Quanum HCP Portal and we’re adding 200 clients each week. Each day more than 13% of routine on-demand, pick up requests are received electronically through our new application. And we expect this rapid adoption will continue. Well this translates into – if you recall to our call centre in a significant fewer occurrences of our couriers arriving to find an empty lot box. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who’ll take you through the financial performance. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.92 billion were up 3% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of bad debt due to a change in revenue recognition accounting. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew 3.3% compared to the prior year, driven largely by acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.5% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 200 basis points. Volume was softer than expected due in large part to the specific market dynamics highlighted by Steve earlier. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. During the second quarter, unit prices headwinds remain consistent with those observed in the first quarter with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. After netting changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds. Reported operating income for the quarter was $305 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $319 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $340 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $343 million or 18.4% of revenues last year. The decline in operating margin was due to several factors including investments using tax reform savings that had a 60 basis point adverse impact on operating margin, some of our larger acquisitions which are in the early stages of integration and therefore not yet delivering full margin and contribution and PAMA. Reported EPS was $1.57 in the quarter compared to $1.37 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 up more than 20% from $1.45 last year. During the quarter uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we now call patient price concessions were flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations year-to-date was $503 million versus $490 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $151 million compared to $107 million a year ago, which is in line with a higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now turning to guidance. We are narrowing our outlook for 2018 as follows; revenues now expected to be between $7.7 billion and $7.74 billion an increase of 4% to 4.5% versus the prior year; reported diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.64; and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.67; cash provided by operation continues to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million. In addition, keep in mind that the investments in the business we are making related to tax reform savings will continue to ramp up as we progress throughout the remainder of 2018. Some of these investments are related to preparing to be a national in network provider for UnitedHealthcare. Our narrowed revenue guidance reflects our performance through the first half. As you think about the second half of the year consider the following; first, the actions we are taking in the areas of PDM and vitamin D testing; second, as Steve mentioned health systems are talking to us more about how we can help them execute their lab strategy. We have a few professional lab services agreements we expect to close in the second half. Taken together we expect the benefit of these items will build as we progress through the remainder of the year. Finally, last year severe hurricane impacts should make for an easier comparison this year. The majority of the impact was in the third quarter with some carryover in the fourth quarter as well. To sum it up, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the second half and remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2018 outlook. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. And to summarize, we grew revenues and delivered strong earnings in the second quarter. We’re excited to build on the strategic relationship that we now have with UnitedHealthcare Group. And we remain focused on executing our 2-point strategy and we are confident, we’ll meet our commitments for the remainder of 2018. Now we’d be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: How are you?
Steve Rusckowski: Good.
Patrick Donnelly: When we think about the shifting payer contracts to nonexclusive, can you just talk through your initial discussions with United ahead of the contract opening up in January? How quickly you think you can capture share? And then just from the outside, what are the key dynamics to understand around the ramp up of business and your focus points going into January?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. When we had launched the new relationship, we talked about the opportunities that have access to over 40 million lives. And we’ve already started, and we’ve started working on this aggressively. So we have detailed out by thousands of accounts which sales reps and which geographies will engage with customers. First of all, making them aware of the contractual changes, talk about what we need to do to potentially serve them in a broader way. And finally is, to be prepared to ramp this up as quickly as possible. And so what I will share with you is we’ve already left the blocks, we’re off and running. We’re engaging with customers throughout the United States. The receptivity of this is quite good. They’re waiting for someone for some time for us to be back on contract. And the biggest opportunity for us is, for those accounts that might have another laboratory because we were not contract with United, now have an opportunity to continue to bring us more of their laboratory services work. And then second is, we have an opportunity just broadly in many accounts to gain more share. So we’re optimistic about it and working hard at it.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. That’s helpful. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, pretty light quarter in terms of M&A activity, can you just update us what you are seeing in the market. Are things developing slower than you anticipate around PAMA driving consolidation or is it more just around the processes inside the hospitals taking a long time to get deal consummated.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Patrick, just to underscore my comments, the conversations have increased. We’re engaged in many more conversations today with CEO’s of integrated delivery systems around their lab strategy. And in that regard, they are considering given what’s happening with PAMA and given the change they see happening with health plans, for what they – should they going forward with their outreach business if they have it. So we’re optimistic by the prospect. Again, there’s three parts of our strategy. First is what we call professional laboratory services business. As Mark said, we’ve got a few opportunities in front of us. We’re hopeful in the back half to be announcing a couple of these at least. Second is, it affords us an opportunity to do more other sophisticated testing, which we call reference testing in the hospitals. And usually, when we have those conversations, we then have a conversation around outreach. So there’s more conversation today than a year ago in that funnel and that whole opportunity list continues to build for us.
Shawn Bevec: Operator, next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hey, good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Ricky Goldwasser: So first of all, a point of clarification. When we think about the guidance for second half of the year, does that incorporate continued weakness with drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D?
Mark Guinan: So Ricky, the hep C impact, we don’t expect to be reversed. So that is kind of a permanent change. So we’ll continue to have some headwinds on that particular part of hep C. But as Steve mentioned, screening continues to grow. So it’s still an attractive business, it’s just that the genotypic testing, which is largely going to go away. So continued headwinds on hep C but certainly, mitigating because there will be some business that obviously will remain in other drugs that do require that testing. On the prescription drug monitoring, we mentioned that we’ve got one payer who changed their position. We are well down the road in discussing that with a couple of other payers who made those changes. We’re optimistic because we think that our view is the medically appropriate approach to this very necessary important area of testing. So we have some plans in place, and we’re counting on not just the one payer being reversed, but there are couple of others we’re feeling like we’re making progress in that space. And then on vitamin D, it’s really a market that has probably not always been coded appropriately. There’s changes in vitamin D that make a lot of people eligible for vitamin D testing. And there’s some practices where people are still using old coding, not understanding that it’s going to have an impact on the providers. So I think there is an increasing education around the appropriate use of vitamin D testing, which, of course, we support but then ensuring that you coded accurately as well to ensure that the providers could pay. So we’re optimistic that some of that will be mitigated as well. And over time, and that’s why we talked about increasing momentum throughout the back half of the year.
Steve Rusckowski: So the guidance for the full year does contemplating, obviously, what happened in the first half but what we will address for these three issues that we talked about in our remarks in the second half as well. So yes, it’s in.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay, great. And then two thoughts here. First of all, when we think about a step up in SG&A investment in preparation for bringing on the United volume, should we think about that as incremental to the $75 million in investment that are related to tax reform savings that you talked about in the past? And should we think about this as a new SG&A base that will carry over for 2019 or do you just onetime investments? And then the second thought is just on unit price. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the mix versus the unit price headwinds and you mentioned that 2019 reimbursement pressure will accelerate on the unit price. I know it’s a little bit early, but how should we think about the mix versus the unit price in 2019?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So thank you for the questions. First off, the investments that we talked about ramping up are included in that $75 million. So it’s not incremental from the $75 million we talked about. We, in the beginning of the year, we talked about a portion of that being invested in our people in that $500 onetime bonus. We talked about some investments in the areas of accelerated growth, around advanced diagnostics and PBM. Well we didn’t talk about the third piece and we couldn’t because that was really earmarked for United. So it’s still all contained within the initial $75 million we talked about. And then importantly, it’s not all SG&A. A large portion of it is actually cost of sales. And its investment before the volume comes, but then once the volume comes, it’s just cost of sales. So as we add incremental to draw centers incremental phlebotomist, couriers and laboratory tax ahead of that volume to ensure we’re fully prepared for what we expect to come its in investments. But then over time, obviously, it’s just the normal support you need to deliver our business. And then in terms of 2019, Ricky, I’m not yet going to give any guidance for 2019. But I can assure you that when we gave the multiyear outlook when I presented in 2016 and we reaffirmed when PAMA was announced last fall, that all of that is contemplated. So we’ll give you more granularity on that – on all those pieces at the Investor Day later in the year.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Amanda.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Max on for Amanda. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Just wanted to follow-up a little bit around some unit price headwinds, I know you mentioned the other 50 basis point headwinds from PAMA and 100 basis points from other factors. Can now we speak around what exactly those other factors are. How transitory do you think those factors are going to be moving forward? And that maybe also just some additional context around the benefits from mix in the quarter in terms of how much that contributed?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So the – we didn’t say it was 100. To clarify, it’s less than 100. So that’s kind of in the normal course of the last couple of years of some of the nongovernmental pricing headwinds that we’ve had. And it has to do with any other part of our business, whether it’s extending third-party commercial contracts, whether it’s the direct business in which we compete through hospital reference testing, or it can even be in the stage where it’s permitted where we are actually billing physicians directly as a client who then mark up that work and then bill it to the third-party. So we have certainly competition amongst all these areas and while we’ve certainly turned the tide of where pricing was some years ago, as we said, there’s still some degree of headwinds in the balance of our business. And that’s generally going somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points over the last several years quarter-to-quarter and continues to be less than 100 basis points. And we mentioned that when you take price and all the mix elements together, with favorable revenue per req of 20 basis points. So obviously with 50 basis points of PAMA, somewhere south of 100 basis points on other pricing, we have significantly lift from the other mix elements. And then finally, we’ve talked about professional laboratory services, which is an increasing part of our growth. It is a business that has lower revenue per req because of the unique nature of what it is. It’s basic testing done for hospital in-patients, where typically, we have fewer tests per req and more basic testing. We’re not doing advanced diagnostics in that business and so on. So revenue per req tends to be lower and so that creates the mixed headwinds, it’s math in terms of our revenue per req. It doesn’t in anyway speak to its profitability. It’s still a very attractive, profitable business. It just has a low req volume and more basic routine testing.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Just to reiterate something we always say, and Mark said in his prepared remarks, we do this calculation on revenue per requisition. But really, when you get into managing the business and understanding how that eventually yields margins, there’s a lot of other considerations. Some of this lower revenue per req business actually BNP more profitable than higher req – higher dollar per requisition. So it’s not necessarily a surrogate for margins at all, so something to keep in mind. So in the quarter, we improved our revenue per requisition by 20 basis points, but you saw our margin were quite good in consideration for what we had to do with a lot of the different moving pieces, as Mark outlined.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Appreciate the color on that. And following-up on a little bit of a related note. We saw a little over a week ago with the preliminary physician rule that CMS has proposed, tweaked a few thresholds to define what’s an applicable lab for reporting purposes. Just wondered if there’s been any discussions around what the implications could be of this internally or externally as you continue to adopt PAMA here in 2018?
Steve Rusckowski: As I said in my prepared remarks, we’re encouraged that they’re asking us for input related to how to improve the data reporting. Albeit, we still believe what they did with the current Clinical Lab Fee Schedule was wrong and that needs to be corrected and we’re challenging CMS in that regard. Prospective, we do need to get it right. We are pursuing a legislative solution to that. And we’re engaging, as we have all along, with CMS, on how we conclude more labs and how do we get the statistics to really reflective of the market-based approach to laboratory services. So we’re encouraged by that. Second, on the physician fee schedule there will be modest tweaks in that. We think it’s for 2019 not necessarily that notable for our business. That was a small piece of our anatomic pathology business that had billed that way. But nothing that’s material for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse. You may ask your question.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. First all, just cleanup questions from previous ones. Is there any way that we can quantify the headwind you saw from the drug testing hep C, vitamin D in terms of maybe percentage headwind that represented?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So we have been at a pretty steady rate of organic improvements in organic growth over the last number of quarters. And then obviously, we’ve fallen back from that. Really, the things that we talked about are really the primary drivers of that difference, A.J. So I’m not going to give a specific number. What I would say is those are the reconciliation between kind of the run rate organic performance we’ve been delivering consistently and what we delivered in the second quarter.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So we outlined the three areas A.J., in the remarks. And if you look at the issues that we saw reflect what we thought we could have done versus what we really did do. So those three, we will quantify exactly of the three buckets the total will be broken down from. But they do outline the difference between expectations to the market, our expectations and what we actually delivered.
A.J. Rice: Okay. And then my follow-up…
Steve Rusckowski: Now with that said, we are taking actions for a few of those to reverse it in Q3 and Q4. We mentioned the work we’re doing with payers on the prescription drug monitoring, the work we’re doing with payers around vitamin D. As Mark said, the hep C care business, which is the genotyping and resistance testing business will essentially slow down because it’s no longer needed to give the new therapy for AbbVie. But the screening business continues to be a big opportunity and there’s plenty of baby boomers left that need to be screened. So even though it did slow in the quarter, we’re working on things to reverse that in the second half.
A.J. Rice: Okay. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask you about a couple of growth opportunities. We talk a lot about United, Optum is in the process of buying DaVita Medical Group. I know lots of that medical group practice that volume tends to go to you. Have you look at opportunity that might present for you and given any sizing of that? And then is there any update on your work with HCA, I know about a year, 1.5 years ago, you started working with them in Denver and the idea was just sort of exploring opportunities and that could extend. Any update on those– that discussion?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So first of all, on Optum, when we talked about our relationship with UnitedHealthcare group, it’s well. We currently are now back in network in 2019 with UHC as an in-network provider laboratory services. That’s big. As you know, we have partnered with them on revenue cycle management. We’re one of their biggest customers. Third is, we provide wellness services for Optum. So we are their somewhat exclusive provider of wellness services for OptumCare when they sell those to payers. Also, we’re – they’re becoming one of our biggest customers. To your specific question in OptumCare, as you said, their buying physicians and they’re buying many of our existing customers. And the opportunity to beat up the physician business supports yet another opportunity. So if that closes, they’ll be close to – they have close to 50,000 physicians, and we’re actively working with them on how we can better serve all their physicians, the existing accounts but also growing – their growing list of physicians in OptumCare. So this relationship continues to build, and we see a good growth prospect of building a bigger and better relationship with OptumCare as they consolidate those practices into their business going forward. Second part of the question…
Mark Guinan: On HCA.
Steve Rusckowski: HCA. The Denver opportunity which is called the continental division is going well. We’re optimistic that we can leverage that relationship throughout the rest of HCA. We continue to work that. And as Mark said, there will be more professional laboratory services relationships announced in the second half. So stay posted.
Mark Guinan: Yes. I would just add, A.J., and certainly you can ask them, but I’m very confident they would tell you that we’ve delivered the quality and the cost savings that they were looking for target up front. So now, of course, the question is what does that mean? Could it mean we expand to other sites? I would think, at the point in time, if we have something to announce, we are happy to announce it. But I think the good news is that both parties are happy with what was delivered and it’s worked out very well.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Jack Meehan: Hey, good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning.
Jack Meehan: My first question, I was curious if you could weigh in on the Women’s Health Business in the quarter? I think there was some impact in the first quarter from the weather and the flu. Just what were some of the trends you were seeing in the second quarter there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. First of all, as we’ve mentioned in our remarks, the prenatal testing business continues to grow nicely. So we’re optimistic about that. Second is if you look at just ongoing activity, and we’ve showed this many, many times, if you look at our existing accounts and we do the same account or same-store analysis. And if you look at activity within those accounts that we know we have, we haven’t lost any share. I would say, just in general the market’s stable. And I would say, just in general, that’s true for let’s just call it the more routine portion of our Women’s Health business. We continue Jack to see a continuation of the slow decline in our path business. The change in practice guidelines back in 2013 did affect the marketplace, where women in the past used to go annually for their check, that’s happening less frequently and that continues to be phased in, even though it’s been about five years. But just in general, the general volume from our Women’s Health business continues to be stable.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then I had two follow-ups on capital deployment. I caught M&A added 2% of volume, what was the total revenue contribution? And then on share repurchase, I think this is the first quarter with no repurchase since 2011. So just if you could give any color on what you think the pacing is from here and why no repurchase in the quarter?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So the contribution from M&A was similar, so there wasn’t a big difference. Obviously what we’re buying, Jack, is a business that’s very similar to our core business. So you wouldn’t see a tremendous mix difference that are differential between the volume and revenue contribution.
Jack Meehan: And then on share repurchase.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So share repurchases, we actually were quiet in the quarter. We stepped out of the market due to what we thought was the impending announcement of UnitedHealthcare. So going forward, as we said, we’re going to do the minimal level to meet our 50% or at least half commitment of cash returned to our – or free cash flow returned to our shareholders. Certainly, you should expect that level of activity. But any other share repurchases would be dependent on the amount of M&A activity we have in the back half.
Jack Meehan: Great. Thank you, Mark and Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Jack.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may ask your question.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good morning guys.
Mark Guinan: Hey, Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: Steve, so I guess, as I think about the recent rule that came out of CMS, the rule proposal, and how they’re still viewing, obviously, PAMA as excluding the hospitals. How do you – assuming that holds, right? How do you view the recent changes in manage your contracting, with you getting to United, and LabCorp getting to Aetna? How does that impact the repricing of PAMA a few years down the road?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, what they used, Brian, for the majority of the data points for what we got in a refresh of a clinical fee schedule, the vast majority of the data points were from the two large nationals. So that was what was used. And we think that was incredibly flawed in its approach. Imagine what CMS buys from all the laboratories they buy it from thousands of laboratories, roughly 20% of what they buy is from the nationals. So the date they collected was a distortion of what they really buy. And so this is one of the biggest points we have. They got to collect more data from more laboratories. And as you know, there’s wide variation in this marketplace and the best value is from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So that was the data they collected. We’re hopeful. Given this current request for more data, now they can collect more data. The advocacy by asking the question, they got it wrong and they need to get it right the next time they collected data. And again, we’re challenging what they did in the first time around lawsuit. It’s still in the court. We’re hopeful that, that will progress, and we’ll have a favorable consideration there. But in parallel with that, we’re also looking for a legislative solution. So we’re currently continue to work this because we believe, at its core, the refreshed clinical – the lab fee schedule was done wrongly. But given all that, what we’ve outlined in our guidance for this year, what we’ve outlined in our outlook for 2019 and 2020 is assuming worst case. That is if this sticks and it continues to be the case then that in fact will be what we’ll absorb, and we will be able to manage the business and hit our outlook despite it. So hopefully, we’ll have better news in that regard, but we’re assuming the worst case. And then into the future, yes, there will be data points gathered from payers. But again, hopefully there’ll be more laboratories included in data collection process, so therefore, that will move the needle quite a bit. So hopefully, that answers your question.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So let me just quickly comment, Brian, on its impact on PAMA. So as we shared, we’re very vocal with all the payers, not just getting United, and I certainly can’t speak for our competitor. But I can tell you that when we go in there and say, hey, now there’s full transparency. We know where the weighted volume median is amongst the national provider, we know we provide the best prices. And the fact that you already get the best prices from us and that we’re going to be paying for potentially twice, with PAMA, means like you’re not getting any better prices. And if anything, it’s an opportunity – it has been opportunity for us to talk about getting paid for more because these are getting paid more because they think we paid a little bit more than we have been recently or historically, it’s still a less better value than the majority of the people they’re paying. And in fact, in the United contract, when we talk about value-based contracting, as we move volume away from those high-cost providers, part of the contract is what you’d call a bonus rate. So basically, we share the savings with our partner and that will ensure that as we’re saving the healthcare system patients and the payers all money that it doesn’t damage us from a PAMA perspective, but actually, it should be neutral to positive depending on how we’re performing and where that volume growth comes from.
Brian Tanquilut: No. I appreciate that. And I guess the follow-up to that is as we think about the networks built around United and Aetna, how do you think about the pace of market share shift? Not necessarily from your national competitor but from the regional’s. What is that opportunity and how hard of a lift or how heavy of a lift is that?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, that’s the opportunity in front of us, this relationship with United, and we we’re having conversations with all the payers. Despite the two nationals having strong presence, there’s still an opportunity to pick up share for the rest of the marketplace. We talk about the opportunity, when we talk about United, you have roughly more than 40 million lives, you go quickly through the mathematics of that. We basically have shared that their spend – laboratory spend is north of $7 billion in that regard. If you look at the two large nationals, it’s still a minority. It’s still the opportunity given the trend in general in healthcare is to move more of those higher cost, more expensive laboratory volumes to us. And so what we’re detailing right now is precisely that. We’re knocking on the doors of many – thousands of customers, Brian. And they have many laboratories and many of those laboratories aren’t the two large nationals, but there are many others. And in some cases, they have those laboratories because we were not in network with United. They no longer need those laboratories to serve them and therefore, those supporters are big opportunities. So we need to think about this not just between us and the other large national but more importantly, the opportunity to really continue to gain share, particularly for the regional portion of this market.
Brian Tanquilut: I appreciate. Thanks Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thanks and good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. In your prepared comments, when talking about United, you talked about value-based program. When we think about the contracting for the new relationship, is it a traditional lab relationship when we think about being paid for the req? Or are you seeing changes in the way that your contracting around value-based programs? That’s my first question. And then secondly, if that’s not the case, can you help us understand what some of the opportunities are around value-based programs, especially with United and Aetna as you think about the new contracts?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Lisa, it is a traditional relationship. We’re paid for activity. Generally, obviously, there’s some portions where they’re fully insured where they have an HMO plan. But for the most part, this is a traditional fee-for-service contract. The difference is that the rate is variable dependent on our performance. So when we talk about value-based contracting, and as I referenced earlier, there is incentive payments that we can earn by saving the money. When I say saving them, I’m talking about not just the United but obviously, the healthcare system and especially the patient. So there’s an awful lot of work going to high-cost providers. Some of it’s because they have significantly higher prices. So we’ve talked about hospitals and physician-owned laboratories but even some regional players. The other thing is that the payers are becoming increasingly aware that we don’t all conduct ourselves in the same way. So price is one thing but the level of activity for a patient with for a patient with a given condition is also a driver. So you can have some labs that might have lower pricing with same pricing as we do but they’re actually charging more because there’s more activity for a given condition. So really, the focus around what is the total cost per interaction with a patient in saving money on that by doing things medically appropriate at a good price. And to the extent that, that saves money for the system and overall stakeholder, some of that will come back to us. So there’s incentives for us. A lot more detail will come down the road. We believe that, around the middle of next year or maybe a little ahead of that, United will talk about their preferred network and what some of the conditions are to be a preferred provider. But also some of the structures, including things that we are hopeful about including planned benefit design, where there is actually incentives for patients and others in the decision process financially to drive things towards that preferred network because that preferred network will be at the highest quality and the best value of any of the options within the network. So that’s about what we can share right now. And we’re very excited about it because that is different from, historically, where we would get a network and to a large extent, it would be kind of good luck, I hope you do well because you have great value. In this case, United and certainly we’re talking with other payers about some of the relationships actually is going to be partnering with us, working to drive that, not just sitting on the sidelines and opening we do all of that on our own.
Lisa Gill: Great. That’s very helpful. And then secondly, you did comment on the Walmart relationship but is there any update on or any other retail relationships that you have the market?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, first of all, Safeway continues to go very well. We’ve said that we’re approaching 200 stores. The results in those stores have been great. So we’re very encouraged there. Second is we continue to build out the presence in Walmart. And the number will be a significantly higher than 12 stores, I can assure you of that. And yes, it’s putting a draw stations in, but it’s also providing better healthcare, more healthcare services, with what we call extended healthcare services. The conversation has become very broad and deep. Matter of fact, today, I’m meeting with a very Senior Executive from Walmart about that about that opportunity. Our JV and specifically Walmart is doing in the healthcare. So we continue to build that out. And then third is we are testing. We’re doing some pilots with some other retailers. As we mentioned in the past, we’ve done work with CBS in the Mediclinic’s with their pending potential merger with Aetna. We have great relationship with Aetna, we have a great relationship with CBS. The opportunity that they see also is what we’ve been talking about here. So we’re optimistic of working more productivity potentially with CBS and Aetna as they expand the potential merger with those two companies as well. So a lot in front of us. We have the right strategy, we’re executing it and we’re making a lot of progress.
Lisa Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. You may ask you question.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey Steve, just wanted to follow-up on your consumer comments to Lisa’s question. I guess, as we think about it big picture and holistically, over time, how much do you think all of these consumer initiatives can really add to your growth, whether it’s to volume or revenue?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, we think – if you take a step back and look at where we’re going. Our access with United would be greater than 90%. So we ought to remove the obstacles of not being in network with many of the majority health plans throughout the United States. And in the big states, as we mentioned, when we announced united relationship, the big states of New York, Texas, Florida and California, our access is greater than 95%, so a very strong access. So when we have access, we have an opportunity to compete for laboratory services and accounts. So that’s number one. So great access, it’s improving every day. Second is the consumer is becoming increasingly important, particularly as employers have pushed more of the cost in healthcare to consumers. Consumers, patients are asking questions of what they could do to lower their out-of-pocket cost and also serve themselves in a better way. And so our consumer strategy addresses that, that is making sure that we have a great experience for that patient and the consumer. So many aspects are factored into that. One is what we’ve done with our electronic, our e-tools, we call it MyQuest. We not only have over 5 million registered users, the application continues to get stronger every day. You now can get to lab results, you can schedule an appointment. You could see late times in a Patient Service Center throughout any area you’re in and there will be more to come. So that’s exciting, looking more and more like a contemporary consumer application every day. Second, our access gets better and better. We’re refreshing over Patient Service Centers. You will see that if you go into a number of your Patient Service Center throughout the United States and then we augment that with the access through retailers, so we’ll have more retail-like settings, making it much more physically easy for consumers to go to Quest Diagnostics. Third is we’ll have products. And we have taken our experience in Arizona and also in Colorado, in Missouri with the direct-to-consumer offering. We now believe that’s close to 20 states that we can go direct to consumers. We’re working on driving that solution there’ll be more to come in that regard in the fall. And with all that, when you take a step back and you say when the physician eventually knows that we’re on network and they ask their patient, who would you like to go to, Quest or someone else? They remember that great experience. We have experiences as far as their data. And they also know that it’s not ordered by the physicians, they can order product directly from us like a check up on their cholesterol or their diabetes and hemoglobin A1c. So we think directionally, it’s going to help us gaining share in the marketplace because healthcare is becoming increasingly more of a consumer marketplace.
Kevin Ellich: Got you. That’s super helpful, Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Kevin Ellich: And then just a quick follow-up on the headwind that you called out earlier on the call, hep C, drug testing, vitamin D. What – did that have any impact on your – or what impact did it have on your revenue per requisition, if any?
Mark Guinan: Yes, really not anything substantive. I mean, those businesses are within the same that cover the overall revenue per req.
Kevin Ellich: Sounds good. Thanks, Mark.
Mark Guinan: Yeah, the one difference is obviously, when you get denials that’s going to have a negative impact. So when you don’t and the tests aren’t ordered like in a hep C case, then it kind of has a neutral impact. But certainly, when we do work and then get denied, obviously, that’s a headwind to revenue per req.
Kevin Ellich: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. You next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Dan.
Dan Leonard: Hello. Just one question on the pacing of M&A. So how much of a catalyst you think UnitedHealthcare contract is going to be by itself with its value-based components? And how quickly do you think that could accelerate some of the discussions you’re having with healthcare system CEOs?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, the first catalyst is PAMA, okay? So PAMA is a substantial change for hospitals renting outreach businesses. So in many hospital system outreach businesses, their Medicare mix is 25%, 30%, so not insignificant. And when they’re looking at essentially a 30% cut over three years, it’s a notable difference. That’s number one. Second is they are seeing what’s happening with United and also with Aetna. And they there are hearing that what those two large nationals have done will carry over to the rest of the health insurance market place. So they’re realizing there will be pressure on their commercial race going forward for ancillary services and in this case, laboratory services. So with all that, so long as – we’ve already – we’ve always had great access around this – talking to them around their last strategy, but it is accelerating the pace of them considering their options going forward.
Dan Leonard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may ask you question.
Mark Massaro: Hey thanks guys. So your large lab competitor will be coming in that network lab provider to Aetna beginning in 2018. Is there anything your team can or need to do to defend your share of that business? And then secondly, do you expect a resolution from the PAMA lawsuit perhaps in Q3?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So first of all, we’re actively detailing out account by account what we need to do. The way we broadly think about is in three categories. One, we have great accounts. And account – a client might be using an old laboratory that they have to, because we work with the United, and we’re going directly for those accounts and we’ll try to flip those as quickly as possible. So as I said earlier, we’ve left the blocks and we’re running. And we’re detailing our thousands of accounts throughout United States with our sales force and with our regional teams. Number two, there is accounts kind of a mixed model where they’re using multiple labs. And now where we have much more of significant share of their laboratory volume because we’re back in network, it’s an opportunity where they potentially get to a tipping point, and we potentially could become the majority of their lab service providers. So we have a number of accounts that the categories that way. And the third category as we’ve outlined is, in some cases, we are not the majority in our another national competitor has more share. And we’re also detailing out those to make sure we defend what we deliver, our value that we deliver everyday is quite good, our quality gets better, our service performance is outstanding, our consumer strategy is resonating. And so we think we have a very, very strong requisition – value proposition to defend that piece of our marketplace as well.
Operator: Are you ready for the next question?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. That comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. You may ask the question.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Ann Hynes: Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, your DSOs are up year-over-year four or five days and then up sequentially, is that due to acquisitions? Or is that a lot to do with increased denials for the vitamin D in the drug monitoring testing?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Ann, the denials are not increasing our DSOs. The denials we don’t recognize revenue. So what’s really driving it is handful of things, one of them is we’re doing a significant laboratory conversion in one of our major labs and billing just ends up being a little more delayed. It’s a rhythm of things that we’ve done over time. It’s nothing to be concerned about. In fact, if you look at the aging of the DSOs, the profile has not really changed. So if you look at the key metric and what proportion of our DSOs are over 90 days, it hasn’t changed even though the DSOs have gone up. So this is just a temporary spike and something that we’re not concerned at all about and very confident that we’re going to hit our $1.3 billion operating cash flow guidance that we provided.
Ann Hynes: Okay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about you think the growth will accelerate in the second half and you’re confident, you’ll make your guidance. So is that driven by acquisitions? Or do you think that organic growth will improve from the 0.5% that you reported this quarter?
Mark Guinan: So our organic growth will markedly improve. We walked through the drivers. Obviously, it’s an easier compare so that’s part of it. We just to remind everybody about that, the majority of that compares in Q3, but we had a little bit of impact in Q4. So each of the quarters are going to get some lift from that. We mentioned, both Steve and I, that we have some professional laboratory services deals that we feel are very close. That’s organic. And we’re expecting to get some volume for that in the back of the year, with that accelerating sequentially. And then the actions that we talked about that we’ve taken around prescription drug monitoring and vitamin D denials, where we’ve gotten some of those addressed, and we’re optimistic that a couple others are in the cusp that they will help as well. And then of course, as we near the entry to the United contract, we would expect that some of that volume will flip over a little bit early. So when you put all of those pieces together, that’s why we’re highly confident. So we’re not depending on executed M&A but obviously, to the extent that we do some deals between now and the end of the year that would just be additional upside.
Ann Hynes: Okay, great. And just one last test. With the hepatitis C testing, I think you highlighted that the drug monitoring testing and the vitamin D should come back once you work with the payers, but the hep C won’t. Is that a huge percentage of volume as a percentage hep C testing?
Mark Guinan: No. It’s not a huge percent. It’s a small percentage. But every several million dollars makes a difference in quarterly performance. I think a lot of that is behind us, because we’re not experts, but we believe that AbbVie has more than half the market already. And therefore, a lot of that is already behind us.
Steve Rusckowski: And the other part is – there’s two parts to what we call a hep C care, which is the testing we do if you’ve been prescribed the drug that is going to decline. Second part is the screening piece of this. So we did see a small decline in the growth rate, and we’re hopeful there’s still a tremendous opportunity in front of us that we’re going to work with the pharmaceutical companies to continue to build on the awareness necessary in the marketplace. Because as I said in my prepared remarks, there’s still a majority of baby boomers, 70 million of us, that still need to be screened. So that’s slow as well in Q2. And we’re hopeful in the back half with some of the work we’re doing to build awareness with pharma, that should pick up as well.
Mark Guinan: But just to be clear, it’ still growing, it just didn’t grow as fast.
Steve Rusckowski: Grow fast. Yes.
Ann Hynes: Okay. Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Hopped on a little bit late, so I’m not sure if you gave this, but do you have a baseline of how much drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D all in makeup of total requisitions? Just a rough ballpark?
Mark Guinan: Ralph, we haven’t provided that. We have other franchises, other testing segments that are obviously a lot larger. Certainly, our chemistry panels and our lipid panels and so on. I think these are already – obviously areas, not Vitamin D as much, but the Hep C and prescription monitoring are major growth drivers for us. And prescription drug monitoring, as Steve mentioned and I did as well, continues to be a growth driver. It’s just slowed somewhat because of these policy changes that we, again, feel are inappropriate. It really has to do everything with – around covering definitive testing after screening. The traditional practice has been, if you do a screen and it’s positive, you move automatically or revert to the definitive on the same day with the same sample. And some of the payers for reasons that we are pushing back on deciding they would change that and make the patient come back in for a second trial. We don’t think that’s medically appropriate. So that was a big headwind in PDM why we slowed our growth. And then on hep C, certainly, we expect that to continue to grow. It’s a nice business, but certainly, it’s nowhere near some of the routine testing or other requisition volume that we see within our business.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So what we did is we outlined three areas that caused us to have less than what we had expected in Q2. We started working already on Q2 on some of the remedies for that slow down. And so the ones that we outlined particularly around prescription drug monitoring, the growth rate was strong but not nearly as strong in the past, and again, what we talked about with Vitamin D. So we’ve already started to work on these in Q2 that will carry over and will have some rebound in the portion of this. But what we want to do is provide visibility where we thought we were going to do – have a stronger performance in Q2, we did not. And we outlined those in the three that we provided to you.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. And is there anything separately – is there anything with the timing of the UNH contract we need to be aware of? In other words, I know the contract starts Jan 1, 2019. So you remain out-of-network for this year with UNH and sort of still charge the out-of-network rate or have you agreed to sort of annual network rate sooner even without the open network?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So I’m not going to comment on any specifics around rates, but we remain out-of-network, we’ve been adjudicated out-of-network for the balance of the year. And then as we said, starting January 1, we’ll be in for majority of their plans, there’s still some HMO plans that we are working for the details. But for the vast majority of United, we’re going to be in network as of January 1.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. Last one if I could squeeze it in. Just – and I know you’re going to guide for 2019 at this point, but can you give us a directional sense of margin as we think about next year? There’s a lot of moving parts, obviously, with PAMA headwinds, UNH coming on, Aetna opening up, the investments you’re making. In your mind, does that mean that make there’s sort of a revenue boost and we should think about margins as generally flat? Or do you think you can get margin expansion or vice versa? Do you think there could be some margin contraction as we think just directionally of the margin trend for 2019?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So Ralph, as I am sure you would expect, I can’t comment on 2019 in any way specifically. But what I did talk about was on a multi-year basis that we would grow earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than the top line over multi-year. So certainly, from a given year-to-year, that formula might be a little bit different. So we – that obviously implies continued margin expansion. Now margin – net margin, so obviously with tax reform, we took advantage of that and made some investments, which actually reduced our – before tax margin slightly this year, had some impact on that. But we would expect to continue that over multi-year look, and we’ll give an update on that in November on our Investor Day.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. All right, thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter 2018 conference call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.  Also, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that were effective January 1, 2018 and were adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient possibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. 
Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on fourth quarter performance. We delivered strong revenue growth despite the negative impact of severe weather and lower Medicare reimbursement under PAMA. Earnings growth was driven by continued strong execution as well as the benefits of tax reform. We also completed our previously announced acquisition of MedXM, which is off to a good start. Now, here are some highlights from the quarter. Revenues were up 3.7%. Reported EPS was up nearly 10% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew 25%. Before I describe the progress we've made, what I'd like to do is to provide an update on PAMA and our investments in the business using a portion of savings from tax reform.  Turning to PAMA, this was our first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, which accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues last year. Since November, we said we expected the impact of the pharma rates under PAMA would be a reduction of approximately 4% in 2018, approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. And our actual Medicare reimbursement in the first quarter reaffirms our projected impact for 2018. We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule. On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS and both sides have submitted their initial briefs to the court and we still believe we could have a decision from the judge by midyear. We want to reiterate that ACLA's complaint is not challenging the new Medicare rates themselves, but rather the process CMS followed to arrive at those rates. As the lawsuit progresses, ACLA has continued to seek a legislative fix to PAMA, coordinating closely with aligned trade associations like NILA, AdvaMedDx and other stakeholders. This issue is about ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to critical laboratory services. While the new rates have impacted us, other laboratory providers, including many serving remote and underserved areas, may be forced to close their doors. So, that's why this is an important issue to us all. Turning to tax reform, last quarter, we shared with you that we will realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis in 2018. We are reinvesting roughly $75 million before tax into the business and our people and much of this is underway. Turning to the first quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate our growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, which were achieved for the fifth consecutive year in 2017. We had a productive quarter for M&A. We completed our acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services. More on this acquisition in a few minutes. We're integrating the acquisitions announced in the latter half of 2017 and we are pleased by the results. We guided earlier this year we expect to deliver about 250 basis points of growth from M&A in 2018, which is above the top end of our 1% to 2% objective. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and our strategy is delivering growth. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. In March, we entered into a professional lab services relationship with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England. We acknowledged earlier that PAMA is a headwind for us. However, reimbursement cuts are bigger headwinds for hospital systems operating outreach laboratories.  Hospital executives are starting to become more aware of the impact of PAMA and we're having more frequent conversations with them about their lab strategy and how we can help. Many of you have asked about the possibility of expanding your access with major health plans. We continue to have productive conversations and make progress with a number of payers. Quest offers health plans and their members' unmatched convenience, access, quality and value. And based upon our recent conversations, it's clear that many health plan leaders agree. We're delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Key growth drivers in the quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening.  In advanced diagnostics, we're making strong progress with our new center of excellence in precision medicine oncology in Texas. The center is helping community oncologists determine the most appropriate treatment of patients with cancer. Since we acquired Med Fusion, we've seen an acceleration of growth of their tumor panels. 70% of patients with cancer are treated by community cancer centers and we're excited about the opportunities that Med Fusion is creating with networks of community cancer practices like The US Oncology Network and Texas Oncology, as well as Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest health system in Texas. We continue to make strong progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice of consumers. Our Walmart locations continue to perform well with an increase in patient traffic across the board and outstanding feedback on the customer experience. We're expanding into different markets and we expect to open many more locations throughout this year. We're pleased with the progress and excited about the future of this important partnership with Walmart. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. The integration of MedXM is going well. Customers are excited that we can help them close their gaps in care using mobile healthcare professionals to reach patients when and where it's convenient for them. So, let me give you one example on this capability, is closing gaps of care. Diabetic eye screening is a key part of diabetes care. MedXM's National Health Plan customers identify at-risk Medicare Advantage or managed Medicaid members.  MedXM call centers then reach out to those patients to schedule health risk assessment to visit the patient and perform a series of tests, which include capturing a retinal image. This program helps identify people at risk of diabetes. It enables health plans to improve their quality scores. The second element of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Earlier this month, we launched the pilot program with Humana MultiPlan, Optum, UnitedHealthcare to use Blockchain technology to improve the quality of healthcare providers data and reduce administrative costs. We look forward to continuing to use our data and expertise for this project, which we believe can lower cost and improve efficiency within the healthcare system. We are continuing to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. So, let me give you a few updates. Our collaboration with Optum 360 continues to perform well. As consumers there, in a pre-share share of cost of their healthcare, more of our revenues come from patients, which poses collection challenges. And despite the pressure from increased patient responsibility, we're succeeding in keeping our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility in line with last year. We're collaborating with payers to bring price transparency to healthcare through our real-time estimation tool. This tool enables a health plan member at a patient service center to know before a specimen is drawn if the test is covered and what out-of-pocket cost the health plan member will pay for that test. We're continuing to enable our business to improve the customer experience. Our e-check-in process has been used in more than 27 million patient encounters. Our patients like the convenience and this information helps us place providers where they are needed most based on the patient flow. We have 1,500 sites with e-check-in and expect to deploy in all of our patient service centers by the end of 2018. Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance. 
Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion were up 3.7% versus the prior year.  Please note that due to a change in revenue recognition accounting, we now report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, improved 4.1% compared to the prior year, with approximately 340 basis points attributed to acquisitions.  Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.2% versus the prior year driven by acquisitions, with organic growth essentially flat. Volume was negatively impacted by weather and the timing of major holidays during the quarter.  The impact of weather presented a volume headwind of 60 basis points. The timing of the Easter and Passover holidays this year versus last year weighed on first quarter requisition volumes and created a tougher year-over-year comparison. Revenue per requisition in the first quarter grew by 1.6% versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds during the quarter were approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in February and is in line with the trends we've observed for several quarters. After many changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019 as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds. Reporter operating income for the quarter was $272 million or 14.5% of revenues compared to $279 million or 15.4% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $303 million or 16.1% of revenues compared to $297 million or 16.3% of revenues last year. Operating income decreased by $8 million compared to the prior-year as a result of weather. The decline in operating margin was caused by a mix of PAMA, weather and acquisitions, which are in the early stages of integration and, therefore, not yet delivering full-margin contribution. Almost, as Steve mentioned, we're using a portion of our savings from tax reform to reinvest into the business and our people. We expect these investments to help us continue to accelerate growth, which also impacted operating margin in this quarter. Reporter EPS was $1.27 in the quarter compared to $1.16 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.52, up roughly 25% from $1.22 last year.  Note that our adjusted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based comp to provide greater clarity into the underlying operational performance of our business. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 23% compared to 32% last year. As I mentioned earlier, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are no longer reported in selling, general and administrative expense. That said, we intend to provide periodic updates on the progress we continue to make with our revenue cycle management partner, Optum 360. In the first quarter, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are flat year-over-year.  Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $180 million versus $196 million last year. The year-over-year difference was largely due to movements in our working capital accounts. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $73 million compared to $42 million a year ago, which is in line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2018 remains unchanged and as follows. Revenues to be between $7.7 billion and $7.77 billion, an increase of 4% to 5% versus the prior year.  Reported diluted EPS to be between $5.42 and $5.62 and adjusted EPS to be between $6.50 and $6.70. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to be between $350 million and $400 million. Recall that our guidance includes only the acquisitions that we've closed to date and that we closed several acquisitions in the back half of 2017. We expect the earnings accretion from these deals to continue to ramp up throughout 2018 and into 2019. I'll now turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. To summarize, we delivered a strong first quarter. We made solid progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. And with that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. Good morning. So, just a quick clarification on the EBIT margins, it sounds like there's a number moving parts between PAMA, weather, acquisitions, and some investment in your people. Can you comment on how EBIT margins arrived in the quarter compared to your internal plan?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. Sure, Dan. I'll handle that. Certainly, PAMA was in our plan. The reinvestment to some of tax reform – again, this is self-evident, but when you reinvest tax, you're going to see a negative impact to the EBIT margins, obviously, offset by tax with the net results, though, obviously, being an increase in net income as a percent revenue. The one thing that, obviously, we hadn't planned on was the weather. And as I mentioned, there was about $8 million impact of operating margin, which, certainly, you can see, that if that had not happened, we actually still would have grown EBIT margins despite PAMA, despite the reinvestment. Kind of worst part of the holidays. We know that the way the calendar falls has impact. We never quite know exactly how to predict, what that impact might be. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, that's probably what I would say. And then, the last piece is acquisitions. That was certainly a part of our plan when we put together a business case and we planned those synergies. We know, as we've shared in the past, that it can take up to 12 to 18 months to get them to be kind of at their going rate of profitability. So, that was certainly in our plans as well.
Dan Leonard: Okay. Helpful color. And then, just a follow-up, you commented on tumor profiling in the prepared remarks. Can you comment on how your tumor profiling strategy might evolve, now that there is an NCD from Medicare for FDA-approved tumor profiling tests?
Stephen Rusckowski: So, Steve here. This is evolving. It has evolved and, I would say, it will continue to evolve. I think there's more and more interest by the FDA on how they will continue to think about oversight and regulatory controls around laboratory developed tests. And this, I would describe, as one of the areas that they're looking at. So, with the new guidance that's out that did tick a forum that we're actually pleased about because we believe that we do have the process capabilities and the control capabilities to be able to support that. And then second is, with that, it legitimizes through CMS the value that the tumor panels add to the diagnostic workup of a cancer patient. So, it just brings front and center the importance of getting a full workup when you make that expensive next choice in cancer care. I think given my earlier comments with our acquisition of Med Fusion, about our strong work relationship with US Oncology, our working relationship with Memorial Sloan and IBM Watson, we have a strong and growing presence in the whole space. So, we're very well positioned and actually pleased that there is some certain energy around it and some guidance about the controls in general because, I think, it's very important as we go forward that legitimate operating companies like ourselves that bring a lot of value to the marketplace have tight controls around the value of that, the verification of value of that and then the delivery of that. And we do that quite well. And so, therefore, approval for that and some kind of controls around that, we think, is a good thing.
Dan Leonard: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a good performance in the quarter. So, I have one question and then a quick follow-up. Just if you can give us an update on the United Lab contract and the timing for an Aetna RFP. 
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah, sure. So, as the industry knows, our nearest competitor's contract expires in 2018, number one. Number two is we've said that, obviously, we would like, under the right terms, to be on contract with United. We have also shared that we are in dialogue and we have nothing to share about that dialogue. And at the right time when we hopefully will have something, we'll share that. So, we're making progress there. We also make progress with hundreds of others of health plans. Some big and some small. And we feel, as we enter 2019, we'll be in a really nice shape in terms of our portfolio relationships. And these relationships, yes, they're contractual related to being in network, but they're becoming more and more strategic. I mentioned the work we're doing with our Extended Care Services and Population Health, the work we're doing around price transparency and our estimation tool. So, what we're doing is we definitely are showing ourselves as a laboratory. But as we said, we're in the diagnostic information services business. And the last part of this is our consumer strategy is really resonating. That whole consumer experience, we're upgrading our patient service centers. We're e-enabling it with our e-checking capabilities. We're bringing nice information capabilities with our MyQuest application and this resonates extremely well with the health plans big and small. So, making good progress. And when we have something, we'll make sure that you all hear it quickly.
Ricky Goldwasser: Great, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the M&A. Obviously, you're looking for 2.5% growth for 2018. So, in case I missed it, what the contribution of M&A in the quarter? And you said that new M&A is not included in guidance. So, now that PAMA is in place, I mean, have you seen any impact on valuation.
Stephen Rusckowski: I'll turn it to Mr. Mark. The question is how much M&A is in the quarter in Q1. And then, let's make more clarity around what we said around what was in the guidance for the 4% to 5% for M&A and what was excluded. So, Mark, you want to take that about Q1 and then the guidance? 
Mark Guinan: So, in the first quarter, M&A contributed 3.5% of the 3.7% total or the 4.1% of our core business. And we had included 250 basis points or 2.5% in our 4% to 5% guidance for the year. And that, obviously, will be stronger in the first half because we annualized some deals that you work through the year, but there's also potential upside without committing anything for new deals because we do not contemplate that in our guidance.  Now, MedXM, which we had closed early in the year, was contemplated because it was completed by the time we shared our guidance in late January.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You may go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: You bet. Thanks for hearing the question. Good morning, Steve. I guess, first off, can you talk a little bit more about the investments that you're actually making from the tax savings, what impact you expect it to have on the business? And then, just a real quick update on the retail growth strategy. How much contribution is that to your growth and how many more locations you're planning to open up this year?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. Okay. So, first of all, on tax reform, what we shared with our fourth quarter results is we're going to take about $75 million in investment in the business and I would say the majority of this is around accelerating growth. What we've said around up and the kind of the outlines of broad categories, and those broad categories, as you would, are some of our growth strategies. So, Quest Diagnostics, the consumer strategy, but also investing in our people. So, we also announced that we're going to provide a bonus for the vast majority of our employees that don't have equity and that will be payable in the fourth quarter. So, all of that has started to feather into what you see starting in Q1 and will continue throughout the year. And with that, we believe this will help us accelerate growth around those five strategies. The second part of your question is around Walmart. We're really pleased with the early returns. We started with the big states – Texas and Florida. They're going well. The customer feedback is really good. And the joint venture continues to look at prospects for other basic health services that we can provide in those stores. And so, we, as you know, formed the JV. This joint venture was about what we do around blood draws and what we do at Quest Diagnostics and our laboratory business. But more importantly, it's all around Extended Care Services and Population Health and providing basic healthcare services to bend the cost curve. And so, we're excited about those prospects as well. We won't give you a number today about how many stores. We're still kind of working out the details with Walmart around that, but there will be more. We have the initial stores and there will be more because the early returns and progress we're making is quite good.
Kevin Ellich: That was good. Thank you. 
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, AJ.
AJ Rice: Hey, how are you guys? Thanks. So, I'll just ask two quick parts here to questions. You referenced the discussions with hospitals in your prior remarks, Steve. I wonder – I know a lot of times – I haven't covered the hospitals for many years – that they don't always see the reimbursement changes coming. And when they come, they tend to then react to them. And I wonder where we're at in that, sort of appreciating what PAMA might mean to their lab business and where you've seen an uptick in discussions because of that? And maybe it will take till next year when there's a further step up. But I just wondered where you think hospitals are in understanding the implications of that and whether that's changing their thinking in any meaningful way about their lab business. And then, just expand on the last question. With all the consolidation activity at CVS, Cigna, Express. Reports about Walmart as well. I wonder, has that changed either urgency of your discussions with some of your retail partners or has it opened up new people coming to you and asking about maybe potential collaboration? Just curious if it's having an impact to your discussion.
Stephen Rusckowski: Okay. So, let me take the first part, which is hospitals. I would say, this is – the pace of awareness is accelerating. What you find is that we have a number of hospital executives that are aware of PAMA. And second is they're greatly aware of all the other pressure that they have in hospitals. So, if you talk to hospital executives today, there's a lot of pressure, and not just with PAMA. And so, many have cost improvement goals. Many are anxious to understand ways they could become more efficient. And so, our hospital strategy plays nicely into being a program that they can launch with us, to put some point through the board, if you will, particularly around in-patient laboratory cost, which is a key part of our value proposition. So, independent of us, it's accelerating. Second is we are accelerating it as well. So, we're knocking on many hospital executives doors to make sure that they are aware, if they're not aware already, and have a conversation around this and specifically around the lab strategy. So, we've engaged with many systems, particularly those that have large outreach businesses to talk about their lab strategy. So, it's a deliberate strategy of our accelerate strategy to make sure that they're well aware and understand what their options could be and think about the possibilities. So, we are helping with the information out there as well. The second part of your question has to do with our retail strategy. Now, we're working on this retail strategy for years. This has happened overnight. As we said, Walmart departed that. We have Safeway who is a part of that. We do active work for CVS in the MinuteClinic. They've evolved their strategy. We have a great working relationship with Aetna. We'll see if that potential merger becomes a reality, but because of the great relationship with CVS and Aetna. We're actually hopeful that this could help accelerate some of the work we could do with them as well. Number one. And number two is the work with Walmart, I said in my earlier comments, is going well. And speculation what they will or will not do on health is for them to communicate about. But just reemphasizes their commitment and energy around this topic. And as far as other retailers, we're working on making sure that we have the right number and also don't leave any geography uncovered. And as you know, some of these partners we have announced so far, like Safeway and Walmart, have a center of mass that doesn't necessarily cover the whole population of the United States. So, as we continue to work through this, we continue to understand how there might be fitting different retail partnerships that could complement what we already have. But, fortunately, we're early to the table around this. We're off and running. You see the reinforcement of this with some of the deals that are out in the marketplace. So, our strategy is the right one. And it's being supported by the marketplace and this consolidation is interesting. But, more importantly, is try to bring their resources together with the capabilities. Our capabilities of data and services are quite essential to what this is all about, which is to bend the cost curve. And that was a portion of my prepared remarks about what we're actually doing with MedXM in the middle overall.
AJ Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you,
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may go ahead.
Jack Meehan: I want to stick with consolidation. How are some of the recent acquisitions you've closed, like Shiel Medical Lab performing? In this conversation with hospitals you're having, how much of an appetite is there for PLS versus sale of lab assets?
Stephen Rusckowski: I'll start and I'll turn it to Mark for some more color. First of all, when we walk in and have a conversation with a C-suite, as a matter of fact, this week we just had a leadership group of our top 40 to 50 executives that we want to make sure are prepared to have a broad conversation about all the capabilities of Quest Diagnostics. Part of that is around what we described as our hospital strategy. And in 2016, in our investor day, we shared this with you. And this, we have three pieces. One is we ask the question, we want to have a conversation around your lab strategy and is that important to you and you have one.  Surprisingly to us, initially, but not anymore, many of the CEOs and the C suites have it on their list. It's one of the strategic question, what they're going to do around lab. And related to that, there's three pieces. One is what they're doing with their hospital inpatient cost and our simple value proposition there is we have now good confidence, a track record of accounts that are all referenceable that we've actually saved them some money because it is a call center and we do that a variety of ways. When we get into that conversation, then we have a conversation around their sophisticated testing or advanced diagnostics that they send to reference laboratories, we're a player there. We're the market leader in that regard and we believe there's more we could do in terms of consolidation and getting smarter about the diagnostics in the inpatient care setting, classing suppliers and making sure you do the right tests for the right patient at the right time.  And the part of this is a conversation, if they're in outreach, if they partner with us with inpatient, if they partner with us around reference testing, what's their strategy around outreach. And this is where we have a conversation around what's happening with PAMA with their Medicare volumes, the pressure that's going to be on commercial rates given the reality of what's happening in this marketplace. And so, we end with a comprehensive strategy. If you see one, you see one. But we've shared last year with PeaceHealth. That was a good example. We bought their outreach. We're helping with their inpatient laboratories and as well we're helping them with their reference testing. So, when that happens, we're their partner for laboratory services in the integrated delivery system. And that's resonating well given all the pressures they have and all the parties that they have in the current dynamic in the marketplace. So, Mark, specific to the opportunities around consolidation, you want to share a little bit about how that's going?
Mark Guinan: Sure, Steve. When you're talking consolidation, you mean within the laboratory industry and specifically us as a consolidator. And, yes, specifically about Shiel, Shiel is early. We're pleased with the initial results. I can share a little bit.  Commercial is fully integrated. From an operational standpoint, largely integrated, including billing, which is critically important. We haven't completely consolidated the entire infrastructure, the draw centers and things like that. That takes a little bit of time. But, certainly, after a few months, we're pleased and on plan. And then, I think, most critically, retention is good. So, if you look at the number of customers that moved over from Shiel to us, relative to expectations and the model, we're doing very well. So, that's what I can share, the point around Shiel. So, feel like it was a very nice deal. And at this point, it's on plan.
Jack Meehan: Great. Mark, I had one follow-up for you, which was on accounts receivable. I know there's some seasonality at the beginning of the year, but it took a bigger step up than we expected, not in the first quarter, maybe just comment on that and bad debt. Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, if you look at the dollars, obviously, we're a larger business, especially with the acquisitions. If you look at the days, 47 and change, that's kind of where we typically are. Last year, we ended at a relatively AR level four a couple of different reasons. I think you may have been asking about year-end Q4 to Q1. And when you think about Q4, that is a ramp down quarter. So, October is much larger than December. And then, if you look at Q1, obviously, it's a ramp up quarter. So, March is much larger than January. So, you're always going to see a dollar dynamic where the end of Q1 in terms of receivables is much larger than Q4.
Shawn Bevec: Jack, I'll also add to that. This is Shawn. With the accounting change around bad debt, that's obviously going to impact all of the historical DSO. So, you'd have to go back and recalculate those after you make the relevant adjustment to get a comparison quarter by quarter.
Jack Meehan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: How are you? One of the more common topics that comes up in our conversations is just the durability of margins once the heavier impacts from PAMA are felt beyond 2018. Can you just talk through any opportunities you see given that you guys have hit your Invigorate targets? And also, how you're think about that in the context of an environment where we're seeing a bit of a tick up in wage growth.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks for the question. What was shared in 2016, and we continuously talk about it, we have our two point strategy. First is all around accelerating growth. We talked at great length of our five strategies around that where we made great progress. The second is operational excellence. And what we shared in the end of 2017 is we achieved our goal of $1.3 billion run rate savings. But what we also shared is we have more opportunities in front of us. This is a large, highly complex business and we still have plenty of opportunities to get better. And what we shared is – one example of that is we're kind of at the final push of harmonizing our processes and standardizing our systems. When we do that, it allows us to streamline our workflow. And then, second is it reduces our IT cost, by way of an example. This will happen in 2018. You'll see that in 2019.  We still have some opportunities around consolidation of our laboratory network. We've shared that we're building a new facility, a new laboratory facility in New Jersey. It's a big project for us. When that is completed, it will allow us to consolidate our physical presence in what we call our east region. So, it will allow us to consolidate some of our regional laboratories into one. We're continuing to see a big opportunity around the e-enablement. When we e-enable the process, we can take cost out. In prior calls, we talked about simple things. For instance, we got a lot of calls that came in to our call centers around results. And so, now what we've done is educated our customers that you can get these results online. And so, what it has done is eliminated a lot of call volume coming into our call centers, allows us to reduce cost. Customers are happy. So, we continuously look at opportunities. And so, we have dialed into our guidance for this year in our outlook. Those opportunities, we haven't given you a specific number. But I'll assure you that it's embedded in those numbers and that allows us to offset the wage inflation and also the reimbursement pressure that we provided you some color around. And that will be clearly in our sights in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and beyond. There's a lot of opportunities. 
Patrick Donnelly: Very helpful. Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may go ahead.
Amanda Murphy: Hi. Good morning. Actually, just had a follow-up to AJ and Jack's questions around your hospital strategy and thank you for all the comments there. When you first outlined the kind of increased focus, you had talked about opportunities to expand relationships over time. For example, getting incremental reference work. I know it's kind of early on some of these deals, but I just was wondering if you could give some comments there in terms of how the conversations are progressing or are there any anecdotal examples of where you've been able to expand relationships over the course of the relationships that you've gotten safe now?
Stephen Rusckowski: So, the one I brought up is PeaceHealth. That's a great example. They looked at their hospital -- excuse me, yeah, looked at their hospital strategy. And that's the three aspects that I talked about, how we can help them help them with their inpatients, laboratory cost. Second is, can we help them become more efficient and effective, rather, reference testing for inpatients, ordering of diagnostics and then, finally, is they had an outreach business. And we now acquired outreach business and integrating it into our west region. A great example.  I would share another example. If you recall back a couple years ago, we bought Hartford Hospitals' outreach business. The way we look at all this, Amanda, is these are beachheads. We start there and then we build. We build credibility. We build existing relationships. We manage the account. And in the case of Hartford, we continue to look at how we can help them, consolidate some of their purchases or reference testing. We had a dialogue around their hospital laboratories and should we help them become more efficient. So, a good example where working relationship, even though it starts in one year, it could build.
Amanda Murphy: Have you seen actual growth then in reference testing if you think back over last year, for example? Is it actually impacting organic volume growth at this point?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. So, interesting enough, what you find is there's two pieces of this. One is, what's happening with our share of the marketplace. And then the second is what's happening in the hospital marketplace. So, actually, what we've seen in Q1 in hospital volumes, given admissions volumes have been relatively flat best – as we talked to hospital executives and this puts a log in our fire to help them become more efficient. There is a lot of pressure on hospitals, both from a volume perspective of patient admissions and second is reimbursement changes. And so, what we see in our reference testing business, even though we might be picking up some more share, volumes are relatively stable. And then, second is, in that portion of our business, we do see some price challenges. There's more competition. And what we have is a deliberate strategy. When we have a market like that, for the leader should get stronger and this plays into our strategy. So, many hospital systems are looking at consolidating suppliers, having a more comprehensive strategy. So, we hope over time to continue to build share, but probably more of a more challenging marketplace than two to three years ago.
Mark Guinan: And just, Amanda, to add, we don't do a POS deal without a reference deal. The only question is how much of the reference business comes. No, we certainly would not just do POS alone. In many of these cases, as we shared, we serve half the hospitals in the country. And so, I'd probably say most of these cases, if not all, we already were doing some reference work. So, there's an opportunity to expand that footprint and do more or, in some cases, all of it. So, that is part and parcel of the relationship. And as we shared, we therefore locked that up in a five to seven-year contract instead of being subject to periodic RFPs and competitive situation. So, it's a nice longer-term relationship between us and the hospital.
Amanda Murphy: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Ross.
Operator: Ross, your line is open. Please check your mute feature.
Ross Muken: Hi. Hopefully, you can hear me. So, I'm just trying to make sense of how you are able to essentially hold margins almost flat – we're down a touch – considering what we saw with PAMA. And the part that I really would like to dig into is on the OpEx line. It looks like on the restated numbers, OpEx was sort of down even a touch year-on-year or flattish, which given the acquisitions implies the core was sort of down. And, obviously, we know you're doing some investments. So, help us understand just kind of sequentially the cadence and then what is implied to the rest of the year because that seems like really good performance considering all of the sort of things you had to deal with in the quarter on the weather and PAMA side.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. So, we'll tag team this. Mark and I again. First of all, as I mentioned in my quote, we did execute well. And I think as we pointed out, there is a lot of moving parts. A lot of moving parts within the quarter. And so, we had to make sure that we managed all those levers. We mentioned, in Mark's comments, we have acquisitions coming in. We have investments for tax reform. And also, there was an earlier comment about what are you doing around our Invigorate program around cost improvements. And so, within Q1, you've got all that going on. Okay? You've that all going on. And so, what we need to – what we do as a management team is we pull together that integrated plan to continue to sell progress. We get to the outlook that we laid out in the marketplace with those moving parts, with the uncertainty sometimes of what's happening in the market. For instance, you cannot predict the severe winter that we saw, but we had to manage our way through that. So, with that as a high level summary, Mark, do you want to give a little more color of the pieces?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, sure. As you know, Ross, price and inflation are headwinds on margin. We talk about our productivity which we've discussed with Invigorate in the past and we said we believe we've got some cost capability. We can drive about 3% a year on a cost base of over $6 billion. So, you can do the math on that. Obviously, we have also shared that we did a substantial amount of M&A. A lot of that was skewed towards the back end. So, we expect margin expansion on that new book of business throughout the year, which will help us. And then, finally, the important piece is organic growth. So, when we grow organically, the way we've been doing, obviously, the drop-through on the incremental revenue is higher than the fully-loaded margin. So, that's another opportunity to offset some of the headwinds in price and inflation. So, when you add all those together, that's where we came out with reaffirming our longer-term outlook despite PAMA being more significant than any of us had anticipated.  We still said we're going be able to do by 2020 what we said in 2016, which is topline of 3 to 5, although I did caution more likely to be in the lower end and the higher end if PAMA stays where it is and then growing our earnings. Not earnings per share, but earnings, mid-to-high single digits. But that, obviously, also directionally has correlation with the topline as well. So, probably more likely to be at the lower end than that. So, in terms of the rest of the year, the investments that Steve referenced, the $75 million, some of those are fairly smooth over the year. Some of them are accounting, like the bonus that Steve mentioned. So, we're clearly that pretty equally. And then, some of them are going to ramp up a little bit as we move throughout the year, but we also have those other factors such as strong organic growth and expansion of our acquired revenue that's been offset, that incremental investment.
Ross Muken: Helpful color. Thank you, guys.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may go ahead.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Mark.
Mark Massaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to touch on organic volumes and revenue in the quarter. Mark, I know you indicated that organic volumes are flattish. You called out 60 basis points from weather. Looking at last year, I think you actually grew organic volumes by 2.6%. And so, I think embedded in your guidance for 2018 is 1.5% to 2.5%. So, can you help us think of some of the key drivers that will get you to your midpoint of 2% organic revenue growth for the year?
Mark Guinan: Yes, sure. So, volume is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. There is a number of factors. When you look at early last year, we had a couple POS deals that were fairly new. And then, those were obviously ramping up. We didn't close a significant amount of POS late in 2017. And, remember, our POS is organic. We're not buying anything. So, that is organic growth. Certainly, as I mentioned, the timing of the holidays – and the floating holidays have significant impact on our – so, if you have – when you look at New Year's, when you look at Fourth of July and when you look at Christmas, if those fall on a weekend versus a Wednesday, there's a dramatic difference in that quarter in terms of the volume. And so, when you look at the way this year started out, the previous year, we had New Year's on a weekend and this year we didn't. So, it's not just that day that you get a little spillover from those holiday right before or right after. Certainly, that had a little impact. So, I wouldn't make too much – read too much into the quarter to quarter slight variation. So, we'll try to share to the best of our abilities what the real drivers are and things that certainly have implications going forward. I'd say, the first quarter, there was a fair amount of noise. And there's significant in terms of utilization or other things that you might be concerned about. And we certainly are very confident of the guidance that we put out and keeping on track with our commitments.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. So, just to add to that, one part of reaffirming the 4% to 5%, if you look at Q1 and we go through some of the pieces, and earlier we got a question on what's happening on the hospital side, hospital admissions are stable. But we were very pleased – we kind of look at all the different pieces of the volumes we see from our physician portion of our business, which is the vast majority of where we get our testing, we are actually, when you think through the different pieces, when you think about what Mark described and some of the headwinds, and you couple with that the offset with PAMA in terms of that price reduction in Q1 and when we look at that physician business, we actually felt okay about our performance in Q1 and we thought it was solid. And therefore, we have confidence in the 4% to 5% for this year, which includes that 250 basis points for acquisition. And as you described it, the rest from organic revenue growth.
Mark Massaro: Thank you, very helpful.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may go ahead.
Bryan Ross: Hi. This is Brian Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I just had a quick one on commercial contract discussions. I know, in the past, you've highlighted the overall value prop that Quest demonstrates during payer conversations, negotiation. I guess, my question is more on how much does the value of Quest lab data play in those conversations? And do you see that becoming a bigger chip in the negotiations as we move forward? And then, secondly, how exactly is Quest currently leveraging and monetizing that data and what further opportunities do you see there as we move forward?
Stephen Rusckowski: Brian, it's becoming increasingly more important, particularly as I mentioned in my introductory comments. If you get into Managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, when the payers are, obviously, are taking the risk and they're really trying to understand that 5% of the population represents 50% of the cost. So, what we described with our capabilities in Extended Care Services and specifically called out what we're doing with MedXM. The ability for us to have specific programs where we used the data we have to pinpoint and to identify the patient and then they use our call centers and then our onsite services, which could be in a convenient location like a Walmart, but also it could include one of our care professionals going into someone's home. So, a lot of interest around, yes, we are the world's largest lab, but what we are is the world's largest diagnostic information services company, which includes using the data to identify the opportunities and then manage the care in a more active way and bend the cost curve.
Bryan Ross: Got it, thanks.
Mark Guinan: And I would also add that some of the things Steve referenced, like our real-time estimation, they see the value of that because one of the difficulties that they deal with is patients being surprised about coverage, patient being surprised about cost. And so, this is, as we shared in the past, one of the win-win-win all around. The patient is happier. We're happier. The payers are happier. So, they actually appreciate us rolling out that tool. It's not just for us. It helps them quite a bit as well. So, patients can make decisions ahead instead of finding out after around coverage and cost and so on. So, really, the value that we bring goes well beyond just the data. The other one is our sales force. So, when you look at how they are struggling to control costs, we are part of the solution. The national labs are great value. And the fact that we can deploy our sales force to help them with physicians, we call it leakage or steerage, we are setting work to high cost providers. And with data from the payer, walk in and say, hey, doc, you've got some patients on high deductible plan. You're costing them money when you send them to this laboratory. Let me show you from their insurance company the difference between setting it up and sending it to this – who you're currently utilizing. That's powerful for the payers. They know that, actually, in that case, we are fully aligned. And then, finally, the retail strategy. They really like that. Yes, they want to control costs, but they want their patients to get their diagnostic work done, especially if you're monitoring a condition, if they're a risk-bearing entity. They've got Managed Medicare, Medicaid. They want those patients to get these things done. And, obviously, if we're putting in more convenient sites, it's more likely the patients will get that critical testing.
Mark Guinan: A secondary value we bring to the table, I mentioned in my remarks, is around quality scores. So, if the quality scores are right, they are driving the right care process and to close those gaps in care, we help identify those patients which allows them to score better and get higher reimbursement from payers. So, it all fits together. The value is well beyond our diagnostic testing.
Bryan Ross: Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
Stephen Rusckowski: Okay. Well, we appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support. And you have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I'd now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. This quarter we have included a 2018 adjusted EPS bridge on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. The text of our prepared remarks will be available on the site later today. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, and review progress on our strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2018 guidance. Well, we finished the year on a high note by delivering a strong fourth quarter. Revenues grew 4%. Reported EPS grew 67%, and adjusted EPS grew nearly 7%. For the full-year 2017, revenues were up 2.6% on a reported basis, and up 2.9% on an equivalent basis versus 2016. EPS was up 22% on a reported basis, and more than 10% on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was up by nearly 10% from 2016. 2017 was a good year. I'm pleased to announce we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 11%. This is the seventh increase since 2011. Before I describe the progress we have made, what I would like to do is to talk about two dynamics impacting our industry, PAMA and Tax Reform. PAMA represents a significant headwind. In November, we said that we expect the impact of the final rates on the PAMA to be approximately 4% of our revenues from the clinical IP schedule in 2018, and approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. As you know, in December, we fully supported ACLA's lawsuits charging that incentives from Medicare and Medicaid services, failed to follow our congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system, and we believe we could have a decision from the judge by midyear. In the meantime, our trade association will continue to work with Congress to secure a legislative solution. Now turning to tax reform, Quest is a significant beneficiary of lower corporate tax rates, which will enable us to grow earnings per share invested in our business and our people. We will realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis in 2018. With those tax savings, we are reinvesting roughly $75 million before tax into the business and our people. Some of these initiatives include advanced diagnostic innovations through new test, and the high touch configured services. Investments to deliver consistently excellent consumer experience both online through our MyQuest patient app, and all of our patient service centers. And then, finally we will pay a bonus of up to $500 to about 40,000 employees as the way of saying things. We're playing a vital role in our success. This bonus will be based on the company's performance and accelerating growth in 2018. Now turning to the progress we made in the fourth quarter. We delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first outlet of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% per year through strategic aligned accretive acquisitions, which we achieved for the fifth consecutive year. We had another very productive quarter for M&A. We completed our previously announced acquisitions of Cleveland HeartLab, which builds on our position and advanced diagnostics and shield medical laboratory, which will further strengthen our position in the New York metropolitan marketplace. Our M&A pipeline remains very strong, and our strategy is delivering growth. And this is evidenced by originally announced acquisition of Mobile Medical Examination Service or MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessment and related services. Our seven announced acquisitions in 2017 will enable us to exceed our long-term M&A objective of 1% to 2% top line growth for 2018. And of course any earnings accretion realized from these acquisitions in 2018 will help offset the impact of new Medicare rates. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospitals and health systems. Our professional life services revenues grew by double-digits in 2017, and delivered healthy operating margin as more hospitals benefited from the standardization, scale, and innovation that we bring to these relationships. While the new Medicare rates are headwinds for us, we also believe that rates will be a catalyst for consolidation later in 2018 and beyond as hospital systems face increasing pressure from lower Medicare rates. We've had a number of conversations with hospital C suits that indicate their increased sense of urgency about rethinking their lab strategy. We took a number of actions to deliver on the third element of our gross strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. In women's health, we continue to be excited about the progress we are making in noninvasive prenatal screening. Our Q-Natal test enjoyed strong double-digit growth in 2017. Our contributors to growth in 2017 were prescription drug monitoring with growth in excess of 20%, QuantiFERON tuberculosis testing, Hepatitis C screening which posted double-digit growth of 2017. We also established new advanced diagnostic centers for excellence for cardiovascular testing and precision oncology in conjunction with our acquisitions of the Cleveland HeartLab and Med Fusion. We continue to make strong progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. We opened six locations in Wal-Mart stores in 2017; five in Florida, and one in Texas. The early feedback from our patient satisfaction surveys is extremely positive. Our customers appreciate the convenience of being able to get their testing done where they shop. The ease of the check-in provided this easy enablement and the professionalism of our phlebotomists are noted in all the surveys. There is more to come in 2018 as our collaboration with Wal-Mart expands to include basic healthcare services. So we'll keep you posted on our progress. Our relationship with Safeway, which is down in second year continues to expand. We're now operating in 184 stores in 12 states. We have similar positive feedback from both our employees and our customers on their experience in these locations. We are also powering the healthcare consumer with our MyQuest mobile application, which is now delivering rapid results into the hands of nearly 5 million users. This is an increase of more than 1.3 million users in 2017. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. We are building a solid data analytics pipeline with a strong number of partner's interest in leveraging our data, including pharma, CRO, and health plan customers. We are very excited about our acquisition of MedXM. This will give us access to more mobile healthcare professionals, which expands our scale and reach into the mobile and home segments, as well as bolstering our overall capabilities in extended care. The second element of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. I'm very pleased to that we have exceeded our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate invigorate savings as we exited 2017. We will maintain our discipline in this area; continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness. Every year, we need to cover the cost of wage inflation and price compression. Given our track record of delivering in this area over many years, going forward we will provide periodic updates on our progress in lieu of a specific run rate savings growth. Quality and efficiency go hand-in-hand. And as we drive operational efficiency, we continue to prove the customer experience. More than half of our 2,200 patient service centers are live with the check-in kiosk, which improved the patient experience. By the end of the year, we expect to have that capability in all of our locations. E-check-in enables phlebotomists to spend less time on clinical tests and more time to deliver the better patient experience. Turning to our outlook, our guidance for the full-year 2018 reflects expectations for continue acceleration of top line growth of 4% to 5%, and more than 20% adjusted earnings growth, driven in part by solid mid-to-high single-digit adjusted earnings growth from operations. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through our financial performance and our 2018 guidance in more detail. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.94 billion were up 4.1% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew 4.5% compared to the prior year, with approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.4% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. The impact of hurricane Maria on our operations in Puerto Rico presented a headwind of approximately 20 basis points to volume in the fourth quarter. Revenue per acquisition in the fourth quarter grew by 2.1% versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per acq is not a proxy for price; it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix, and test per acq. Unit price headwinds remained less than 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, consistent with the trends we observed throughout 2017. Excluding the impact of PAMA, we would expect unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain less than 100 basis points, with PAMA adding an additional headwind of approximately 50 basis points on our DIS segment. After many changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will step-up in 2019 as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price that we impacted growth in our POS partnerships other mix settlements including test mix was strong contributing more than 200 basis points in the quarter. This trend has remained consistent over the last couple of year. Reported operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 13.9% of revenues, compared to $276 million or 14.8% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $317 million or 16.4% of revenues compared to 305 million or 16.4% of revenues last year. Reported EPS was a $1.82 in the quarter compared to a $1.9 a year ago. The increase is related to a net tax benefit recorded as a result of the recent tax legislation. Adjusted EPS was a $1.40 up nearly 7% from a $1.31 last year. The company recognized in ample tax net benefit totaling $74 million within the quarter. This primarily reflects the tax benefit mentioned previously, partially offset by system conversion, restructuring, integration and other charges. The net impact for these items increased our reported EPS by $0.53. Our reported fourth quarter tax rate is significantly lower than the prior year as a result of tax reform. In the quarter, we recorded approximately $0.02 per diluted share of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation or ETB compared to approximately $0.01 per share benefit last year. In the full year 2017, we recorded $0.27 per share of ETB, which is an increase of $0.21 year-over-year. At this point, I would like to highlight that January 2018; we will exclude ETB from our adjusted EPS calculation. We believe we have changed for providing with better insights into the operational performance of our business. Bad debt expense for the fourth quarter as a percentage of revenues was 3.8% 20 basis points higher than last year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. For the full year 2017 bad debt was 4.1% flat year-over-year. As a reminder beginning in 2018, new revenue recognition rules will require us to classify un-collectable balances associated with pace of responsibility as a reduction in net revenue as oppose to bad debt expense. As you think about 2018, considering the impact of this change on our revenue for each quarter of 2017 which is shown in no aid at the end of this morning's earnings press release. You should use this adjustment as the basis for comparability in 2018. The reduction in revenue for each quarter in 2017 is accompanied by an equal reduction in SG&A expense with no impact operating or net income. Turning to cash provided by operations, we generated $1.2 billion in 2017 versus $1.1 billion last year. Capital expenditures during the year were $252 million compared to $293 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing with following outlook for 2018, revenues to be between $7.7 billion and $7.77 billion an increase of 4% to 5% versus the prior year. Reported diluted EPS to be between $5.42 and $5.62 and adjusted EPS excluding both amortization and ETB to be between $6.50 and $6.70. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to be between $350 million and $400 million. Here are some items for you to consider, given all the moving piece as in 2018. First, as a result of tax reform, we expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 24%. We expect to realize approximately $180 million in adjusted tax ratings. Of this amount, we expect to deliver roughly $120 million after-tax or approximately $0.85 to our adjusted EPS in 2018. Additionally, we intend to reinvest approximately $75 million before tax as the benefit to support our two-point strategy. From a cash perspective, we expect our lower tax rate to increase cash from operations by approximately $160 million in 2018. Second, we expect unit price reimbursement price shown on our DIS segment to remain less than 100 basis points excluding PAMA, with an additional headwind of approximately 50 basis points including PAMA. In the gone November, we sized the impact of PAMA as approximately 4% of 2018 Medicare revenue from the clinical lab fee schedule and approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. Our forecasted impact on the business over the next three years from the fee schedule reduction remains unchanged. Third, our revenue guidance for 4% to 5% growth includes all the M&A that we have closed to date including MedXM. We estimate the revenue impact of recently closed acquisitions as well as carry over from acquisitions that closed earlier in 2017 to be roughly 2.5% in 2018. The earnings accretion from these deals will ramp throughout 2018 and into 2019. Fourth, our 2018 revenue guidance reflects the classification of patient related bad debt against revenue in accordance with the new revenue recognition standard. Fifth, as Steve noted earlier, we exceeded our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate Invigorate savings to the end of 2017. Our efforts around Invigorate will continue indefinitely as we should. Best-in-class organizations take out at least 3% of cost per year. We believe Quest is a best-in-class organization and will continue to drive operational excellence to drive annual efficiencies of this magnitude. As Steve mentioned, given our track record of delivering in this area, going forward we will provide periodic updates in lieu of the specific run rate savings goal. Sixth, as I highlighted earlier and as noted in our earnings release, beginning in 2018, we will exclude ETB from our adjusted EPS calculation. For historical comparisons, our adjusted EPS results for 2016 and 2017 included $0.06 and $0.27 of ETB respectively. Seventh, the increase in our CapEx guidance reflects in large part, the planned start of our multi-year new lab construction in New Jersey. Additional investments in our advance and consumer growth strategies as well as final build out cost associated with headquarters moving to Secaucus. And finally, as you think through your models for the first quarter of 2018, please note that to date we have already experienced nearly as much weather impact as we did in the entire first quarter of 2017. Before I turn it back to Steve, I would like to provide some final comments on our capital allocation philosophy and 2020 outlook. Our capital deployment philosophy has served us very well over the last several years and remains unchanged. We expect to continue to return the majority of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. We continue to prefer to use the remainder of free cash to fund M&A activity which we believe will be more robust over the coming quarters in light of PAMA. We regards to our 2020 outlook, we remain confident in targets that we have outlined for 2017 through 2020. These targets include a revenue CAGR of 3% to 5% with 1% to 2% growth expected from acquisitions. And adjusted earnings CAGR faster than revenue in the mid to high single digit range. Last quarter, we shared that this outlook implied adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $7 by 2020. We also shared at that time that we would expect to be towards the lower end of this range given the reimbursement cut associated with PAMA. While the cumulative PAMA headwind to 2020 remains severe, we now believe we will exceed $7 in light of tax reform. I will now turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize, we delivered a strong fourth quarter. In 2017, we made great progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. Our guidance for the full-year 2018 reflects expectations with this continuation of acceleration of the top line and bottom line growth. Quest benefits from tax reform. And we are investing in our business and our people. Now we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.
Amanda Murphy: Hi, thanks. Good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Amanda.
Amanda Murphy: Just a question on guidance, so from a top line perspective, it's little difficult obviously given all the moving parts sort of compared to consensus, but it feels like the numbers or the top line growth rates are sort of pretty strong relative to expectations. And I was just curious so you have obviously given a lot of information around M&A and the unit pricing dynamics, but what are you thinking in terms of at least maybe qualitatively how to think about the various dynamics around organic growth? They are just underlying volume growth? The POS contribution that we might expect, is it similar to this year? And then also, I guess, last year technically. And then also how to think about mix particularly given some of the comments you made around investment in new tests et cetera?
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. Amanda, thank you. Well, we are pleased to be able to provide the guidance for 2018 we just did which is 4% to 5% growth. We feel good about that. Our strategy historically remains in 2018 is a balance between acceleration of our organic growth and also to achieve at least 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. And as what I said in my remarks, we have exceeded that high end and that range of 1% to 2% through acquisition, but what I will say in that 4% to 5%, you see both. You see an improvement in organic growth. And you also see an improvement in growth through acquisitions and that's in that 4% to 5%. As far as the growth drivers organically, we continue to see good growth in our professional lab services business. We continue to get good interest. And as we have talked about this - there is a couple of things, one is we have an acceleration in the number of conversations we having with C-suites of integrated delivery system with around their lab strategy. And that hits many aspects of our strategies for growth. First of all, they are quite interested in what we could do with them to make it more efficient and this is our professional lab services business. And so, that has impacted growth in '17 and will continue in '18. Second is we sell them our most sophisticated testing. And so, that acceleration advanced diagnostics will continue as well into '18. And then finally in some cases, like in example of PeaceHealth in 2017, they want us to buy their outreach business. So implied in our guidance is the continuation of that strategy which hits on three aspects of our growth strategy going forward. So, again, a balanced guidance that with both the acceleration of organic growth as well as an acceleration of growth through acquisition. Mark, anything you would like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes, I appreciate the comment Amanda that there is lot of moving parts, but on the top line, the restatement of bad debt really should not change the growth in revenue because bad debt is not going to vary dramatically year-over-year. So, the 4% to 5% is a solid number that it doesn't have a lot of moving parts to it. And then in terms of your questions around the future, we would expect more of the same. Continued friendship towards advanced diagnostics, as Steve, said which should benefit our revenue per acq, but also continued strong growth in POS which will offset that - partially from that. And in price, I covered that pretty thoroughly which is more of the same; some headwinds on the non-government side and then the additional 50 basis points coming from PAMA.
Steve Rusckowski: Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning.
Jack Meehan: Thanks. Good morning. Could you elaborate on the volume dynamic in the fourth quarter? So, you delivered around 1% ex-M&A, but I there is probably some POS in there. So what are you seeing in terms of underlying volume and what's the expectation for 2018 there?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that one?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so we - never volume with requisitions. And what we have also reported is that we continue to see increasingly dense requisitions. So in fact, costs are growing faster than the volume reported. That's really what we do is we do test. So we don't fully understand the trend. We talked a little bit of this, but certainly there is things that are being added. When someone goes in for general healthy checkup whether it's a baby boomer getting the hep C test and that's certainly well back as adding Vitamin B. So, people getting more done when the y go in to get our services in the given encounter. So really we talked about a desire to give you better - inside of the volume was really test, we didn't - found a way to do it yet. So don't read too much into volume as reported by our requisitions. So certainly POS as we mentioned is a double digit grower, but volume trends continue to be solid. We don't see anything that suggests the market shift in utilization. We continue to accelerate our growth and that's what we are expecting during 2018 as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Ellich: Hey, good morning guys. Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Kind of two part here. Mark, you talked about test mix is strong, is there any specific tests that you can call out, or is it really just a function of the more tests per acquisition? And then, you know, manager contracting any updates there on the United and other contracts?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Well, Kevin as I mentioned in the remarks, we continue to make nice growth out of our Q-Natal testing and prenatal testing, number one. Number two is [indiscernible] continues to grow. We have got long ways to go as far as testing the baby-boomers in this country. That continues to grow nicely. Prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big grower for us. We are the market leader in that regard, and that's growing strong double-digits. So you look across the Board and many of our diagnostic testing categories, we're getting some nice growth.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. Just going to take a couple of follow-up questions, so one, just kind of like on the pricing; obviously pricing trends look really, really good in the quarter, you are talking about little bit less than 100 basis points of headwind into next year. Is this odd, because of the mix of the acquisition, or how should we think about kind of affect the pricing environment? And then, on just kind of like [indiscernible] just kind of like more big picture, when we think about [indiscernible] deal and focusing on transforming retail pharmacy and healthcare hubs, how do you think about your role, as part of this overall strategy and any update? Yes.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, the first part, Mark will take around what's in our guidance for price, and the second part I will take on where this is all going with transformation of healthcare. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Yes. And Ricky thanks for the question. So, on the pricing, I think you are referring to revenue per acq and - which includes mix. Pricing itself well is apples and apples, real price, and it will continue to be less than 100 basis points headwind as we mentioned. Obviously when we narrow the mixed elements, including PLS, including tests, payer mix, density of our acquisitions, we have seen an increase in revenue per acq in that space on mix. So we don't expect any change in trends in 2018 relative to what we have seen in the last couple of years in our business. Regarding M&A, there is really not a mixed element of the M&A for the most part, and in certainly the possible acquisition deal that we do, you know, book of business is very similar to our core book of business. Obviously the reimbursement is going to be somewhat different by payer type, but generally the same pricing. So M&A unless it's a very different business like in MedXM or something like along those lines, Med Fusion had a different mix, but generally our M&A will not change revenue direct dramatically. I will turn it back to Steve to answer your further part of your question.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. News now on these consolidations and particular interest around sponsor health plans and what that segment of the population or the industry could do, we think it's very positive for - the strategy that we've been on for number of years now. So as we've talked about, we as one of our strategies want to be the most consumer-oriented laboratory, we talked about that in our prepared remarks, there are multiple aspects, there is an aspect around our experience, there is an aspect around data, around products, and around information. And I mentioned MyQuest app, and this is making a lot of progress, and 2018 will really be a watershed year of really fulfilling lot of our promises in that space. If we go there, then all of it - it is all about serving the consumer and the customer. And number of these mergers and discussions are all about what needs to do - what needs to happen to get better access for consumers or the consumers getting to be more and more involved in healthcare decision-making. And important to address is we partnered with a number of these players already. So we are in the middle of these discussions. So we are all waiting to see about the merger of CVS and Aetna. We have strong relationships with both. We work with both already. Second is relationship with Wal-Mart. We will continue to extend itself. We mentioned our patient service centers opening up in their stores. And also in that regard, we're going to provide health services. And then third is we have the employer business, we sell our [indiscernible] wellness products into large employers. And as we know, 170 million people roughly in this country get their insurance from their employers. And we've been all over this as an opportunity of working with these employers and working with our healthcare insurance partners to do a better job within the cost curve for those corporations, as well as for their employees. And we've actually done this at Quest. We've been working on this for a couple or three years. We've changed the organizational model. We've got more data, and we're working with a number of partners, and actually what we have seen is we have been their cost curves. So we're quite excited about these new developments, and we believe we're really strongly positioned to take advantage of those going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk: Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. Just a couple of quick ones here; first off; Steve; can you just talk a little bit about M&A deal flow and whether or not any valuations have been reset given PAMA or maybe it's just little too early to see those resets at this point? And then secondly, I know that flu doesn't have a big direct impact on the business, but is there any sort of ancillary testing that you tend to pick up just considering that the very severe season that we're going through right now?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So on M&A, we did seven deals. We're now seven deals. That's reflected in our guidance for 2018. That's beyond the 1% to 2% that we've stated as our strategy; we feel good about that. And as we said, the deal flow continues to be strong, and we're optimistic going forward. And there is a lot more interest in what integrated delivery systems will have in their lab strategy going forward, given potential pressure there will be either with PAMA or commercial rates on the ancillary services side. So that continues to be an opportunity for us. As far as resets, we already in our modeling are prudent as far as how we price things and work out our - in terms of what we've guided business and we restated for that business in our hands. We do take into consideration what might happen with Medicare rates. And we feel past deals and forward looking deals we will take that in consideration because that's a real consideration that we do consider in the model to make sure we are back any of us we make an acquisition for our shareholders. So, Mark you want to drill in the second part of the question.
Mark Guinan: Yes. Steve's points recalled that our valuation really is independent of what the business might look like in their hands. When we go back to Investor Day, we went through an example, so the revenue is still adequate because of commercial payers and then the cost, and even more the portion lower given the economies of scale, and that's how we create value. So really our pro forma P&L looks nothing like the P&L that it was in the hands of the seller. So have things changed? Absolutely. Because we're taking into account to change in government reimbursement which impacts both the seller and the buyer, we've been modeling some potential for that for several years now. So it's not lease, and will be taken that into account, but obviously with the new publication of rates, we're building those rates right now as an assumption and to what the future is, ensuring that we pay appropriately for any acquisition. And then on the full piece scale on…
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. We track a number of dynamics in the industry, and we do believe rate is up, that it would impact on - let's just call it activity or utilization into physician's offices. So there's some modest increase from it. But this, as you know, many variables, and as Mark said earlier, when we look at our same-store analysis, we feel that the market is stable. So it's not a big mover, but we did notice the change.
Operator: Our next question is from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Donald Hooker: Great. Good morning. My question was - I'm interested in your comments around consumerism, and you referenced concierge services a few times or that buzzword at least, and then how that might dovetail with that recent acquisition you did have - I guess it's mobile, medical examination, and I know you have a life insurance business where you're going into people's homes as well. Can you maybe tie that together, does that fit into a consumer strategy or what are you thinking there with all those - maybe elaborate on those themes? Thank you
Steve Rusckowski: Absolutely, absolutely. So first of all, when we talked about concierge, we talked about advance diagnostics; there's a lot of science. And it is an innovation business. And we have a new leader that stared about a year ago, [indiscernible], and she's updated our strategy, we're putting more resources in it, and a portion of our incremental investment from tax reform benefit will be invested in our business. And as part of it, yes, there is more science, there is just more capability to do test that will bring to the marketplace but the large part of what you also deliver advanced diagnostics, particularly our genetics. It's that whole experience for the patient and making it seamless and easy for the physician that's ordering that test and so what if it's more resources in that part of it, it's the pre-authorization piece, it's the ordering piece, it's the resulting piece. So my comment in my prepared remarks had to do with that portion of what we describe is concierge services. The second part of your question had to do with a consumer strategy, we've been on this for a multiple years, we made excellent progress in '17 and in '18 I will tell you by the end of '18 we are going to be long ways along with what our vision was. First of all, it's around the whole experience, we are contemporizing bad experience free unit to this new world. So we enabled in a big way, I mentioned the kiosk and now in about half of patient service centers. We are going to that experiences are completely different experience in the old days and I would argue some portion as market where you have labs that are not nearly our size that can't make these investments so we are really excited about that. Second is the whole information flow, so my question is our app that allows the consumer, the patient to get access for the results we have 5 million users that continue to grow and we will provide more and more capability on that app to schedule appointment, to get your results and to do other things in your healthcare going forward. So we are excited about that. And third, as we bring new products to the marketplace, we've tested this over-the-counter, direct-to-consumer models in a number of states will realize there is a market where consumers want to directly order cholesterol testing or glucose testing, hemoglobin A1c or such transmitted diseases without going to physician. So we are going to grow that business as well. So you put that altogether and what you are going to get from Quest Diagnostics is completely different experiences of different set of capabilities in a brand but consumers will recognize and as healthcare continues to evolve, where more and more choice will give to consumer who they use, they can look for the best value and we offer the best value on the planet. We are proud of that and it's getting better every day. Now the second part of this is related to you take all that data and you take that experience and you combine it with healthcare services and retail healthcare services are the basic healthcare services. This is where we have an amazing capability, we have over 10,000 phlebotomists, we have over 10,000 healthcare workers that going home already you mentioned our life insurance business, our wellness business. And so, those 20,000 employees and also with their other let's just call it operational capabilities are 3500 per years and our cost centers can be applied in managing lives in a better way and so the ambition we have with our partner with Wal-Mart and other partners is to take our gain up, point us in direction and provide those healthcare services to surround those lives in a more efficient effective way and typically as we know in healthcare 5% of the population and 50% of cost and we believe with better data, with better oversight over those individuals in a convenient good access location, we can do something about it and we have a lot of assets to bring the table. And so, this is what we called our data in extended care service portion of our strategy and obviously we are going to need some partners we benched in a few and I'm sure there is going to be many others because healthcare is local I mean what we do and different space will be different, so we are excited about the prospects of leveraging our capabilities and we see this is where the market is going. It's all about the consumer, it's all about better quality, lower cost and we are nicely positioned in that respect.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Patrick. Good morning.
Patrick Donnelly: Hi, guys. Thanks. So with PAMA, I'll implement it, can you talk a bit about future pricing conversations with payers and the importance of price discipline from your end. It seems like this will give even more incentive to hold on price with private payer has given, your value proposition with smaller regional payers struggle a bit to deal with PAMA in their best in margin, so curious as to your perspective on that?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, why don't you take that?
Mark Guinan: Yes, I appreciate the question. I can assure you with that plenty of motivation to be price disciplined for many years. So it doesn't change that. I think that PAMA gives as I described in JP Morgan is that the payers now are understanding that the market is involving and this world where somehow the commercial rates for though independent labs obviously for a lot of the hospitals and some of the physician mandatories and so on, the rates that are still well higher CMS rates but certainly for the independent lab it's been lower and there is full transparencies that we can go under them and say here is the data that was collected by CMS you know, where the market is and so there is no one certainly around where ratings are compared with the rest of the commercial market and therefore let's talk about what's there, let's talk about how we partner together in the long run you know, that we succeed and failed together. So I might feel good to try to get some sort of price concession in the short run, but you know, that's not your best long-term interest because we are part of the solution, we give the best value you know, that when you drive more volume through one of the national labs, it's much better than it's going somewhere else. Everything from the data we provide to the services that Steve mentioned, which differentiate as per many of the other providers and obviously to the cost. So, much more of an opportunity to talk partnership, get the conversation away from price or if anything, get the conversation towards, we need prices to migrate towards that need. You can't have a subset that's significantly lower and a subset significant higher getting to an average everyone is kind of be in a market price, which ultimately is what CMS wants to get to, so that enables the conversation to enhance the conversation that we've been having for several years. It doesn't change our motivation which has been very strong and if you look at what we've accomplished over the last couple of years, we did significantly mitigate the prices that we are facing four, five years ago through that discipline and when we talked about the fact that some prices aren't sufficient then we will walk away from volume if we don't feel that's appropriate. Not volume at any price it's like greater than therefore we have shown a desire, willingness and descended our value proposition to those payers and I think we are viewing the results.
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Good morning. This is perhaps a somewhat related question, but can you talk about managed care contracting environment and what assumption you have in your guidance for 2018, is that any regarding a large managed care exclusive contracts in the industry and then also if no assumption baked in, what impact you would anticipate could occur? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so for '18 I assume the continuation of our setup if you will with our access through the national players as well as through the regional players. I would argue that our access through healthcare insurance has gotten better over the years and obviously our objective which we talked about is to continue to get a better test 2018 to 2019. So what I'm saying in that regard is we can see you enjoy from a national exclusivity relationship with Aetna that's implied in our guidance for 2018 we feel good about that relationship is potential merger with CVS, we think it is an interesting development that might happen. We have a strong working relationship with CVS as well, so feel good about that and that's assumed in our guidance for '18. Second is we talk about that is how we know that a contract with United, with our largest dependent expires in '18. We love to get access through United as one of the national partners. We've described that we are working on that, we feel good about progress make. We have nothing to share there, but we continue to be hopeful that as we enter '19 we will have strong access and we do have access already with United Lives as another network provider in some states and for some carve-out plans that they have, and as I mentioned, the relationship continues to get stronger. We've announced a strategic relationship with Optum lifecycle management that continues to go well. Optum continues to buy physician practices that depending on our biggest customers in those physician practices so that will continue to build. And then, throughout the rest of our hundreds of contracts we have, you should assume in '18 that we have good expansion of those, and good - continuation of those and the price assumption that Mark talked about is the continuation of the access to our many partners we have throughout the United States.
Mark Guinan: And just to add to that specifically interesting question. We gave a pretty broad range 3% to 5%. So 200 basis points, so well I can't tell you explicitly what that means for getting that in the United or any other sort of potential changes. I can tell you that it's likely covered within that range whatever scenario might happen in within 2019 and beyond and then if we do get to appoint where there is something to share as Steve mentioned we will consider some change like that materially offset. We would communicate in a very time with fashion like you know, what's going on at that point and obviously give you some idea of what we think it might mean and then obviously as we got further in the year, we are planning another Investor Day in the call. We will give more detailed update on what the specs are as we near given everything we know at that time.
Operator: Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citibank. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you can talk a little bit about expectations around, wage growth just given tight labor market. Do you expect pressures there and then maybe what you see is underlying wage growth over kind of the next couple of few years?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. Ralph, we continue to look at our competitiveness of our wages to our broad workforce we employ about 45,000 people many of which are frontline employees. We believe we've been competitive in the past and the expectation for 2018 is the inflation we have on wage bill is about what we've been running at. Matter of fact, we track attrition of our employees and we put a lot of time in energy into retaining our employees. So we've actually spent a lot of time as a management team looking at the other aspects like people come to work around things like scheduling and the environment and their supervisors and so actually we've seen a slight reduction in our attrition of employees so forget about the value proposition we have on employees. And then prospectively, we think employees until has have better and better about working across diagnostics we run an engagement survey where we have a phenomenal participation rate about 90% of employees show up in a survey. And our engagement course for 2017 has never been higher; they are much higher than in '16. So we had nice pickup in engagements course and as you see in our announcement this morning we want to thank all those employees because these are the frontline employees in many aspects, so we have more attrition in other places that has helped us through this journey we've been on and so the $500 recognition that we are going to provide this year that's tagged to companywide initiatives. We think we will again get a lot of this people a good feeling about working at Quest, so we want to thank them for their hard work. So 2018 is above what you see in the past in terms of inflationary pressure on our wage though.
Mark Guinan: And to answer I think probably an impressive question, a many of our wage employees earn about, where at the middle of wages are targeted to end up, we also you know, obviously have many week employees who are not in the states or the cities that have this increase in minimum wage. So we are already above that market. If you are thinking about minimum wage and so when we look at the pressure on our wages certainly that's not a huge factor. But, the timing of the labor force is going to bring, unknown. But at this point, we've not experienced any dramatic pressure. To Steve's point certainly wages are one part of the equation, but we also provide health benefits for our employees and it's highly valued. And then the work experience itself is greatly improving. I'll give you one example, a lot of the investments we're making in our peaks and service as Steve referenced through enablement, we are also doing some of significant refresh to those centers, updating them et cetera. That makes phlebotomists work experience much more positive as well. They're really like not having to handle as many of administrative duties, they now can be done electronically and they can focus on phlebotomy, so there're other things that we're doing to offset some potential wage pressure but certainly we addressed where we needed to. So, market adjustments and we're not exposed heavily to inflation from general wage increases because we already generally pay a lot of our people at that minimum wage.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Kevin Ellich: Hey guys, just a quick follow-up, Mark you made a comment in your prepared remarks about to-date in Q1, you have experienced nearly as much weather impact as you did last year, wondering I mean how should we think about that in terms of volume impact or on year-over-year comp, I mean is it just really due to the cold and minorities or cold throughout the country?
Mark Guinan: Yes, well, it's been nature's cold. I mean, we had precipitation events, you had [indiscernible] in Northern Florida, though certainly we had a number of weather events from ice to snow in areas which is unusual to some snow in Massachusetts and then some cold, although we know it's hard to really attribute cold, I mean, there are some times when it's been so cold where everything is closed, schools are shut down and so on. But generally cold, warm I guess some impact, we don't really calculate on our weather. So weather is more we see a day, weather is something going on that it have its travel to the extent that we look at that day's activity, we say, "Hey, there's definitely an impact, this is out of the norm," and so it's - there are some to that calculation, but we've been doing it long enough that we feel it's directionally crap. We just wanted people to be aware as they're thinking about the modeling from a various quarters that we don't know what the next couple months are going to blame, but last year January was pretty benign. We didn't get our weather until later in the quarter, and this year we've already had handful of weather events that kind of puts us already where we were for the full quarter last year.
Operator: At this time, we're showing no further questions on the phone line.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our Website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy, which continues to drive results. Then Mark will provide more detail and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance. Well, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth in spite of some weather challenges. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and then yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic that includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab. Here are some highlights from this quarter. Revenues were $1.93 billion up 2.4%, reported EPS of $1.15 was down 14% from 2016, adjusted EPS grew 150 basis points to a $1.39, which includes an increase of $0.02 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 primarily reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as our recently closed acquisitions. Before I describe the progress, we have made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I'd like to discuss PAMA. We continue to urge CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA to take the time to get it right. The preliminary rates that CMS released are not market-based rates as Congress indicated. Unfortunately, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prohibited from reporting their rates. Also based on data submitted through CMS, Quest alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data CMS collected. As you're aware from previous days, our estimated share of the Medicare market is less than 15%. Instead of protecting access to essential laboratory testing, this flawed approach could greatly compromise Medicare beneficiaries access to testing. A large portion of the Medicare population receives their services from small laboratories and PAMA could put them at risk. We've been collecting facts that demonstrate the many ways that CMS has disregarded the intent of Congress and we've been finding the receptive audience among legislators and policymakers in Washington DC for our call to take more time to get the implementation right. The clinical lab industry is a critical element in the healthcare and economic landscape of this country, creating jobs, driving economic activity and generating tax revenues for the federal and state governments. Our trade association's recent economic study found that this industry directly and indirectly employs over 600,000 people that contributes $13 billion in tax revenues. The impacts of these proposed cuts are far-reaching to this vital industry. These rates should not be finalized as proposed and this view is shared by 22 respected medical societies and health groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and the American Hospital Association is very much back of our plan. In October, we -- on October 6, sent a letter with these leading voices in healthcare, calling for CMS to take immediate action to address the significant deficiencies in its progress to establish new clinical laboratory payment rates. Along with our trade association, we are exploring every option to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to diagnostic information services. In whatever form CMS might implement PAMA, Quest will be prepared and we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day. Mark will touch on this later. Turning to the progress we've made in the third quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we're on track to achieve for the fifth consecutive year. We had a very productive quarter. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory, which we will further strengthen -- which further strengthens our position in the New York metropolitan market. Yesterday we and also announced the acquisition of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic. This lab will become our advanced diagnostic center of expertise in cardiovascular testing, an agreement build on our existing relationship with the Cleveland Clinic. Our M&A pipeline remains very strong and our strategy is delivering growth. With the acquisitions we've completed this year and those expected to close by the end of 2017, we are well-positioned to exceed our long-term M&A objective for 2018 and of course in accretion realized from the deals in 2018 will help offset the potential impact of new Medicare rates. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationship with hospital systems. Our relationship with PeaceHealth is progressing well. As you recall the relationship includes the acquisition of the outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska. This relationship is fully operational and already contributing revenues and adjusted earnings growth. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. In the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise and we are very pleased with the integration efforts to date. In women's health we continue to be excited about the progress we've made in noninvasive prenatal screening. Our Q-Natal test is providing strong double-digit growth year-over-year. We recently complimented our women's health offering with QHerit, a screening panel that helps both women and men across multiple identify the risk of passing 22 genetic diseases to their children. We also introduced the cholesterol test with an improved method for assessing heart disease risk in aiding treatment decisions. Unlike most lipid tests that does not require fasting and patient's life is added convenience. We all made progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in 128 stores and are expected to open about 30 more before the end of 2017. In addition, our collaboration with Walmart will open new locations in 2017. In this exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer, are MyQuest mobile application is now delivering lab results into the hands of 4.5 million users. Payers are taking notice of the progress we are making on our consumer strategy, especially with convenience, value and the number of access points we provide. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. We're building a solid pipeline with data analytics with a number of partners interested in leveraging our data, including pharma, CRO and health plan customers. Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion to invigorate run rate savings as we exit 2017. As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. Over 950 of our 2,200 patient service centers are live with e-check-in, which improves the patient experience. Our total e-check-in volume is over 12 million encounters to date. We expect to have this capability in most of our patient service centers by the end of this year. Now let me turn it over to Mark who'll take you through our financial performance in detail. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. Starting with revenue, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion were up 2.4% versus the prior year. We estimate the impact of the recent hurricanes reduced our revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than what we had estimated in late September. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 2.8% compared to the prior year with approximately 140 basis point attributed to recent acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 1.6% versus the prior year of which about 60 basis points was organic. However, note that the impact of hurricanes presented a headwind of approximately 140 basis points to volume in the quarter. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter grew by 1.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder revenue per rep is not proxy for price. It includes the number of variables such as unit price variation testament and test per rep. Here price headwinds in the third quarter remain less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate through the final quarter of 2017 and consistent with the last several quarters. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our PLS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed to the slightly more than the positive 100 to 200 basis point trend we've observed for several quarters. Reported operating income for the quarter was $298 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $322 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $325 million or 16.8% of revenues compared to $320 million or 17% of revenues last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes produced adjusted operating by approximately $18 million in the third quarter, which adversely impacted operating income growth by nearly six percentage points. Excluding the impact of the hurricane, adjusted operating income would have grown more than 7% and adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.15 in the quarter versus a $1.34 in the prior year period. As noted previously, our third quarter 2016 results included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition. Adjusted EPS was $1.39 up 2% from a $1.37 last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.08 or nearly 6%. The company recorded net after-tax charges totaling $20 million in the third quarter or $0.14 per diluted share, representing system conversion, restructuring, integration and other one-time costs. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 36% versus 33% last year. Last year's rate benefitted from the previously mentioned Escrow recovery, which was nontaxable. In the quarter, we recorded approximately $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation or SBC compared to $3 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year. Year-to-date we've reported $36 million or $0.25 per share of excess tax benefits associated with SBC, which is an increase of $0.20 year-over-year. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4% flat versus last year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. Turning to cash provided by operations, we generated $852 million in 2017 year-to-date versus $765 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $170 million compared to $165 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.71 billion, an increase of about 2.6% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS to be between $4.87 and $4.92 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.67. Cash provided by operations remains at approximately $1.2 million and finally capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Despite the impact of recent hurricanes, our full year revenue guidance is in line with our prior outlook and operating cash flow guidance remains unchanged. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the approximate $0.08 hurricane impact noted previously, the impact from recently closed acquisitions, a $0.02 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC recorded in the third quarter and a small but ongoing impact from hurricane Maria on our quarterly cooperation in the fourth quarter. It's also important to remember that despite these headwinds just mentioned, our updated guidance is in line with or exceeding the outlook we provided to you at the beginning of 2017. While we aren’t prepared to providing 2018 guidance at this time, we want to remind you that we do not expect the same levels of excess tax benefits associated with SBC in 2017 to recurrent next year. Therefore, as you think about 2018, we would encourage you to focus on our 2017 EPS guidance, excluding the $0.20 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC and assume the same $0.06 we saw in 2016 as a jump-off point for 2018. Finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our long-term outlook, which we had reaffirmed today. Recall at 2016 Investor Day, we provided a long-term outlook from 2017 through 2020, which included a revenue CAGR of 3% to 5% with 1% to 2% growth expected from acquisitions. It also included an adjusted earnings CAGR faster than revenue in the mid to high single-digit range. Note that this earnings outlook contemplated a starting point of $5.15 and adjusted EPS in 2016 and did not include any tax benefits associated with SBC beyond the base level of $0.06 recorded in 2016. This outlook implies adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $7 by 2020, excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with SBC. With regard to PAMA, the cost in the current proposed fee schedule are deeper than expected. If the proposed fee schedule is finalized as its currently stated, we remain confident that we can achieve our long-term outlook, while our earnings outlook is more likely to be at the lower end of the range we provided. That said, M&A activity beyond our 1% to 2% growth target represents potential update to this outlook. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. We've summarized a very busy and productive quarter we turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as the impact of recently closed acquisitions. And then finally, we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions, operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Isaac Ro: Good morning, guys. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Isaac.
Isaac Ro: Hey Steve. So, both questions I had for you were longer term in nature if I may. First one had to do with market share. If we assume that you're not able to convince the regulators to push back timing of implementation, could you talk a little bit about how quickly you think the marketplace will start to react to the new pricing reality and what does that mean for your ability to start trying to take some market share in the next six to 12 months?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah thanks Isaac. Well first of all we've been in the consolidation mode as far as our strategy for the past five years, a significant part of our growth strategy is to get that 1% to 2% of growth through acquisition. What you see from us this quarter is we announced two acquisitions, puts us in that range of 1% to 2% for 2017 and while we said that puts us in a very good place for 2018. So, our acquisition strategy continues to be part of our consolidation strategy. We continue to see interest in companies or laboratories looking at their strategic options and so we believe that's still a good part of our strategy. And then secondly, is we're confident that our guide proposition in the marketplace is really second to none. Our value of how we deliver our services is very strong in the marketplace from a quality and our service. You couple that with what we're doing on our consumer strategy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the convenience of what we're doing moving around our enablement of the whole process and are our better and better access for the consumer. Our value proposition of the marketplace is quite strong. And so, I also mentioned Isaac is that payers are taking notice to that and if you look at our assets today through our health plan relationships, it's really much stronger than what we've had in the past that will continue to build and as we get that better access we health insurance companies, we will continue to grow faster than the market place, both through acquisitions and organically. So, tracking well with our plan to accelerate growth and we believe that that is the right strategy for us going into the future. So, thanks for the question.
Isaac Ro: Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on I think Mark's comment at the end around long-term guidance and if I go back to your 2015 Analyst Day you talked about EPS growth in the mid-to-high single digits, you're staying with the current outlook maybe more towards the lower end of the range. Could you articulate how much of that you think will come from M&A versus organically and just trying to understand the importance of M&A in achieving that new outlook, thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Sure Isaac. So, I was qualifying that we would be in the lower end if PAMA moved forward under the currently proposed fee schedule. So obviously while the things we've shared we're trying to influence that. So, at this point we're not locked into that. What we're saying is that would be the likely outcome or the cost to be a significant or seeing in the original proposal, but we're obviously commenting on that and there is still some more work to be done to see where that settles down. So, I wouldn't say at this point we're signaling the lower end. We're just saying there is significant impact and impairment while we certainly contemplated that with that outlook in November of 2016. That's why we gave a range. This is in the high end of what we might have expected coming our CMS. So, I would not lock into that at this point. In terms of M&A other than the deal that we have already executed, do not have any earnings projections that are based on future M&A. Certainly in our revenue, we've talked about getting 1% to 2%, but we all know that it takes a period of time generally 12 to 18 months before you get to a run rate level of earnings contribution. So, in that mid to high single digits, so I am not counting on significant contributions from unexecuted M&A on the bottom line only on the revenue side.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You line is open.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Thanks guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Kevin.
Kevin Ellich: I guess I want to go back to PAMA, in the press release you talked about exploring every option in terms of you guys and the lab industry exploring every option to make sure Medicare beneficiaries have access to lab services. What options do you have I guess on top of that more importantly, if PAMA is implemented as written, what impact you think that'll have on commercial rates going forward?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. I'll take this. The first part of that question I'll give to Mark for the second part. So, we're actively working this and we've been working on it for years as we talked about. We've people engaged with the CMS on the implementation PAMA in the quarter and the principles of that we don't disagree which is market-based pricing for the refresh of the fee schedule. But while we've been helping them was but unfortunately, we think with what we've the draft rates they got wrong. We've been helping with the implementation of gathering the data to make sure the data is correct and then working through the competition of the data to establish new rates. So, we've hard at work with them three years, but I'll share with you since we got the draft rates we have provided them feedback on where we see -- where we have questions or where we see some issues with what we see so far with the draft rates and so they listen to that and that's the first part of how we're engaging in this. Second is before we saw the draft rates and now since we see the draft rates for all over our congressional leaders to make sure they understand the difference of what CMS has proposed from those rates versus what the intention was with PAMA and we feel good about the receptivity of that and also, we've been engaged with the administration on that as well. So, hitting all branches of government and that we're very active. We'll cement our formal covenants of the trade association and I'll say trade association all partners and all members of the trade association were actively engaged in that and that will go in before the deadline, which is October 23. I'll also tell you that other trade associations are deeply engaged in this. The device trade association appalment is deeply engaged in this. The smaller laboratories are engaged, the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, I said that in my comments are deeply engaged and so we have a lot of support broadly, and then also employees are deeply engaged. We have grassroots, mailings going into congressmen and women and centers throughout all the different states telling and urging CMS that they need to take the time to get it right. So that's happening. We'll see what CMS does with this feedback. The schedule says the world then people comments into consideration and to give us the final rates in November, we'll see. They could decide to take the time to get it right and to like the implementation. We're not sure whether they will or will not do that. If they go forward with the rates, we'll see what that means and what the comments to take into consideration and then we would need to consider legislative action depending upon what we see there with the help of the Congress members that we have been speaking to. And then also what we're looking at two of the trade association is what legal alternatives we might have in the event that they go forward with final rates that clearly do not represent the congressional intent of PAMA. So that's what we mean by exploring all options and as you could tell from my commentary we're all over this and I'm not along to get a lot of help from my colleagues in the trade association. So, I feel very good about the effort we're putting into this and CMS is hearing loud and clear that we believe that long and they need to take the time to get it right. So, Mark, do you want to talk about commercial rates?
Mark Guinan: So, Kevin, so couple things. First off as we shared previously, we had very little of our commercial contracts revenue tied to floating rates. We've been cleaning that over the last couple years in anticipation for some reductions in MAA. So, it's a very small portion and we very soon not have any contracts that are in any way floating an index MAA. In terms of predicting the future, it's always hard to predict the future, but I can assure you that in the conversations with the large payers recently, they understand the significant impact of those trends in industry and certainly to us and they actually have entity for that, so versus it being an opportunity to take advantage of that and the messaging being we want to keep this ratio to Medicare. Of course, the conversation as you understand the intent of this is to incorporate commercial rates and Medicare rates. So that is an impossibility. So, at the end of the day, you're going to be basically in the same curve as the Medicare rates and given the significant impact and the fact that largely they agree with our premise that we are part of the solution on laboratory spending and pay significantly more to other providers of laboratory diagnostic and patient services. And also, were a part of the solution in terms of overall healthcare spend given the amount of influence that we have our data. Many people say one to two thirds of the other spend that we're actually all of our good guys and a good partner. So, they understand that and they you look for us to be successful and so the tenor of the discussions around price, I can assure you has not gotten worse given PAMA and certainly become neutral or got better in most cases. So, should not expect any significant commercial price erosion going forward and just to remind people, we shared before, all our labs are typically paid one and half to two times but we're paying and then hospital laboratories are often 2.5 times or more the same rate. So, I would expect some evolution in that over time as opposed to looking for credit concessions from the independent national labs.
Kevin Ellich: Great. And then just really quickly, Steve any thoughts on the utilization environment and organic volume trends?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. Look what we've said in the past we'll say this quarter again, we feel stable. We look at all the different indications in the marketplace and overall if you look at the amount of healthcare people are using in this country and what we see from our established accounts, we feel stable. We feel good about our organic revenue growth in the quarter. We do look at to the effect that the larger storms over the third quarter had on us and we adjust for that. We actually feel very good about the progress we're making accelerating growth. So, we're making progress in a stable marketplace to accelerate growth.
Kevin Ellich: Great. Thanks guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Mark, I wanted to drill little bit more into your commentary on the commercial pricing environment. Obviously, there's a negotiation of national payer contracts underway. Could you just give an update on your philosophy and those negotiations on price versus value proposition, versus network access and to your comments, you just gave as a low-cost provider, do you think you could actually push on commercial prices and offset if PAMA hold?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, yes Jack of course that's our strategy is to push to two-way negotiation. So, at this point, I am not going to speculate our -- I promise where that could end up, but yeah, that is the position that we're taking and you already have excellent rates and there are other people whose services arguably are little better in some cases are as good as we're providing given the fact that for example we provide all of our data to the payers and quite often they don't get the data from other people to provide laboratory services within their network. So that's one argument actually to get a better product. And then some of the things that Steve walked through in terms of the consumer experience that resonates because they're understanding that the outside customer which are your members and when they compete with other health plans there is certainly some value beyond the result of laboratory tests and the services that they provide and it can positively differentiate them if they bring some partner and work with us and see some of the value that we bring and the other providers don't. So that's part of our value proposition that we're discussing with them and I can assure you that over the last couple years we have gotten rate increases with some contracts given our value proposition explanation and that comes part and parcel with what I would call it try spirit of partnership whereas I said earlier, they see what part of the solution. So, the more they can field work to us, the better from some of those higher cost providers who arguably don't have good value given the service they provide, the better they're going to be and the more they're going to solve their laboratory spend. And as I said earlier appropriately drive the use of that data for other healthcare cost. So, I feel really good about the relationships that we've been building and any time of course there is everybody wants to maximize value in their side of the equation. But I think as I said earlier, the tenure of the discussions and the lot more in the spirit of partnerships with the health plan and there are more of more seeing us as part of the solution and that's what's going to help us to defend the value of the price that we offer today and into the future.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then if PAMA holds, would you push harder on cost savings in 2018? At that point I would be curious you had any updates on regional consolidation of the footprint and then just auto adjudication rollout to payers?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. So, we continue to drive on an invigorate despite PAMA and what we've shared and this has been our philosophy for filing out years that we need to continue to get better in what we do and better probably the both in quality and the service as well as efficiency. And as you see in our results we continue to get more efficient and we feel about tracking to that $1.3 billion goal. And if you recall in 2016 Investor Day, we said we're not done yet. So, we got a lot more in front of us. We provided some visibility in color to that in 2016. So, we see more beyond the $1.3 billion and so we were anticipating that there might be some more price pressure going into '18 and '19. So, what you see implied in our guidance is the continuation of invigorate test what we'll do this year and into 2018 along with just driving productivity in general. And when you go through the math based upon what we have said, obviously we feel strong. We've had the convenience of the outlook that we provided in our Investor Day in 2016 because we've been working so hard for years. It's not a new program we're going to the continuation of the existing program and we have more efficiency to get out of this organization.
Jack Meehan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Nick.
Nicholas Jansen: Hey guys. Good morning. Just two questions for me. First just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into margin trends and expectations as we think about PAMA being rolled out over the next two years. Certainly, you're showcasing very nice progress in 2017 on margins, I think up 50 basis points in the most recent quarter ex hurricane. So just wanted to get your sense is 2017 peak margin year and how we think about if you analyze the next three years, how much does margin degrade associated with PAMA, thanks?
Mark Guinan: Yeah Nick, so thanks for the question. The outlook that we gave is a CAGR. So that will be put as a CAGR. So, it's not year-to-year, we're not until we see some variability especially depending the way some of the PAMA cuts get rolled out. But with that said what we've committed to is growing earnings faster than revenues. So, by definition that we says that we expect to expand margins. So, then it may not be every quarter, it may not be every single year in the period year-over-year, but over the next several years we're looking for continued margin expansion because we're committed to growing our earnings faster now.
Nicholas Jansen: And just a clarification on that regarding the structure of PAMA, does that mean -- my understanding is that 2019 would be a worse year than 2018 as we think about the size of the headwind. Is that the right understanding?
Steve Rusckowski: The honest answer this point is I don't know because there are still so many things up in the air regarding how they're going to imply some of their rules and in pricing practices and without getting into too much detail because it's very complicated. But just in summary a lot of the billings to Medicare are panels and the way Medicare pays panel is very, very complicated and the more analyzing the panels, the more it impacts the overall price and it's not the positive fashion. So, they already have historically deviated from what people who are close to the industry might not understand which is you don't get in a way for every single analyze unless you start putting things together in a panel. So, the question we have is how our panels get paid and how we price which is the course to market because in many cases there is not a comparable code within the commercial world with a very, very complicated issue that we're trying to sort through and that's why even if at this point we were in a position to know and really interested in sharing the estimate by year, I don't have that answer. So still more to come. So, I would say at this point, do not assume that '19 is worse than '18 and vice versa. We will tell you as soon as we have people understanding to provide you some reliable information.
Nicholas Jansen: That's very helpful and then just one quick -- just a numbers question. I understand the tax dynamics the stock-based compensation benefit you're seeing this year. Any way you can just share what we should be plugging in for '18? Is it kind of the 35 to 37 range, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be modeling tax specifically in '18, thanks.
Mark Guinan: Yeah so, I am sure you understand that, what drives that is a couple of factors. As long as the share price is higher than it was at the time of the brand of the equity and that you're going to seek in some value. So certainly, when you see a year like 2017 where we had significant stock appreciation that was versus previous years that was driving a lot of this benefit. The other thing is option exercises, which of course we can't predict. So, we're investing performance shares investing that will drive some level of benefit consistently assuming that the stock price continues to appreciate to some degree, but we can't predict the timing of the option exercises, which is a huge variable. So, what I will say is the sixth sense that we shared when we say the base level assuming that the stock is stable and continues to go up to some degree that is pretty reliable but that's kind of be there, but the large swing is beyond that will be highly dependent on appreciation of the stock movement and the amount of option exercises and that's what we can't predict. So, I would say sixth sense and we'll continue to update if that change is kind of a base level you should consistently expect and anything beyond that is dependent on those other factors.
Nicholas Jansen: Thanks for all the detail guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk: Good morning, everybody.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Bill. Good morning.
Bill Quirk: So, you addressed the commercial rate in Medicare relationship with respect to Kevin's question. I was hoping you could comment on the percent of Medicaid business that's tied into Medicare rates and how you're thinking that -- thinking about that rather over the next couple of years assuming that PAMA goes into effect?
Steve Rusckowski: So, the best of our understanding, Medicaid rates are not largely tied in terms of being an index in terms of a mechanistic fashion. Certainly, they look at Medicare rates to make sense and the states set those rates. But it doesn’t look like there is a formulaic relationship in most cases again to the best of our understanding and we've looked at this pretty deeply and will automatically trigger changes in Medicaid. So that's going to be pretty much up to the states. And again, reminding you only about 2% or 3% of our revenues are paid by traditional Medicaid fee for service. A lot of the Medicaid are removed to management and the one thing that it won't say is that there are rules around the fact that Medicaid cannot pay more than Medicare. So, in any case where there is a state Medicaid rate where the fee for service is close to Medicaid and there is a Medicare reduction, you will see a reduction to ensure that Medicaid is not higher than Medicare. But beyond that at this point still more to learn, but I would not expect this will trigger significant reductions in state Medicaid rate and again given the small portion of our revenue that comes from 3% Medicaid, I wouldn't expect it to be a major headwind for us.
Bill Quirk: Okay. No, I appreciate the color around that, thank you. And then just separately can you guys comment on I guess the consumer outreach programs that you have with Safeway and Walmart and help us think a little bit about the relative profitability of those as compared to say your traditional draw station and traditional diagnostics business, thanks?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah Bill thanks. It's our consumer strategy and I outlined the five elements of our growth strategy one of which is to be most consumer oriented laboratory and there are multiple facets as far as that is concerned. One is we're putting a lot of work and e-enabling our whole consumer process and we're talking about e-check-in. So, moving really our experience that we have our consumers to contemporary experiences that people experience in the consumer world. Making a lot of progress there. The feedback is great. It helps patients. It helps our employees and as I mentioned, our healthcare insurance partners feel great about their experience as well because they're working on that. The second is around information. We got MyQuest, we have 4.5 million users, which is a phenomenal number given that we only brought this to the marketplace in a little over two years. So, it's just picking up the volume of users that we have and we put more and more content around that and also want people to navigate into our whole experience through MyQuest, which is a nice consumer touch if you will. The third is around products. We see a lot more from us and we have direct to consumer testing. We mentioned we tested this in our marketplace last year. We're bringing this into Missouri and Colorado. We're actually are encouraged by some of the early returns that consumers are interested in paying out of pocket from their own ordered diagnostic test. It could be cholesterol, it could be hemoglobin, glucose or such are transmitted, but there is a market there and so we're going at that market. And the last place we're investing in which is what you -- and that is a bit part of your questions is what we're doing around access and I'll say access because it's important that we have access for our draw stations. And so, we're looking at how we can augment and in some place, replace our patient service centers with some of these locations at Safeway. We’re making excellent progress of implementing patient service centers in those Safeway stores and also relationship with Walmart. And so, we will open some centers in Walmart in Florida and Texas this year. And so, what they have allowed to do is by zip code is look at where we have access points and in some cases, we can consolidate what we have in those stores. And that allows us to get more efficiency in some cases around the real estate cost but also around phlebotomist productivity. The biggest cost of drawing is not real estate it’s the labor, it’s a phlebotomist. So, if we can have more density of phlebotomists in better locations and convenient locations that serve the consumer better, better off we’re go to be. Remember a lot of our patient service centers even though we have unparalleled access the 2,200 patient service centers and we have over 3500 phlebotomists in physician’s offices so close to 6,000 access points. Our medical office buildings and these are not nearly as convenient locations is where you'll find a Safeway store and where if you find a Walmart with big wide-open parking lots, easy access to the store and ability to do some shopping and other activities around that experience. So, we’re quite encouraged. We think we’re on the track again as we talked earlier, our value proposition to the healthcare value proposition is we want to be the most consumer-oriented laboratory. And we think our value proposition is getting stronger and stronger every day because we’re focused on this. So, we're making a lot of good progress. Operator, next question.
Operator: Our next question is from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Jacoby: Thanks. Good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ralph.
Ralph Jacoby: Hi, just wanted to understand and clarify the jumping off point for 2017, the midpoint of guide I guess is $5.65, we’ve got the $0.10 from the hurricane, so it’s $5.75. We take out the $0.20 for the tax benefit we're at $5.55 and then ex panel we essentially grow that mid to high single digits, is that -- just want to make sure if that’s right?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, so the jumping off point shouldn’t be adjusted for the hurricane, but you may argue that the year-over-year growth compare is easier given the fact that we had hurricanes in 2017. So, the jumping off point you're right takes the midpoint of our guidance and take out the $0.20 and that's out of the way we are thinking our starting point given that at this point we would project only $0.06 of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. And that’s how we would build our initial plan for 2018 and certainly taking into account that the hurricane impact this year, that can give us an easier compare to next year.
Ralph Jacoby: Okay. That’s fair and then the -- that’s in the same context as the $6 to $7 number by 2020 right. So that's off that baseline that’s how we should be thinking about $6 to $7 for 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: Exactly. Not off the guidance that’s includes the $0.20 excess with stock-based comp around.
Ralph Jacoby: Okay. All right that’s helpful. And then I guess any help you can give on sort of based on your current mix. Can you give us the impact of the PAMA cuts for 2018, 2019 and 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: No as I said earlier – maybe wasn’t as clear as I intended to be given that there are so many things that have to be sorted out. So many unanswered questions we're still trying to figure out obviously looked at it deeply and we have a huge range of potential outcomes depending on the answers to some of those questions. So, it would not be helpful at this point to share that information as I said in a minute we expect to get more clarity in the not too distant future as soon as we're in a position to share something we’ll certainly do so.
Ralph Jacoby: Okay. And then just…
Mark Guinan: With that said we obviously have reconfirmed our views on outlook and the view outlook took into consideration what we saw in the draft rates. And so, our feedback to CMS is that there is a lot of areas that we think they got wrong and therefore we think the rates are too low. So, we think as we contemplate what we just shared with you this morning we are confident we feel with those outlook despite what might happen or not happen given our dialogue with CMS.
Ralph Jacoby: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just last one, can you give us a sense of multiples you’re paying for deals and maybe how you approach a purchase price just given what likely maybe a lower future earnings stream from whatever you’re acquiring given PAMA? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Sure. We've shared that we have very robust specific metrics around evaluating our deals that involves a return to invested capital metric where it would be accretive by the third year relative to our plan of record and we have a plan of record based on our performance shares. So, every year we put forward our forecast for our return on invested capital for the base business and half of our performance shares our based on that. So, we need to do deal that are accretive to do that by the third year. And we have also have an MPV metric and obviously the MPV level that needs to be exceeded before you will consummate a deal. So, the multiple question is a tough one because their P&L generally has no relationship to our P&L as I shared at the Investor Day. I went through actually Strawman example and in most cases, it’s not all of their revenues are higher than ours. When the business becomes part question, we get paid at the rates at which we negotiated, but the cost structure is so dramatically different than despite that revenue and synergies, we still significantly make more margin typically then the individual. So, taking a multiple of their P&L really does not make any sense as we shared the revenue multiple look like -- they look a great deal based on when it was in their hands and the earnings multiples, or EBITDA multiples look like we way overpaid it, but it's really not meaningful. If you look at our pro forma, you would see multiples that are the opposite, which says based on the earnings it was good and based on the revenue maybe you paid a little bit too much, but we cannot pay significantly more than our current enterprise multiple because by definition the math doesn’t work and then we’re not able to hit that rolling target. So, when we actually use return on invested capital, not our cost of capital, which some other companies use to evaluate deals so in fact we have a risk premium built into our MPV and built into our return expectations that we think make sense that's good for our shareholders.
Ralph Jacoby: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Amanda.
Amanda Murphy: Hey. How are you good morning?
Steve Rusckowski: Good.
Amanda Murphy: Just a quick question on the long-term outlook and obviously there has been discussion around contract renewals repair perspective and I think you gave some perspective there just in terms of pricing over the long-term but I just wanted to clarify in terms of the long-term outlook how you're thinking about some of the major contract changes are you including any assumptions there. And then also just thinking about capital deployment in terms of share buybacks can just help us think about how you're thinking about that over the long-term specially given PAMA? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start the contracting. We obviously want to have the best access as possible and I said in my earlier comments that we should really good about our growing access and it’s helping us accelerate in growth and that continues to be our strategy going forward as you are aware one of the nationals that we don't have our preferred relationship is united what we shared in the past we know that contract expires in 2018 with our nearest competitor. And as we said we would like to be on contract with United and our relationship continues to be strong in building so we did contemplate in our outlook is growing capability for us to have many of your insurances also on network then what we currently enjoy. And so that is contemplated in outlook and Mark second part of the question.
Mark Guinan: So, Amanda we’re going to stick with our capital deployment strategy in terms of earnings growth being low to actually mid to high single-digit that is earnings that’s not earnings per share so does contemplate significant buybacks two step earnings-per-share as well as earnings from cash And so, we will continue our strategy which says in the near-term accretive opportunities that used of that cash to do M&A that will be a priority once we satisfy that majority of free cash flow back to our shareholders as we’ve talked about before the dividend gets a long way towards that objective and use of supplemental share buybacks to get at least to 50%. Our free cash flow again with the other 50% of our free cash flow will be opportunity dependent if we have M&A that will be the preference and if we don't have M&A then that is a better use of cash and we will buy back more shares. But at this point the outlook does not include a reduction in our way so to get to higher levels of earnings. The growth rate that I share at the CAGR is real earnings.
Amanda Murphy: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, I think Jack has done some good work in terms of looking at the regional dynamics of PAMA in the first year just given that we're going to switch from a regional to more of a national schedule. So, I don't know if you've been able to look at that yet and if there is any mitigation there for you guys and based on your mix I know early in terms of the data but just looking for some insights into maybe what the first share might look like relative to the reported rate for you?
Steve Rusckowski: You're correct. That is a mitigation and any sort of price declines from the NOA because there are some reasons that we're already paying less than NOA. So, by definition there's less of a decrease at least in the first year depending on what the overall cuts might be over a multiyear period.  And actually, on that note that is the issue with the panel. So, in the case of any of the panels, if you added up the individual components in there NOA, we've not been getting paid that total amount. So that would also be a mitigation assuming that they don't change into some sort of other methodology. So that's what makes it a little bit complicated, but I did want to acknowledge that if you just look at the fee schedule and tried to say okay if the Medicare revenues are X and it looks like and this isn’t the case. Every code was reduced by 10% if I can do the math. Now it's a lot more complicated than that because in most cases, we're not getting paid NOA for the work that we do for Medicare.
Amanda Murphy: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. So, I don't want to beat the dead horse. So, I am just going to go back to that $6 to $7 answer to 2020. So, I just want to clarify what's included and what's not. So, it includes the proposed rates for PAMA as stated in the rule and it includes only 1% to 2% M&A annually. It includes an increase in your cost entry program, and if it does can you tell us exactly how much just for modeling purposes? It includes some share revolve but not a lot and then whether UNH contract if you're not let in it, I mean I'm assuming that if it's in you have some type of visibility and if it's not, can you let us know the downside risk, thanks?
Mark Guinan: So, let me clarify so on the efficiency program, I wouldn't model in a significant change from what we've been doing. I think Steve said that there is more to be done and then certainly we'll continue to deliver significant efficiencies, so that's part and parcel with the outlook that we gave. Now with that said of course depending on the PAMA outcome, the timing of it and how severe it is, we're going to do what we need to do. So, we're going to get to that outlook. We have enough levers to pull that we're very comfortable and we're not reaffirming the outlook if weren’t confident that we have the ability to do that despite where PAMA might come out. And certainly, in this case, where we have the plan and it contemplates the worst-case scenario which is what they proposed. And then in terms about the share buybacks. So, there will be some share buybacks, but I think a lot of that is really just to prevent dilution given our equity program. So, I wouldn't assume that any reduction in ways. So that is not in my outlook for this point. As I said again that growth is in earnings. And therefore, at this point given all other factors you should assume that earnings per share for both earnings and then depending on that's where to create value that could vary because we get more M&A and because we do more share buybacks. And yes, the 1% to 2% is what we're counting on, but while we're signaling back to it's original question is we think although we've been doing consolidation, this could be a trigger for acceleration in the consolidation. So, we are just knowing that there could be an opportunity for an acceleration and for more M&A but I'm not modeling that in the outlook at this point.
Ann Hynes: Okay. And then the UNH question, so I'm assuming if you include in the guidance you have some type of visibility, and if you don't, can you just maybe give us some visibility what the downside will be?
Steve Rusckowski: Ann, my commentary was that we're working on it, but it's the current status quo is whether it stayed that way or not. We still feel confident with our outlook. Okay. So that's the way you should think about it is your current access is getting stronger. We are working to get it even stronger but our outlook contemplates staying where we are as well.
Ann Hynes: Okay. And then with PAMA in Washington, I appreciate all the efforts that you guys have done that you talking to Congressional people. You're commenting to CMS, but I feel like all of that was done beforehand. What do you think can change? Do you think CMS just wanted the common period? Do they need that to make a change? So, I am just trying to figure out like what would change in two months?
Steve Rusckowski: The big change let me give you a little color around this. So, when we went off around and talked to our members of Congress and Southerners and the administration, we explained our concern but it was a concern without a lot of facts and a lot of our stakeholders said well, I understand, but let's see what the data says. And so many of them were waiting for these draft rates. And so, the good news is the draft rates are out and the draft rates are severely flawed with the amount of data that was collected a very small percentage that is 1% with a lot of the data coming from ourselves, so the majority of the rates are based upon the large nationals and that was not the congressional intent. So, the data being out there and is helping us now get more momentum with our stakeholders to say well okay what these guys have been talking about before we have addressed, they were right, they really got along and their message around taking time to get it right we now understand. Now the question is what do we do about that. So strange way the draft rates have been helpful to move the dialogue along.
Mark Guinan: And one example, Ann, is the OIG in some of the reports over a month ago have said based on the definition of the applicable lab they were expecting about 5% of the labs, but close to 70% of the volume to be reflected. As you heard us say today only 1% of the labs actually ended up submitting for various reasons. So back to Steve's point around okay, I get your concerns, but we'll see where it comes out, certainly those kind of facts are weighing in the conversations we're having right now.
Steve Rusckowski: And the vast majority of the data they're looking after these drafts from the large laboratories and we know from Medicare data that roughly 50% of what they buy is laboratory services from hospital at which laboratories as well as physician office labs. And from the two large nationals, it's only 20% of their purchases roughly. So, the sampling is flawed and they need to take the time to get it right and the whole philosophy of PAMA is to make sure that they look at this different cost of served issue in this industry to make sure they're paying market based rates and those market base rates are not the rates of large nationals that generally have the density of large centers.
Ann Hynes: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you, Ann.
Operator: Our last question is from Lisa Gill with JPMC. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just had a question, Steve, you talked a little bit about United and potentially opening that out from the preferred relationship they have today. Would you anticipate that the same would happen with your Aetna relationship that time? Do you think that as you think about the world if you know that may believe preferred relationships don't work quite the way that they were intended back when they were assigned in the mid-2000s? Just how do we think about that dynamic one? And then two, if United has opened up, my assumption would be that you're probably getting some rates today that were non-network rates and so they would potentially be higher. Are you thinking that the volumes help to offset that when you're thinking about this, the equation of getting to that $6 to $7 in 2020?
Steve Rusckowski: Well first of all, in Aetna our relationship continues to be strong. Yes, we have preferred national relationship and we haven’t commented where we'll continue or not, but we do have one extended contract, which we feel good about and we've secured. And second, as far as our philosophy with all of your insurance companies, we do believe that it is good to have a smaller network and frankly given our value proposition, we actually like those contracts where we are on contract with other nationals, where we have the opportunity to compete for the business because when we do compete for the business, we do quite well. So philosophically and strategically that's the position we've taken and as you see three out of the five nationals do have both their competitor on par and we feel good about those relationships as there is a different approach. We feel great about that relationship and we're working with United. All of those supplies have different relationships and I'll remind you we spend a lot of time talking multinationals but a large part of our business is not with the nationals. We have a lot of regionals. We have hundreds of contracts and those contracts continue to provide great access for us as well. So, Lisa just to clear, yes, our network rates are higher and in some cases significantly higher than the network rates, but there is also some supplies that don't have that network benefit, typically they're falling short. So, we don't get paid quite the premium being out of network that some people might think because there's some work we receive that we do basically for free because we don't get paid for those full insurance. So, if we get any network in a plan where we're on a network, there is countervailing forces. One is the network rate obviously typically is lower than the other network rates but then for the supplies that didn't have that benefits we actually get paid. So, there will be certainly some pricing headwind offset by what we will consider to be significant volume increase for any time we get into a network where we were previously out of network, but it's not as large a price headwind that some people might come to surface.
Lisa Gill: Okay. And then Mark, if I could just ask one question, I know everything said about the future is not about the quarter, but I just want to understand two things, one would be around the pricing environment obviously pricing coming in a little stronger. Is that just a mix element or is there something else going on there would be first and then just second on the nonclinical down 4%, we expect it will be down around 2%. Is there anything else there that's worth calling out from a quarter perspective?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, as I shared in the prepared remarks, pricing continues to be less and on a apples-and-apples price and then we've also shared in the past that there was any mix element that suppresses revenue correct from our PLS business. So really when you look at the revenue per rep, it's the positive mix that we've experienced pretty consistently for several quarters, which is around the tax mix and then also then to the acquisitions where we tend to consistently have been growing our test per rep ratio. So those are the drivers. The other mix elements have been favorable more of our advanced diagnostic testing and then more test per acquisition have all set the negative mix impact of PLS on revenue per rep. When you look at the diagnostic services business, it's largely our risk assessment businesses. There is a couple of other things in there, but that's a big driver. That is the work we do for individuals who are looking to secure life insurance policies and in front of that is how independent on the industry itself and the number of policies that are being written and recently that's a little softer. So, it has nothing to do with the competitive environment per se losing the competition really have to do with the market and the market has slowed in full recently.
Lisa Gill: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. So, thanks again for joining us today. As we've said, we had another strong quarter in the third quarter 2017. We look forward to make our commitments and executing our two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. We thank you for your continued support and have a great day.

Shawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to reported EPS refers to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our Web-site. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2017 guidance. We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Here are some highlights. Revenues grew approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2.3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.37 was flat from 2016, and adjusted EPS grew approximately 16% to $1.55, which includes an increase of $0.08 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Based upon our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook for revenues, EPS, and cash from operations for the full year 2017. Before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, what I'd like to do is briefly discuss PAMA. This month, a number of ACLA Board members met with the executive branch as well as key members of the Senate Finance Committee, that means energy and commerce held subcommittees, reiterating our belief that the current regulation effectively excludes hospital outreach labs, which are a significant segment of the laboratory marketplace. Last month our trade associations sent a letter to CMS recommending postponing the calculation of publication of the new clinical and fee schedule redefining the definition of then applicable laboratory to ensure in a good hospital outreach laboratories and upon gathering data from hospital outreach laboratories publishing new clinical and fee schedule rates effective not earlier than July 1, 2018. While we support reform of the Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories. At this point, we have made a strong case to CMS and Congress. While we continue to believe that CMS has not carried out the congressional intent of PAMA, we recognize that a new clinical and fee schedule could be in place by January of 2018 and we will be prepared. Now let's review progress we've made executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. In the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we expect to achieve for the fifth consecutive year. We built out our leadership position in advanced diagnostics with our recently completed acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. On May 1, we completed our acquisition of the outreach operations at PeaceHealth Laboratories and began managing 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest. We began to recognize revenues from this acquisition in the POS agreement in the second quarter. Our existing professional lab services relationships with hospital systems such as RWJBarnabas, HCA, Montefiore, also continue to perform well and drive revenue growth. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point will not only accelerate Quest growth in U.S. oncology diagnostics but also host the promise of improving cancer care. Quest will become the preferred provider of the U.S. oncology diagnostics for the U.S. oncology network consisting of more than 1,400 independent community-based physicians. In addition, Quest will be a preferred provider of a full range of in-patient and out-patient diagnostic services for 12 hospitals of Baylor Scott & White Health in North Texas. Advanced diagnostics, including genetic and molecular-based tests as well as general diagnostics, grew in the quarter. Drivers of advanced diagnostics growth include Q-Natal, which is our offering for non-invasive prenatal screening, core infectious disease testing and Quantiferon TB testing were part of the growth. Within general diagnostics, prescription drug monitoring and Hepatitis C screening continued strong double-digit growth. We recently expanded our tumor profile offer through IBM Watson Genomics for Quest Diagnostics to include a 50 gene panel. With this enhanced insight, doctors can take more informed actions for treatment and feel more certain about the best path forward. Finally, last week we launched QHerit, a new genetic screening service that provides women and men with insight into genetic risk of passing on heritable disorders on to their offsprings. We also made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in over 100 stores. We still have clear line of sight to be operating in 200 stores and now expect to reach that number by mid-2018. Patient satisfaction and convenient scores are above 90% for our Safeway locations and feedback from these sites remains overwhelmingly positive. We can't say it any better than two recent feedbacks we have received from our customers on our Safeway locations. One from a network member from Alexandria, Virginia recently wrote, 'I really like the location of this Quest center at Safeway, it saves me time, grocery shopping, pharmacy, plus blood test, all in the same location.' And my personal favorite is one from Longmont, Colorado where a customer goes on to say, 'the best blood draw I've ever had, you rock.' Now this is an exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer. More and more people are taking control of their health and asking to receive their lab results in the palm of their hand. More than 4 million patients are receiving their lab results through our MyQuest mobile application, and we are on track to reach 5 million users by the end of 2017. And then finally, in late June we announced our collaboration with Walmart to help improve access to care and over time help lower healthcare cost of providing basic health care services. The collaboration will initially launch at approximately 15 Walmart stores in Florida and Texas by the end of 2017. These cobranded sites will initially provide laboratory testing services and over time offers are expected to expand to include other basic healthcare services. In the future, these services will help us deliver on the fifth element of our growth strategy, which is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion in invigorate run-rate savings as we exit 2017. As we indicated at our Investor Day last fall, we also believe we will be able to generate additional savings beyond 2017. As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. We are e-enabling our processes behind the scenes as well as in our patient service centers. More than 600 patient services are now live with e-check-in. We plan to deliver this digital experience to over 1,000 patient service centers by the end of this year. At these locations, patients use a tablet to sign in for their appointment, and are provided with an estimated wait time. They know they are in the system and when they will be seen. So that's good for patients, it's good for us too. On the back end of this system, data provides us real-time insight into patients' flow, enabling us to direct phlebotomists to the locations where they are needed most. Since we introduced this service earlier this year, more than 7 million people have utilized this service to date. Finally, 2017 is our 50th anniversary of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We've had numerous events around the Company to mark the occasion, and our employees have enjoyed engaging with former leaders and learning more about our history. We are proud of our 50 year legacy and look forward to promoting a healthy world, building value, and creating an inspiring workplace over the next fifty years. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and he will take us through our financial performance in more detail. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.94 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 2.3%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 2.5% compared to the prior year, with approximately 40 basis points attributed to the PeaceHealth outreach acquisition which was completed in May. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.8% versus the prior year, of which 1.4% was organic. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 70 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds in the second quarter were less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate in 2017 and consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed between 100 to 200 basis points, which is consistent with the trends we've observed for several quarters. Reported operating income for the quarter was $319 million or 16.4% of revenues, compared to $422 million or 22.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a one-time gain related to the divestiture of our Focus Products business. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $343 million or 17.6% of revenues, compared to $324 million or 17% of revenues last year. Our Focus Diagnostics Products business contributed approximately $4 million of adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2016, which adversely impacted the growth in our operating income year-over-year by approximately 1% point. Excluding the impact to Focus Diagnostics, operating income grew approximately 7%. Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, flat with the prior year period. As noted previously, our second quarter 2016 results included a large one-time gain associated with the Focus divestiture. Adjusted EPS was $1.55, up 16% from $1.34 last year. The Company recorded after tax net charges totaling $11 million in the second quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring, integration and other one-time costs, partially offset by gain on the sale of an equity interest. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 48% in the prior year. The prior year tax rate was unusually high as a result of the Focus divestiture. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also driven by $13 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter of excess tax benefit associated with the stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year. The benefit was almost entirely related to the exercise of stocks options which is impossible to forecast. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, flat year-over-year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. For the first half of 2017, cash provided by operations was $490 million versus $464 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $107 million, compared to $104 million a year ago. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to remind you that we now have annualized all of our portfolio changes as part of our efforts to refocus the business on Diagnostic Information Services. Therefore, the quarterly year-over-year comparison will no longer refer to equivalent growth, but the year-to-date comparisons will refer to equivalent growth for the remainder of 2017. With that said, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be between $7.69 billion and $7.74 billion, an increase of 2.3% to 3.1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2.6% to 3.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.90 and $5 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.72. Cash provided by operations is now expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. And finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Our increased revenue, EPS, and cash from operations outlook is based on first half performance and reflects the completion of two previously announced acquisitions, including the PeaceHealth outreach deal in May as well as the Med Fusion and Clear Point labs which closed last week. In addition to our first half performance, our raised EPS outlook reflects the higher than expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Based on our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook and are well positioned to meet our expectations. So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Amanda Murphy: I had few questions on the volume side if I may, so I know that you have said in the past in terms of organic volume growth that you're not going to kind of parse out the specific drivers, but I was just curious as we've seen some weakness in pharma scripts and whatnot, so what are you guys seeing just in terms of basic utilization patterns at this point if you think about per capita usage if you will at this point?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: First of all, as we said in the past, we look at a lot of different external measures. Then we do an internal measure where we look at our same account measurement where we do a measurement where we know we have a good account and we look at year-on-year comparison of volumes. And what we've said in the past remains this quarter, we think the underlying volume in the market is stable, is the best way to summarize it. And then to your second point about volume in the quarter, as you know we don't guide on volumes, we do guide on revenues and it's important that we continue to drive revenue growth, it's what we are entirely focused on. So I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little bit of color around what's in the mix. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: So Amanda, as Steve said, I think we test in our imperfect fashion through the tools we have but the market is pretty stable. We haven't seen significant utilization declines and we certainly have not seem anything significant in terms of [indiscernible]. So, we are pleased with our volume, our advanced diagnostics, as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. Certainly volumes, and importantly revenues, wer4e up strong, our general diagnostics was solid, and then certainly POS is giving us some lift.
Amanda Murphy: And then I thought I could follow up actually on the POS side, so maybe a bit early to ask this, but you talked about the opportunity potentially to leverage from the POS agreement to sort of expand the relationship beyond that and maybe some reference work and things like that, so wondering if you have any insights there again, recognizing maybe a bit early, but…?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I appreciate that. As we've talked about and raised the case, when we engage with a healthcare system integrated delivery network, we talk about three things. First of all, what we can do to help them with their in-patient laboratory, and that's what we refer to as professional laboratory services engagement. The second part of this is the inside diagnostics that I referenced, testing, and we believe we could be very effective provider of more and also help them with what they do, so a significant part of the discussion. And then the third case is that we are in that discussion to decide what their strategy is from hospital outreach, and [indiscernible] is a good example of that where we bought their operating [indiscernible], we're helping them with 11 of their hospital in-patient laboratories. And to your specific question, in that relationship we are also helping them with the reference work as well. So, in all these engagements, we typically become a stronger presence in that account for reference work.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ellich: Just wanted to kind of follow up on the hospital outreach comments, you guys announced a number of good deals. The one that is more interesting to me is the [indiscernible] has gotten wide. I think you are in 12 hospitals now with kind of partially due to the U.S. [Oncology's] announcements. What potential to expand that since they are still big down in Texas and do you see additional sales in any of those markets?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks for asking. We are quite excited about it as well. There are a lot of different reasons. That goes down there last week, we had our date one [indiscernible] with a town hall meeting and spent some time with the management team. So this acquisition actually kicks four elements of our accelerated growth strategy. First of all, obviously it's part of our growth through acquisition, so that's good news. Second is in terms of innovation, it brings to us a nice [indiscernible] up our portfolio around what we could do around oncology and precision medicine, so we are encouraged about that. Third is to your point, it brought it to present in the second largest state in the country, Texas, where we already have a strong presence. And then with this, it's all about providing better health care at better cost levels, and we think with some of the work they've done in the engagement for instance with U.S. Oncology, we can help with the data and understanding what we would do to form better cancer care, so four elements of our strategy. So we are encouraged by that. And the relationship in Texas is strong, and so we are deeply engaged how we continue on what they built with that engagement and continue to grow from that given our broader presence now with us at Quest Diagnostics. So we're excited about it and we think it's a great acquisition as well. So thanks for the question.
Kevin Ellich: Great. And then just a follow-up on Walmart, I might have missed some of the commentary, Steve, but what measures or metrics will you be looking at to [indiscernible] how quickly you want to expand and what other [indiscernible] clients do you guys plan to add as I think it's going to be more toward the more [indiscernible] patient service centers [indiscernible] in the Walmart stores?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Absolutely. So first of all , we study with two of the largest states, Texas and Florida. We also have a strong presence in Florida, so two nice states, second and third largest state now in the country for us to make progress in the large states. Yes, we will look at some of their sectors for our patient service centers, but as importantly, what I said in my introductory remarks is, we are actually going to use this strong metric to provide some of the basic healthcare services that help with what we could do with population [indiscernible] to cost curve. So what are some of those things? Now can we help with people dealing with hypertension and do blood pressure checks, can we make sure that people are staying out their [indiscernible] beyond a diuretic suffering, congested heart failure, that we help you with that by periodically taking your weight, making sure you stay in your diuretic staying range. We can also help with diabetes management. We're also working with some of the healthcare insurance companies where we could close gaps in care to help them with their quality scores so they get reimbursed by the healthcare that we all know is the best healthcare. So those are the basic healthcare services, and fortunately at Quest, we have the world's largest laboratory, so we'll be, absent for the last five years, we are in the field of diagnostic information services. We have over 20,000 health care workers, 10,000 [indiscernible] with 10,000 other health care workers that provide services already for wellness services from Florida that help insurance companies. We are also providing health checks for life insurance pre-qualification physicals and checks. So, we are leveraging those resources and its relationship as well. So, we are excited about it. We think it's a great opportunity for us to just expand our already unsurpassed access to the marketplace, but also engage with the ecosystem healthcare with some of these basic customer services that can in our mind really help them to cost curve for healthcare in populations that are difficult to get access to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMC. Your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: I just had a follow-up question on your comments on PAMA. As far as timing goes, when would we learn that they have decided to postpone this as an incremental data on the hospital outreach?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So the current schedule as you know, we submitted the data already. That was delayed by two months because their portal was not available and so we recognized they'd listen to us and postpone it. We have put it in our data. Those people that are submitting the data have done that by the end of May. The current schedule thereon is to publish tentative rates in September, so the schedule that they currently have published. However, we have shared with them that we believe that several things are going on with the data they had collected. One is they haven't included all the data from those laboratories that they are buying from, typically hospital outreach. We believe their approach still limits the size of the sample, and we shared that. And also this has been reinforced by the officer and Inspector General that [indiscernible] that only 5% of the laboratories are being asked to submit data will submit data, which is about 69% of what they actually buy from. The second is what we have heard from some of the smaller laboratory association that affect some of the data input. So we have shared this with them because some of the smaller laboratories did not have good access to retrospective data. And while our concern is that they use that data for the basis of publishing at tentative [indiscernible] fee schedule in the fall, it won't be right. So our strong recommendation to them, and we have got word from Congress broadly, many different leaders of Congress as well as the center [indiscernible], we believe the best thing for us all is to take some time to get it right. So our recommendation is to postpone it. We have made a recommendation of how we believe they could collect the data. That will take some time. We think if they work in that aggressively, they possibly could publish the due clinical and fee schedule no earlier than July of 2018. So that's the path we are on, but the current schedule we have is that they are going to extend the schedule to get out some rates in the fall with the refresh clinical and fee schedule in the first of next year, and as we said in our introductory remarks, we are prepared for that but working hard because we believe it does not reflect the impression or intent to get a full sampling of the marketplace and get that data in a good form and get good quality data to establish a rate for itself. So we are pushing that in a big way across the trade association.
Mark J. Guinan: I think the key is there still remains a lot of uncertainty around PAMA. I'm sure you drew that from Steve's comments. And fortunately, we don't have the data to determine what the projected outcome will be, whether it's the timing or the impact. I do think it's good to go back to the final rule periodically and just remind everybody that the methodology is that CPT code by CPT code calculation, and so weighted median based on the data that they have collected compared to the rates that they are currently paying, and that any CPT code can be cut as much as 10% per year for the first three years and then beyond that for 2021 to 2023 the final rule dictates that any CPT code could be changed by as much as 15%. So that is the final rule in terms of the application of the rule and the outcome. I'm sure as you drew, there's still a lot to be answered.
Operator: Our next question comes from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open.
Donald Hooker: Just kind of a broader question on the POS deals, which seemed to have great momentum over the past year or so, I understand they are all structured differently. I guess on the one hand you have the full service outsourcing where you takeover all the employees and supervisors, and then on the other hand I guess it's just maybe one or two people one side and they are buying off your contracts. How do the deals break across that continuum and maybe can you talk about the different revenue that generates across that continuum for these deals and is there evidence that maybe over time as you add more and more of these that people start on the low end and kind of move up towards the higher end, if you will?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: We continue to be excited about the prospect here. And again, to start at the highest level of possible systems, and I have shared in the past their lab strategies are on the shortlist of strategic things they are talking about. And so they welcome meetings with us to help them think through this. And in that context, a big part of this is how we can help them become more efficient with their hospital in-patient laboratory, and it is that spectrum. The broadest capability is we help them manage it, the leverage of our procurement. They also learn from our best practices of running the world's largest laboratory. And to answer your question about across that spectrum, where is that set, I would say it's equally distributed across the lowest level of involvement, the most no predominant necessarily of one end of that spectrum. But to your last question, once we get in the account and we begin to develop the relationship, we do see increased levels of engagement by the customer with us and we do broaden our services broadly and we do spend more time on what we'd do to help with them their reference work, and then also in that context, we do continue the conversation about their outreach strategy if they are in the outreach business. So, the way we see it is we start with an engagement but that's just the beginning of engagement. And then we also use this as a discussion broadly of what we could do for them in terms of what their mission is and their strategy, which gets us into discussion about population health and what we could do in data analytics. We've got a lot of capabilities there, we have talked about that in the past, we've seen a nice value-added. These new extended care services are of great interest, particularly those integrated delivery system, that are taking on risk [indiscernible] they are quite interested and probably can leverage these access points for putting in place with our two [indiscernible] with Walmart is one example. So, this strategy is really a strategy of how we serve possible systems in a bigger way, and one aspect of what we could do with them is around their professional answers is engagement in their in-patient laboratory, but it's much broader than that.
Mark J. Guinan: And I would just add, Don, you asked about the revenues and as you implied, directionally, the deeper the relationship, the higher the revenues before actually on-site running their in-hospital laboratory and having those employees work less than we have to build that out for them. So that would be a higher revenue type arrangement. But I'm sure as you can imagine, there's not a lot of margin in that stop. So a greater part of the margin is really driven around rationalized and test menu, moving a subset of that off-site where we can drive not only better costs but shorter cycle time because we are running those tests every day. That's one of the [indiscernible] when we have a POS type arrangement, it's not just about cost, and that's where preponderance of the revenue and the margin comes. It's really just driven by I'd say hospital preference. As you have heard Steve say in the past, we have seen one hospital, lab strategy we have seen one. It's really nothing endemic to the particular hospital structure that dictates the POS arrangements. It's really just our comfort level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brian Tanquilut: Congratulations. Steve, when you first came on board, you guys first started the hospital strategy and that was sort of new for the industry and now you're doing the retail strategy with Safeway and Walmart. So, do you think this is the wave of the future in terms of where the lab will be and what do you think, as you look down your pipeline in terms of other retailers or other opportunities to get closer to the end user or the consumer, I mean how should we be thinking about the future strategy as you pull from your traditional [indiscernible] into more retailer or consumer-oriented settings?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Now what we talked about five years ago just for the world's largest laboratory, but the business that we want to focus on is Diagnostic Information Services. And so, the information and the services portion of our portfolio is the big portion of what we've really put our shoulder into over the last several years, and you are seeing some of the contributions in the way of business in the last few years. So let me just walk through what that means and where do we see this going. So in that strategy, we believe that hospital systems were becoming stronger. We knew that hospitals were acquiring physician practices. And therefore it was quite important for us rather than thinking about the hospitals as primarily a competitor, we thought [indiscernible] partner with them with their lab strategy, and that has worked well. They are all over trying to become more efficient. They are trying to understand how they can provide better patient care. And then finally, they are realizing that being in the outreach business is not necessarily something that they all want to focus on and therefore they can team up with us and we're a good provider of that. So it's a nice service [indiscernible]. And then as we get in, similar to what I said to Donald in the last question, it's all about their strategy and their strategy is to be a broader provider of integrated health services within a geography, and we could help them with that. So we have brought out a broad line of information products. We launched this a couple of years ago with the [indiscernible], we call it Quanum. And in that portfolio of products, we offer capabilities to take a look at your utilization for diagnostics, allows the data to be put on the table to ask questions about are we doing a proper work-up to make sure we have an informed decision that happens, that [indiscernible] what happens next in healthcare, which is an important part of delivering good health care at lower cost. Second is we also served up with a nice access to the workflow within the physicians workflow, the ability to look at all past data from our relationship with [indiscernible], and that data we think is valuable to get a full view of what happens to that patient. So those data analytic services I think are helpful. So that's the conversation we also get into. And as we work on this discussion, they are all interested in how they retain their current patients and grow the patient population as well as their membership, and we all see that there is a sea change happening where the consumer is much more engaged and that's why we think it's very important for us and we put a lot of energy on broadening and expanding our brand and what we believe our brand stands for. As a matter of fact, we have talked about our brand and our tagline being action from inside. Our vision is to have better health with diagnostic insight, not just [indiscernible]. So in that consumer strategy, which is part of our growth strategy, there's multiple aspects to that. One is the migrating access. So we believe our retail strategy helps us with that. We started with Safeway, we said we're going to do more, we recently announced our relationship with Walmart. So we think that's expanding our access. Second is to provide products that are consumer-oriented. We have talked in the past earnings call about what we're doing to be a provider of testing directly to consumers. We have launched a pilot, we're doing some of that in Arizona. We are now expanding that pilot of selling testing where states allow it to be done, to Missouri, to Colorado. We have a great business that's growing around wellness. We have a product coupled for wellness. We have expanded that to the field of sports where we have the sport diagnostic product. We have done the work with [indiscernible]. So there's a whole portfolio of more consumer-oriented products that we've rolled out as well. And then we have also improved on the access and consumers remarkably want to have all their health information, and frankly we're quite surprised by the pickup of our MyQuest application, I mentioned in my introductory remarks over 4 million of people have registered with us. We believe we are tracking to be on track to get above 5 million users. So, if you look at all those elements, we believe that this positions us nicely as that diagnostic information services company that's thought of when the consumer will have [indiscernible] the diagnostic testing, and over time we believe with better transparency, because we do offer we believe one of the strongest [indiscernible] proposition in the marketplace, the physician will ask the consumer which laboratory do you want to test and to go to and they will remember this great experience that they had at Quest Diagnostics. They will have information that's provided to them. They will have access to products and they will be able to easily access our capabilities, and so the choice will be given to us, and that's our strategy. We picked up the powerful element of our strategy and it's where healthcare is headed. Consumers will have more choice and consumers will direct more at healthcare. So we are making a lot of progress, we're excited about it and we think that's going to help us with our core business today but over time it will become a larger piece of our portfolio over time that we really do direct healthcare in a better way where it is needed, which is not necessarily only in hospitals but throughout the health care system and communities that are touched not by traditional healthcare but other places like our retail strategy. So that's where we are going with it.
Brian Tanquilut: I really appreciate that. Mark, just a quick follow-up, what are your assumptions and guidance for the back half in terms of tax rate and buybacks or capital deployment?
Mark J. Guinan: So in terms of capital deployment, it's really dependent on whether we have strategically appropriate deals that create value for our shareholders. So really that will depend on our deal pipeline and what might come to closure. In terms of your expectations for share buybacks, we talked about keeping our way, so pretty flat to the extent that we wouldn't execute more M&A. You've seen more share buybacks but I think you shouldn't consider pretty much flat share count. And certainly from a tax rate, as we mentioned it's impossible for me to predict option exercises. So outside of the stock base comp piece, you should expect the effective tax rate that's pretty much on the historical level that we've seen in the upper 30s as opposed to the rate we saw this quarter in the low 30s, really driven by the stock based comp. Now if we were to have significant exercises in the quarter, that obviously could depress it, but that's why we've been very intentional in calling out what that impact is year-over-year so that you can understand that it's really not operational.
Operator: Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Isaac Ro: Wanted to come back to PAMA for a minute, I appreciate your comments around the idea to caution process. I'm interested in the commercial side of it, in particular how you think the competitive landscape is going to evolve as we approach implementation, whether it's delayed or not? And specifically about sort of overall battle between the in-source labs within hospitals and sort of the commercial labs, is there a material tug of war starting to brew here between where a lot of that volume gets done, I'm interested in what's happening out there in the commercial and [indiscernible]?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Part of our discussion with these hospital systems were on their lab strategy, they see pressure on rates broadly. They are feeling pressure from their commercial insurance relationships, but they also are looking forward and realizing that the clinical and fee schedule will be refreshed. And as we talked about in the past, they have more exposure than we do to that. Roughly 12% of our revenues is a much more meaningful percentage of their laboratory revenues. So, when we engage in these conversations, one aspect of their consideration of what they are going to run [indiscernible] is they are going to be under pressure both on the commercial side as well as on Medicare. But the other aspect as you know is related to what their strategy is, do we want to put more capital and increasing more complicated area, and in some cases they decide not to. Second is they realize that our scale is significant and as we move away from a fee-for-service model to a much more value based reimbursement model, it's still longer to be in activity, it's going to be making sure we have the best cost per service unit and our cost structure is far superior than any other cost structure. So, in many of the cases we are engaged around this and in some cases where we have bought their [indiscernible] business, it's because they see reimbursement changing and they believe that they have to move to team up with someone like Quest that has a very efficient model delivering the necessary diagnostic services, so as part of that overall strategy for the integrated delivery system, a part of this is looking at pressure and range, but it's more comprehensive than that as well, Issac.
Isaac Ro: That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, if we look at sort of the rest of the commercial market, clearly the majority of your competitors are very, very small. How do you think they are going to react to PAMA over the next say 12 months, is there a meaningful opportunity there to consolidate more share from commercial labs?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so we shared this at our Investor Day. Look at the market we compete in, ourselves and the nearest competitor, less than 25% share. We have a very compelling value proposition where we offer some of the best pricing and we believe best service and quality on the planet, and we believe we should have more share. We're working hard at gaining that organically but we are also believing that we can consolidate more of this marketplace and that's why we have the strategy of 1% to 2% growth through those strategic [indiscernible] acquisitions. We have announced a number this year with [indiscernible], we're moving forward down with Med Fusion and also we also announced recently [indiscernible] in Massachusetts. So our march continues to drive that strategy. So we think the commercial rate pressure on the rest of the marketplace will help accelerate the strategy we are on and we should over time take up more share both organically and through acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
William Quirk: So I hate to keep coming back to PAMA but obviously it remains a pretty hot topic. I guess, Steve, certainly understand [indiscernible] position here, help us think about as we get closer to the initial implementation date, or the initial preliminary rate date, how do you handicap the likelihood of [indiscernible] at this point given all your conversations with folks up [indiscernible]?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I can't handicap it, but I will share that we are actively working the communication with CMS, and when I say we, it's the Board of Directors and all members of ACLA are actively talking to our Congress members both on House side as well as the Senate side. We have also met a couple of times with the leadership at CMS. The leadership at CMS understands this well, understands that the current approach has issues associated with it, and our simple messaging on this is take the time to get it right. We continue to support the idea of paying or having CMS pay market-based pricing. To get the right data, take the right approach to bringing on those rates is important for all of us. And what we remind them of is the reason why we have PAMA is reflective of the work that's to protect access to Medicare Act, and it's important for Congress and it's part of their congressional [intent] [ph] not to just pay at the lowest rates but to make sure that they pay for what they use, and the reason for this is there's many parts of this country that are not served by the large national laboratories. And the concern that they are now aware of is if in fact, if this is not done in the right way, rates could be cut, smaller labs that are very necessary in smaller rural areas, in some segment of the marketplace the majority of what the testing is has provided the Medicare marketplace could be substantially cut, and the example of that is what's happening in nursing homes where a majority of their single testing is basically the most routine tests that are done for many small laboratories all over this country. So we remind Congress and we remind CMS of where we started and why we believe paying market based price is quite important. So, what I'll share is we think they are very, very responsive to listening to our concerns. We realize there is an element of administration. They realize that what was put in place was put in place over the last couple of years. They realize there is an opportunity to work with us to get it right. So we remain hopeful but I can't handicap it.
William Quirk: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the pace of deals has increased and obviously you talked quite a bit about that here in the Q&A today. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much capacity both your deal and integration teams have?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: We have been at a point where we don't have the capacity to do deals that make sense and we spend a lot of time looking at deals, we say no to more deals than we say yes to. It's important. We continue to go back to our philosophy on doing acquisitions. They have to be strategically aligned and also we have to make money on those deals. And a key part of making money on those deals is making sure we have the right integration plan. And so, as we integrate this, we have a small structural team that helps us with the integration but also a large part of the integration happens in our regions as well. And so, if you look at the distribution of some of these deals, they have been distributed throughout the United States. We have done a number up in the north. [Indiscernible] being one example of that, Harvard Health Care being another example, but most recently we are doing this deal out in our western region with PeaceHealth and we are working on that with enough capacity to pull that off. So, our capacity has not been [indiscernible] at all. It's more the [indiscernible] factor to making sure we have deals that we believe are strategically aligned and we could make money on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ricky Goldwasser: The first one, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your relationship with Walmart, you talked about 50 stores by the end of the year, so how should we think about the revenue contribution and your earnings contribution between volume and price? And then does the relationship with Walmart preclude you from entering additional partnerships with others and do you think that over time will the market split in two verticals, you have the relationship with Safeway and Walmart and potentially others where your competitor has a relationship with Walgreens?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I appreciate that. First of all, the relationship is getting nowhere near. We said we are going to focus on two largest states, Florida and Texas, and we're going to pick 15 sites that will be our initial pilot sites. And what we'll provide at those sites are some of our patient service center capabilities like we've done with Safeway, but we believe there's more we could do on those sites with basic healthcare services. And what will specifically get done is really dependent upon where we forge relationships with healthcare insurance companies, their integrated delivery systems for ACOs within those geographies where we think there could be some value of providing with basic healthcare services in those great access points that Walmart has. This will be a joint venture. We are the majority holder of ownership in that joint venture. We have not provided visibility or guidance of how large this will be, but we are hopeful that this year we'll be off to a good start and we'll share more in due course as we get into it. The second part of your question, as we said when we announced Safeway, Safeway was an excellent relationship. We are proud of what we have done. We are half way into what fully we can realize, about 100 stores, we've got another 100 to go to get to 200. What we are doing with Walmart we think is complementary and every one of the retail strategies that are – retail companies that are in our space have a different strategy. So we continue to enjoy a nice good working relationship with [CBS] [ph] [indiscernible]. We believe Walgreens has a different strategy as well. And what we will do is – Walmart and what we will do with Safeway, we believe there are other ways we could work with other retailers that could be complementary to what we agree to do with these two that we have announced so far.
Mark J. Guinan: Just to add, Ricky, the impact this year is immaterial. I mean as you can imagine, it's 15 stores where we're really just going to be ramping up over the balance of the year. The value creation is well in front of us and it goes beyond just having a blood draw center. It's really those additional services that Steve talked about. So Walmart certainly has the foot traffic, millions of people every day. We have not only got the ability to do the laboratory testing, but as Steve mentioned earlier, we've got the on-call specialist and actually do a lot of in-home assessments, biometrics and things well beyond laboratory testing that can supplement our ability to provide additional services. So more to come on Walmart, it's not exclusive. We mentioned that the links with Safeway was not exclusive. There are many, many retail centers available. Even though we have over 2,000 patient service centers, approximately a little over half would kind of be candidates for retail outlook. So it wouldn't be all of our patient service centers, and so if you look at 1,000-plus potential patient service center opportunities, certainly between Safeway and Walmart and potentially somebody else, we are going to barely cover a small portion of their footprint. So this is not looking at blocking up and excluding other people, it's really just partnering and finding a way to get more efficient on our capital deployment and where we will [indiscernible] and other services.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay, thank you. And then one follow up just on your second-half guidance. So when we kind of like look at the contribution from acquisition, is it fair to say that second half acquisition will contribute around 100 basis points, and if so, it seems that you're looking for an acceleration in organic growth rate in the second half of the year, I mean based on our back of the envelope second half is over 3% top line growth, so are we in the ballpark and how do you think about where is the acceleration on the organic side is coming from?
Mark J. Guinan: So yes, Ricky, you are correct, the increase in guidance on the revenue side is almost exclusively from M&A. We're very pleased with our organic revenue performance for the first half. It's certainly not out of our original guidance range. So the increase in revenue guidance is really driven by the deals. As I mentioned on the earnings side, we actually strongly enough from the first half that there is some organic impetus in the increased guidance, and then the other piece is really around the stock-based comp reducing our effective tax rate in the first half. M&A, our new deals, is not expected to contribute anything meaningful on the EPS side in the back half of the year. So it's really driven by organic health and by this tax benefit. And then back to the question that was asked earlier about assumptions for the back half, right now that guidance assumes a tax rate that is more in the going-in rate in the high 30s. We shared that there was $0.06 of excess tax benefit last year. That was in our original assumptions and guidance for this year. Obviously we have exceeded that greatly in the first half but I am not counting on any extraordinary excess tax benefit from stock based comp in the back half. So should that happen and it's not really forecast, something we can forecast, then that could lower the tax rate.
Operator: The final question on today's conference comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Steven Valiquette: So most of my good questions have been asked already, but just curious on that retail strategy, what is the right number of partners over time just from a retail co-branding perspective and is that critical, is this a situation where you might be comfortable having 5 to 10 retail partners over time or do you want to keep the numbers smaller to maximize the co-branding awareness?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: We are working our way through that. The Safeway relationship is different than what we're going to do at Walmart and we already have working relationships with some other retailers. I mentioned CBS and Walgreens, different strategies, all these have different strategies. And frankly, I think we'd like to have a handful of strong national brands that we work with. We'd like to make some progress with those before we expand too broadly. So we have two now and working relationships with others. So, we are totally focused on executing against what we've said we would do with Safeway. We feel good about that. We just launched this new relationship with Walmart. We want to make sure we make progress in 2017. And as far as others, in due course we will talk about that as we work with them on their own trend, [indiscernible] how we could be helpful, but a good way of thinking about this, we started with one, we've now moved to two and a handful will be a good number that we could then manage over time to provide what we do and help them with their health strategy.
Steven Valiquette: Were you ever in deep discussions with Walgreens? You just mentioned Walgreens and CBS, but was that one kind of a tossup at the end and who would be the partner or is there still a possibility that you could still also partner with Walgreens in addition to the lab provider based in North Carolina?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So we are open to working with others. We want to make sure that what we do doesn't in any way contradict what we are doing with some other partners. But as you know, Walgreens continues to broaden their health presence. They have a working relationship as you know with Med Express. Med Express will provide healthcare services and that strategy will change over time. And as you know, most of these retailers work with all different brands, no matter what category and laboratory services are going to be different. So, they are selling all different bands in their stores, so therefore they are open to different brands and we believe that this strategy is good for us to think about how we could team up with different people in the ecosystem in healthcare and every one of these players has different strategy. So, we think there is an opportunity here as well.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Okay, so that concludes our day. We had a strong first half in 2017. We look forward to continue to meet our commitments by executing our two-point strategy, which is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We appreciate your time on this call and we hope you have a great day. Take care.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-20 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance. We began 2017 with a strong first quarter across the board drawing revenues, EPS, operating income, margins and operating cash flow. Here are some of the key highlights -- revenues were up approximately 2% on a reported basis and 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.16 increased 63% in 2016. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 18% to $1.33 which includes $0.11 of excess tax benefit associated with the employee stock-based compensation; more on this later from Mark. Cash from operations increased 28% to $196 million. Now before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I would like to briefly discuss PAMA. CMS postponed the deadline for labs to report private commercial payer pricing data under PAMA for 60 days until May 30. We fully support the decision. However, we continue to have some concerns about the current definition of applicable laboratory, which are those laboratories per quarter to report private commercial payer data. According to the office of Inspector General's analysis, the current definition of applicable laboratory would cover only 5% of laboratories, representing only 69% of Medicare payments for lab test in 2015. While we support reform of Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market-based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories. Now let's review progress we've made. As we detailed at our Investor Day at November, our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter empowered by continuing to expand relationships with hospital health systems. Our existing professional lab services relationships including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and most recently, Montefiore in New York City are performing better than expected and our pipeline for new relationships remains strong. So in the first quarter we announced the acquisition of an outreach operation of PeaceHealth Laboratories and expect to close in the second quarter. In addition after the close, we will execute a professional laboratory services agreement to manage 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest. We are hardening with health plans to improve the patient experience by improving price transparency which will also reduce bad debt. Our real-time payment determination which we begin piloting in early 2016 enables us to get patients an accurate picture of their financial responsibility or lab testing while those patients to pay at the point-of-care. We are currently live with Aetna, Highmark, UPMC, Florida Blue, and we expect to have more payers in place by the end of the year. The service benefits Quest and the entire healthcare systems; patients, providers and payers. Avis [ph] Diagnostics which generally includes our genetic and molecular based test grew in the quarter along with non-routine testing. Major drivers included neo-natal genetic carrier screening, prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and QuantiFERON TB testing. In the quarter we also announced the launch of the new test service that helps physicians evaluate the patient's response to the drug therapy used to treat infection with hepatitis B virus, HBV; this is the first test of its kind available in the United States. Physicians can use it to tailor more effective treatments for up to 2.2 million individuals infected with HBV. We're also making progress executing our strategy through provider-of-choice for consumers. In late January, we began providing genotyping for ancestor DNA, a service that today identifies and quantifies individual's ethnic origin based on results of DNA testing. We are pleased with the initial execution of this program and look forward to building on a relationship with ancestors. We continue to expand our relationship with SafeLink that are now operating at 65 stores. Consumer and employee satisfaction remain high and we are on-track to open a total of 200-patient service centers and Safeway stores by the end of 2017. We continue to drive operational excellence and remain on-track to deliver $1.3 billion of run rate savings as we exit 2017. Our revenue services partnership with Optum is on-track in helping us to drive down bad debt and denials. As we have often said, quality and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We continue at near Six Sigma levels of many areas and in the quarter of mid year-over-year gains and many quality measures including reduced patient service center wait times and approved test turnaround times. We expect our commitments to enable our processes will deliver results. We expect to cut paper acquisitions by 50% by the end of 2017. It will enable patients to check-in electronically at roughly half of our patient service centers by the end of the year. Additionally, we expect our lab systems to be 85% standardized by the end of the year. We received some meaningful recognition in the quarter, once again being named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine. Quest was one of only six companies in healthcare, pharmacy and other services industry and the only diagnostic information services company to attain most admired status. Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we are well-positioned to continue to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We have the right strategy and the right team to execute and create value for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark who will take us through our financial performance in detail. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on reported basis while equivalent revenues grew 3%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 3.2% compared to the prior year. Most of this growth was organic with approximately 90 basis points attributed to the 2016 acquisition of Clinical Laboratory Partners. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 3.5% versus the prior year, of which 2.6% was organic. The year-over-year impact of weather was negligible in the quarter. Revenue per requisition in the first quarter decreased by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds in the first quarter continue to be moderate in less than 100 basis points. We note that price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test and fair mix contributed more than 1% to revenue-per-req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $279 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $257 million or 13.8% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $297 million or 15.6% of revenues, compared to $281 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. Please keep in mind our focused diagnostics products business contribute approximately $8 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact to focused, adjusted operating income would have grown approximately 9% and adjusted operating margin would have increased 80 basis points year-over-year, consisting of 30 basis point of operating margin tied to focused in 50 basis point of adjusted operating margin growth. Reported EPS was $1.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.71 a year ago. The prior year a quarter included a charge of $30 million after tax or $0.21 per diluted share related to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted EPS was $1.33, up 18% from $1.13 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $11 million in the first quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring and integration cost. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 39% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of $16 million or $0.11 per share in excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.01 per share benefit last year. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, 20 basis points better year-over-year, but 80 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, bad debt expense rate typically increases sequentially in the first quarter due to the reset of payings in health insurance deductibles at the beginning of the year. As in the prior years, we expect the bad debt rate to improve gradually throughout the year. Note that the year-over-year compare was also negatively impacted by the fact that our products business had a lower associated bad debt rate. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $196 million versus $153 million last year. Recall the retirement of debt lowered our operating cash flow by approximately $47 million during the first quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $42 million, compared to $47 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenues unchanged to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.73 and $4.88 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.45 and $5.60. Cash provided by operations is also unchanged and remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the higher expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and was included in our previous guidance. Note that our original EPS guidance assumed a similar benefit in 2017 as we recognize in 2016 for the full year which was about $0.06. As you are well aware, our share price appreciated substantially in 2016, which yielded a significantly higher tax benefit in Q1 2017 based on equity vesting and auction exercises. Our updated reported and diluted EPS guidance for 2017 assumes another $0.03 of benefit over the remainder of the year. However, fluctuations on our shared price and auction exercise activity could add volatility to this figure. Going forward, we would expect to experience some level of excess benefit over the next several years. However, the time frame and absolute benefit is difficult to forecast given its dependence on our share price and the timing of option exercises. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we delivered strong growth across the board in the first quarter with gains and revenues margins, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow. Our agreement with PeaceHealth will further booster our growth later in the year and we are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and to drive operational excellence. I'd like to now open up for any questions you might have. Operator, please?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir.
Ross Muken: Good morning, gentlemen and congrats. Underlying organic volume, I know you called out a few other pieces, but certainly better than we would have suspected, even given that relatively to what we've seen in general on volumes across the market. So maybe could you help us understand how much some of those entities you called out sort of contributed to the strain versus sort of underlying market, and how you're thinking about the pacing for the remainder of the year given what's implied.
Stephen Rusckowski: You know, so thanks, Ross, certain I'll start and Mark will add to that. Sure, first of all we're off to a good start, we're pleased with our first quarter performance here. Yes, there's up a number of elements that contributed to the growth in the first quarter, we highlighted some of those in our script. First of all we do believe that will continue to get growth from our professional lab services work that we're doing. We saw some growth from that. Second is we continue to get nice growth from our advanced diagnostics portfolio and some of the more advance, what is typically referred to as esoteric testing that we do would call about some of those, and we've mentioned in the past the prescription drug monitoring and the work we're doing with the TV coiffure opportunities drive serious growth for us. We also got some nice growth through some other areas of the business, like our Wellness business, some or other -- some of our other services business. Across the board good balance growth consistent with our strategy that we had to focus at hospitals. That focus on our clinical franchises and bring new products to the marketplace to commercialize those better than we have in the past. And finally just good execution across the board. So let me turn over to Mark, to give some color round this and throughout the rest of the year.
Mark Guinan: Sure, thanks for the question, Ross. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we got about 90 basis points in volume and revenue from M&A, largely that was CLP, work lapping CLP at the end of the first quarter, so we no longer have in that a tail wind. Part of this pretty largely ramped up so that annualize in the first quarter as well. So those are behind us in terms of strong year-over-year drivers of growth. Now what we do have in front of us is continued ramp up of HCA, we are just in the early stages of Montefiore, and then obviously we announced Peacehealth which has an outreach element and also in professional laboratory services element that we expect to execute have not close that yet. When we give our original guidance 2% to 3% to the global in growth. The only M&A included in that was CLP because that been executed, and while we are very optimistic about the closing piece and there's the heat pipeline of other potential M&A opportunities. Given the fact that we got a pretty broad range of 100 basis points in the work, cautiously optimistic after the first quarter we didn't feel this point compelled to change our revenue guidance yet.
Ross Muken: Thanks, and maybe just a quick update on sort of how the Optum relationship that sort of progressing and any further thought, obviously a lot of market chatter or at least financial community chatter on sort of that relationship as a whole and just maybe talk about how you're thinking about obviously the longstanding relationship with the United.
Stephen Rusckowski: First of all it is going well, we announce it in the fourth quarter of last year. And a big component of it is what we're going round revenue cycle management and our billing operations and as a I said in our opening remarks it's going very well, we're pleased with that. Like you said this is a relationship so there is multiple areas beyond what we're doing around billing, we continue to build on that relationship and it's -- it's going well as well. We have a good relationship around our wellness business, we are their partner for wellness along with other -- other partners that we sell-through. Second is we continue to work with them on what we do with clients around data and population health and if you think about what we're doing with our professional laboratory services business, we're calling on the same people that are trying to become more efficient and better in delivering integrated delivery system and so that areas is promising as well; so often good start, doing what we said what we would do and the relationship will only get stronger overtime.
Ross Muken: Great, congrats again, guys.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. I was hoping you could comment further on the yield pipeline whether you're seeing any increased competition for yields of hospital outreach programs or otherwise, and whether you expect that the impact of PAMA timing whether that changes at all would impact the yield pipeline? Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you. First of all the pipeline as we said is the support of our long-term goal of 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions; we're hopeful about that going forward. As far as competition -- I would say the competition is stable versus what we've seen in the past. And finally is in regards to the PAMA, I think PAMA in general is changed that some would argue -- could look more catalyst in hospital outreached business as considered their strategy going forward. So when we engage with hospital systems run their lab strategy, many CEOs that are engaged with do understand that both the commercial rates as well as the clinical lab fees schedule rates will be under pressure. And this is one of the considerations that they think about as far as potentially selling their business or partnering with us in their business going forward. So if in fact there is some price pressure related to the refresh of the clinical fee reschedule that could be a further catalyst to accelerate some of this going forward but as you know, PAMA -- the data submission has been postponed by 60 days, we're still believing based on what they've told us so far that they are committed to trying to refresh the clinical lab fee scheduled by the beginning of '18 but we'll see on that. But there is another fact that we think is helping us with our discussions with hospital systems around their lab strategy.
Mark Guinan: So if I could just add two pieces of color to that Dan, one is that -- recall that when Medicare changes reimbursements we're equally impacted. So the buyer and seller are both equally impacted in terms of the value. If they get credit from commercial rates that doesn't matter to us, it doesn't change our evaluation because obviously we value it as our own commercial reimbursement. So while it might be more of a catalyst, it also reduces the value to both the buyer and the seller. And then in terms of competition, if you recall these outreach skills are largely cost synergy value creation opportunities, and so at any given outreach is likely to not be work the same to multiple competitors because it's highly dependent on where your laboratory is located, where your logistic routes are, where your patient services are currently located and there are geographical differences amongst any competitor who might be looking at purchasing an outreach. So in term -- there is always -- you know, larger opportunity likely to be a couple of parties at the table but it's not an auction because quite frankly, we're going to value them differently because it's based on that the infrastructure.
Dan Leonard: All of that color is very helpful, thank you. Just one clarification, so if the update of the clinical lab fee schedule were postponed to 2019; would the deal funnel soften or is it not that directly linked?
Stephen Rusckowski: It's not that directly linked. I think it's a fact out there that CMS is looking at refreshing -- we couldn't let fee schedule as we often talked and so we get all the data, we don't know what's going to happen with that, but it's just a fact out there that is going to be pressure on rates. And therefore hospital CEOs are thinking about their options for outreach.
Dan Leonard: Understood, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a very good quarter. I have two questions; the first one on PAMA. I'm just trying to understand the product from your perspective; one, is there anything that you need to do in order to be prepared if PAMA were to be implemented in January on 2018? So how that uncertainty impact you? And then on PAMA you talked about the applicable lab definition; where is that -- what's the status of these conversations and did you quantify the impact? If you [indiscernible] changed for you and should we assume that if this is something that's really kind of like in process that -- that were to happen the January 2018 start date seems unlikely?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, so thanks Ricky. Let me give you some color around PAMA, now first of all the data put in all the data has been pushed out for 60 days and yet, CMS still is holding to the goal of refreshing the clinical lab fee schedule by the beginning of 2018. Now with all that said, we just took two months of really tight schedule and the way this will work is they'll get all the data by the end of May - let's call it June. They have to work through that for four months in of which in those four months, two of those months are in the summer months and then publish their rates that they will look to comment on in the September timeframe. And then they'll publish upon the rates in the fourth quarter for that beginning of January 2018. So as you think through this, the two-month delay in data reporting clearly is putting pressure on the schedule and that's why people are saying, 'Okay even that they still have the goal, it's impossible that they can get there.' I'll share with you exactly what we're hearing, but there is more pressure on them to put that altogether. Now with all that said, as trade association, we continue to be actively engaged with CMS. When we're down there for our annual meeting of UCLA several weeks ago, we've met with CMS. This is many members of our industry. They're very, very responsive to us, they listen to our concerns about data. Part of the response to see would postpone of the data collection is because we are engaged with them and we're also having discussions with them and members of congress about the definition of applicable laboratory. In the way CMS is implementing the approach right now is excluding a fair percentage of outreach which is a large portion of this market. So there will be another meeting next week with CMS and this is at the highest level CMS with [indiscernible] to talk about two issues; one is the timeframe and second is applicable laboratory. And we hope to engage as we've done so far as a trade association of being constructive and helpful to get the market-based approach right, which is the intent of the congress with this bill. We continue to work it with them. You also need to understand that this also has the backdrop of them having a lot on their table in the number of positions across the board in HHS and CMS not being filled. We also know that they've got to work through a lot. I'm giving you some of the color, but we're actively working this trade association and we believe that by doing so, it's going to serve this industry well.
Mark Guinan: Rick, just to answer your specific question about is there anything we need to do to get ready, the answer is most of what we need to do is behind us. There is quite a bit of work to get the data together and we got it all together by the end of the first quarter when we needed to. Now, really what's in front of us is just once they publish the proposed rates, for us to take a look at it and obviously respond to that if appropriate and then as Steve mentioned, through our trade association, continue to push through what we think is appropriate, which is expanding the definition of an applicable lab. But there's not a lot of work per se between now and when everybody might decide to implement the new rates.
Stephen Rusckowski: And just to round this off, we also said in our Investor Day in the fall that if in fact it is implemented in 2018, given the size of this business for us, the effect it could have based upon some of the estimates that we're going to be able to absorb that, given the opportunities we have around operators [ph] going forward in normal course of running our business. That's our position. We believe it's already implied in our outlook that there could potentially be some reduction here, but we don't know for certain until we get all the data collected. But we're managing this proactively going forward and we'll see what happens.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. That is helpful. One other question just regarding the guidance, a question we received this morning. If you think about the guide, very nice leading the quarter and you had the text benefit, you raised by less than your feed. And I noted you said a little bit earlier in the year to change guidance, but is there anything that you see from operating lines, to the fact of the expense side that is making you wait for time being?
Mark Guinan: Well, Ricky, as I said earlier, it's just early in the year. We're cautiously optimistic, but its one quarter and obviously, we're optimistic, we're going to continue with strong performance. At this point, you're correct. The entire change in guidance reflected the excess tax benefit over and above what we have built into our original guidance. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Jack.
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Jack Meehan: I want to follow up on the volume side. Just even after you may call the adjustments around M&A and new business, leap day [ph], it appears there is a real step change in the first quarter for the underlying trend. Was there anything else worth flagging or the insourcing, outsourcing tug of war with hospitals? Have you seen any change just on that dynamic as well?
Mark Guinan: I don't think there's any step change in the environment. If anything, I think we've comment that utilization has improved directionally over a couple of quarters, so we are seeing some good signs in utilization. We've mentioned in the past that we monitor what we call our same source name account performance and certainly, we're seeing improvement in that over the last couple of quarters into the first quarter. These things can happen as well. We don't know whether that's a trend and it will continue, but in the first quarter, if there's anything I could point to outside of the things we talked about, certainly a lot of good deals we've done including things like Ancestry, et cetera are helping to drive some of that growth. I'd really say it's the utilization seem to be a little stronger than it was in the past year.
Stephen Rusckowski: And Jack, just to remind everyone, it's this the march we're on with growth. Back when we started with our strategy at 2012, we simply just restore growth and business that was shrinking organically. We have reduced that decline, we stabilized the business, we started to get some organic growth in '16 and our two strategy focus right now is number one, to accelerate growth. So what you see in Q1 is the continuation of that march of improvement and we believe a lot of the investments and capabilities and focus that we've put over the last several years is due to yield the results we expected. We're pleased with Q1. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, the results are a number of areas that led to the growth that you saw in Q1, but we believe we're off to a good start for the year.
Mark Guinan: And the only other thing I'd add is that the timing of Easter probably mitigated in some of the pack that we lost at the extra day from leap year last year, so it's hard to predict how much that's going to impact you because it's not consistent every single year, but definitely the calendar shift on the Easter into the second quarter certainly helped Q1.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then as my related follow up, one of your early scenes from earnings has been around payer mix, so I was wondering, have you seen any changes on the government side and just how that impacted the business in the quarter?
Stephen Rusckowski: Something notable, Mark?
Mark Guinan: No, there's nothing notable, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, sir. We will take our next question from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Amanda Murphy: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Amanda.
Amanda Murphy: Sorry. If I just snap one more on the volume side, just given all the comments because there's a lot of moving parts. But I just wanted to confirm. I thought one thing that PLS volumes, those would be done included in the 2.6% organic? Is that correct?
Stephen Rusckowski: That's correct.
Amanda Murphy: Okay. And then is there any way just thinking about all the different points you've made around PLS dynamic, Ancestry, et cetera, versus this basic underlying utilization? Can you quantify if you want those into two different buckets, sort of underlying utilization versus everything else in organic, what the impact was in the quarter from both of those sides?
Mark Guinan: Amanda, we've decided that we're not going to break out PLS every single quarter. What I did say at Investor Day was that I would expect over the three year period to 20 that we would get about 100 basis points of less from PLS would be our expectation. So we do have a deep pipeline. It's going to vary quarter-to-quarter, given the timing of deals and so on and so forth. We're not quite there yet, but we're building toward that, so we got some good solid growths from our new PLS businesses and over time, we're expecting a keg [ph] around 100 basis point lift, but we're not going to break it out every single quarter.
Amanda Murphy: Okay. So I'm going to count that as one. But thinking in one more, this -- just last slide, I guess I just had a question given your comments on the pipeline that you have and how strong it is? How you're thinking about forecasting or guidance this year? Just given PLS growth potential versus sort of the potential operating margin impact there, or is there a right way to think about the pipeline more like the 2018 benefit?
Mark Guinan: There are absolutely assumptions just like we would in winning accounts in our guidance for the year. We have to make some assumptions around how we're going to perform. So we've got a deep pipeline of PLS opportunities. Unlike anyone would, we do some sort of probability adjusting against that in terms of getting those complete, the timing and so on. So there's absolutely an element of PLS in that original 2% to 3% organic guidance that we gave on an equivalent basis and depending on how things progress, that's why we give a range. It could be slightly more or less than we assume, but we're confident enough to build in the guidance and then on M&A, just given the fact that that's a lot less in our control. We just thought the prudent thing would be not betting on the com and having any unexecuted M&A specifically in that guidance. Again, the way I would encourage you to think about PLS is like winning a new account, a new hospital system for our core business, something we go out. It may not be quite as co-competitive because there's only a handful of labs that could actually perform the PLS deal, because it really takes economies of scale to drive that savings and quite often, these are so complicated, it's not even more than one part negotiation. It's just us alone talking to a hospital system. In summary, yes, we have some assumptions around our pipeline getting executed this year in that organic growth and we're very confident just like we've done in the past about our ability to hit that.
Stephen Rusckowski: Just to make sure it's clear, PLS, it is a business. We're managing a portfolio of professional laboratory services accounts and like for any business, these accounts are different stages of the revolution. In that business, we have a number of accounts that have been with us for some time and like with any business, you're managing those accounts to make sure you have a referable account going forward. That's in our base as well. Second is we're growing new accounts, they're turning on. There might be some more opportunities to expand it into other hospitals so we've got growth within the install base as well with some growing accounts and then we're bringing on board some new accounts. So the highlights we've talked about at those new accounts, you put those three together and that has a business in its aggregate growing, but don't forget, we still have this install base of existing business that we could hear ourselves as well. We need to think about it as an existing business with managing accounts, growing accounts and then executing brand new accounts. But with all those three components, this is a growing business for us, it's a good business for us and it positions us nicely with integrated delivery systems.
Mark Guinan: Next question, operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. I'd like to first just ask about the revenue cycle; a couple of aspects of revenue cycle management and issues. You talked about in your prepared remarks an issue around some payers like Aetna for better price transparency and that might help collect a co-pays in deductibles upfront. Can you give us the read on what your experience has been there and then you mentioned Optum obviously, once you go there on the revenue cycle management. I'm understanding if the benefits on the revenue cycle management were probably going to take two or three years to realize. Is that true? But there was also a cost-savings initiative of transference of employees over to them. Is that fully reflected in the first quarter results?
Stephen Rusckowski: Let me start. First of all, the relationship with Optum for revenue cycle management has three components. First of all, we believe by working together with them, we can continue to become better and more efficient in our building operations and the efficiency associated with that, A.J. is part of our $1.3 billion bigger rate savings and efficiency goal that we have. So this is parts of many programs we have to drive efficiency. So a portion of our results and a portion of our achievement against that goal will include what we're doing here. Second is we believe by getting smarter with them around the interaction between class and patients and payers, we can go a better job of bad debt and denials and specifically, they will help us with what we talk about as far as real-time adjudication with patients that we've mentioned, four [ph] payers that are initially working with us on that, but we expect with Optum's help, we could get some more. And then finally, it's just completing the data set and their relationship with payers in general we think will be helpful of getting paid both from a standard perspective of bad debt, but also with the denials associated with more advanced diagnostics. Mark, anything you like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: A.J., as we've shared before, we signed a 10-year agreement with them to manage our revenue cycle management and we do have commitments for them on cost savings to run that operation and yes, that started in Q1, but it gets feathered in over the life of the contract. And then the second element is Optum helping us reduce denials and bad debt as Steve mentioned. Although we started the real-time adjudication prior to the relationship, Optum is helping us to drive that faster and more deeply and maybe we could have done on our own. We feel very good about what they're doing and I can tell you that early on, we've seen a reduction in patient bad debt in the areas where we roll this out. So we're feeling good about it, we're seeing what we would expect. It's still early because at this point, it's largely just the patients who are engaging our patients service centers. We're working on solutions that will be available in obviously the change managements plan to roll it out in the physician office where about 60% of our volume comes from. So today, it's really patient service centers moving in office phlebotomist and then eventually moving into the physician's office where ultimately we'll get the full benefit. But we're very encouraged and we're absolutely seeing a reduction in the rate of patient bad debt where we've rolled out this real time adjudication.
A.J. Rice: All right. And if I might ask you about one other initiative as my follow up. You said you're in 65 Safeway stores. Can you sort of update us, is this mostly having a benefit from the perspective of patients who are getting higher patient satisfaction? Are there other benefits to you and I know there has been on and off discussions with urgent care clinics, medic clinic type of entities. Is there any update about working with them for a similar type of program?
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, A.J. Safeway relationship, we believe is the beginning of our consumer initiative working with retailers in a bigger way and part of this is around providing better access. We believe we have unparalleled access in the market, we're 2,200 patient service centers, we have 2,800 phlebotomist and physicians' offices, about 6,000 access points, but we believe some of these retailers we could be working with and safely as one had better locations and there is anywhere from 15% to 20% of laboratory requisition orders that go unfulfilled. So we're helpful by having better access. We're going to get more fulfilled requisitions and that's going to help our growth and also help some share if we have better access. We hope when a patient has a choice and who ask the question, 'who do you like to go to?' for their laboratory testing, that the patient will remember a better experience in a more convenient location for that experience and they'll choose Quest based upon our movement here. That's both growth, but also as you would expect as we start to come on board with some of these centers, we rationalize our presence in a zip code and we might shut down some of our smaller patient service centers and saves us some money as well. It's both growth and efficiency. And we do continue to have relationships and we do continue to have pilots with some of the other players in this retail space. We continue to have UBS [ph] as the client and we're optimistic about other retailers as they continue to evolve their health strategy. They see it as a nice expansion from what they do today around pharmacy and also it helps these retailers for getting traffic into their stores as well. It's a multi-faceted program for us that directionally, we're very, very optimistic about and I think we're off to a great start.
Operator: We'll move next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Good morning. This is Alex Nolan [ph]. I got in for Bill today. I was just hoping if you could - good morning - when you're looking at deals for the future, I was wondering if you could just rank priorities. Between esoteric testing to gain access to different technology, looking at core testing labs to build geographic positions and then finally looking at hospital business partnerships. If you could just rank those three on what your priority is looking for doing a deal with one of those three in the future? That would be great.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. All that you mentioned are strategically in-lined with our direction. So we have for the last several years cleaned up our portfolio, we're entirely focused on diagnostic information services. Our first filter for any deal is does it fit into our scope of our strategy and from what you just mentioned all do. Second is we do believe that there's our growth strategies and we've outlined in the fall five areas that we're focused on for accelerating growth. One is related to partnering with hospital systems and so, the hospital average deal fits in that strategy as well. Second is to continue to invest in advance diagnostics and bringing new capabilities to the marketplace. So some of the potential acquisitions we could do there would fit there as well. As part of these priorities, what we have shared in the past is we continue to be very, very rigorous in making sure that if their strategically in-lined, that we have the thresholds we expect to make for our shareholders with any acquisition. I would say that's generally more of the cut we have is we're the strategic in-line where they fall out in terms of use of our cash and are they getting acceptable returns of invested capital, providing us with the growth we expect and at the same time, become accreted to earnings in a reasonable period of time. That's generally how we rack and stack acquisitions and it served us well so far. That fits into the strategy that we had or 1% to 2% growth of acquisitions. As you can see from our prior acquisitions over the past four or five years, do you see all those categories and it's more of a matter of when that come in and when we can execute it and less to deal with the sorting of what we'd like more of a priority than others. But we haven't had the problem having not enough cash to execute things. We think we should do strategically and also that we think has a good return for our shareholders. So Mark, anything you like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: No, I think you covered it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's very helpful and then just a quick follow up. Could you just remind us what the margin profile is of your hospital relationships and just comparing that to your core business? And then what's the opportunity to expand the margins in the hospital business? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Right. When you say hospital relationships, that's multi-faceted. I think it might be specifically time about special laboratory services where we're actually serving them for the work that is not explicitly billable. So it's the laboratory work they have to perform in order to get paid under the DRG for inpatient outpatient et cetera. Those margins as we've shared are lower than our core, but double-digits. That's as explicit as we've been and then in terms of our relationship and that word is really important, when we have our relationship with a hospital and we do professional laboratory services, we typically get most - if not all of the reference work. So we've talked about the fact that we do reference work for half the hospital in the country. That is the high end at more esoteric type work, but either they are not able to, or have made a rational decision not to perform given limited size and scale, so there's a handful of people that do their work. We have the largest reference work at any laboratory. So that's another part of our relationship with hospitals and then certainly the other part of the relationship is we've got other businesses that [indiscernible] hospitals their large employers, we've got our wellness business so we can help them keeping their population healthy. We've got some of our diagnostic tools that certainly can help them manage everything laboratory spend to benchmarking their clinical practice of utilization of diagnostic. So there's a lot involved in a relationship with a hospital, but specifically on the PLS, its double digits, but slightly lower than our core margin.
Stephen Rusckowski: Let me just underscore what Mark just said and remind you what we shared with you in the fall because it's important in our strategy in what we're doing every day. When we're talking about hospitals, it's about 60% of our market if we look at it and we have laid that out in three ways - one is what we could do to help them with their inpatient laboratory cost. These are cross centers that we could save the money. Number two, what Mark just went through as far as the reference testing, the advanced diagnostics to sell the hospital that they can't do themselves, they rely on laboratories like ourselves and then finally is outside of the hospital and some have outreach businesses, but they also are buying physicians and they're looking at serving geographic area and providing the laboratory services with those physicians that they now own or affiliate with. So when we have a discussion, it just was last week with a very large integrated delivery system, their lab strategy includes all three. We talk about our relationship with hospitals, yes it's the inpatient laboratory but it's a holistic view of how we approach the marketplace in a much more progressive holistic view as they build integrated delivery system. S it's all three components when we approach the systems and it's serving us well as you see in our good start of the year.
Mark Guinan: And in fact, that PeaceHealth is a perfect example.
Stephen Rusckowski: Exactly.
Mark Guinan: So as we engage with PeaceHealth, the decision was made to sign with us on PLS deal, they are selling us their outreach and then obviously we have a reference relationship with them as well. Next question, Operator?
Operator: We'll take our next question from Donald [ph] with Seabanc [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, I just have one question here. I'm really curious about this. I know it's new but this relationship with IBM. I realized it's new, but how that might play out on what you're seeing and experiencing with them around cognitive computing?
Mark Guinan: Yes, appreciate it. In our advanced diagnostics business, we have our oncology franchise and related to that, if you recall several years ago, we formed a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering where we put together a product that's called OncoVantage. It's going to take some of their content, some of the research with 34 actionable genes. OncoVantage essentially is a product that delivers on precision. That is [indiscernible] oncology. And what we also realized with Memorial Sloan that we needed a cognitive computing partner. So we at this fall announced now teaming up the two of us with IBM and this is for IBM Health Watson. They are our cognitive computing partner. So collectively now, the threesome is going at the market and the opportunity in front of us is about 70% of oncology here is in community healthcare centers, not in large urban centers like what Memorial Sloan will be serving. This is a big opportunity for us and we have our own dedicated sales force, it's backed up with a brand and the content from Memorial Sloan, but now when working with IBM, we believe that their sales force and their presence with integrated delivery systems and also just in general, public awareness of precision medicine in computing and healthcare is being helped by IBM. You might have seen some of the ads. They have been running and one of those specific ads that need to actually do highlight the work they're doing with us in Memorial Sloan in the field of cancer. So we think it's a step in the right direction and it's often running well.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. I didn't see that and I was just -- what would take a reasonable time frame to you at this relationship? How might it evolve? This is a year's process, I assume?
Stephen Rusckowski: We continue with all our partnerships, so this is the beginning. There's other things we could do with IBM. I'm not prepared to talk about that, but we believe all our partnerships start with something and they go from there.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Don. Operator, last question please?
Operator: Yes. Our final question will come from Steven Valiquette with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results. Thanks, good morning. Just a question around the PAMA cuts. My view is that if they are delayed beyond January of 2018, it would likely be in that positive request just because of this simple math of how it no longer potentially negatively impact the 2018 revenues. But as I'm talking with investors, I'm kind of surprised I keep getting this view by some that a PAMA cut delay could actually be a slight negative request and the thought pattern is that if the PAMA cuts themselves, we're to theoretically cause some lab provider competitors to either go out of business or want to exit the business, that would obviously help your volume gains and also help your M&A pipelines with PAMA cut delay would potentially delay these types of benefits. So I guess senses just keeps coming up in my discussions and just to have more of a full discussion around this with you guys, I mean how are you thinking about the net impact of the PAMA cut delay on your overall business for 2018?
Stephen Rusckowski: First of all, the refresh of the clinical lab fee schedule from PAMA -- I would just argue is a reality that's creating some catalyst on hospital systems; I must say all laboratories to consider their options going forward. And I would argue that as independent of whether any refresh takes place in 2018, 2019 or even 2020, it's just sitting there; that how they get paid for Medicare is being revisited and even though you've said that, its cuts is unclear on what the outcome will be until we gather all the data and we've talked about this before. Until we gather all the data, we don't have the visibility about the data, it's uncertain of what effect it would be. But we review that in general this review and the pressure that's on payment in general and we believe it's on the Medicare side with PAMA, but also on the commercial side is a good catalyst for us having these conversations with integrated delivery systems without the laboratories on the strategy going forward. So that's the first point I'd like to make. The second is the goal is still 2018; obviously if that's postponed or delayed, and if in fact you had a negative consequence associated with how we get paid, it would be helpful in 2018. But right now we're assuming that what they tell us is what they're going to do and therefore 2018 is what we're assuming and we'll see if that does happen.
Mark Guinan: So while the other element, Steve, is that if it's delayed because they expand the definition of applicable lab, we would assume that's probably a positive for the industry and certainly for us; and I can assure you that when I laid out the view from 2020 in terms of the 3% to 5% top line growth and mid to high single digit bottom line growth, I was building in some level of COGS on the clinical lab fee schedule into our revenue growth assumptions, but that was not building in some sort of a steep change in the competitive environment where we were picking up significant volume because people couldn't survive in a world where Medicare cuts were made. So I would be cautious about assuming that we're hoping that cuts happen as large as possible, as quickly as possible; we certainly would not -- be disappointed if things get delayed.
Steven Valiquette: It's helpful. Well, just real quick housekeeping type question; you mentioned the Easter planning and how that could have helped 1Q '17 just on a year-over-year comparison. And some people have asked, could it actually be a little bit of a volume headwind in 2Q '17? I'm thinking about those year-over-year comps; is that worth flagging or am I just spending too much time thinking about how it is?
Mark Guinan: Well, it's absolutely all other things equal going to be a volume headwind in Q2, just like it helps us a little bit in Q1. But you know, there is so many factor that go in, it's just one element of growth in the second quarter. But if you're looking at -- if there is something in the second quarter that would be a headwind, yes, the fact that Easter is in the second quarter is something to factor in.
Stephen Rusckowski: Okay, we appreciate all the questions. Thanks again for joining the call. As you heard, we had a strong quarter and we're off to a solid start in 2017. We're looking forward to meeting your commitments by our two-point strategy which is to accelerate growth and to continue to drive operational excellence. We appreciate your support and you have a great day.

Now, I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2017 guidance. We finish the year on a high node. We grew revenues, operating income, margins, and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders. While Mark will take you through the fourth quarter, here are some key highlights for the full year 2016. Revenues were up 30 basis points on a reported basis and grew 2.6% on the equivalent basis. EPS was down 7.4% on reported basis, but grew 8% on an adjusted basis. And cash from operations increased 30% to $1.1 billion. 2016 was the third consecutive year of progress in delivering on our commitments and creating shareholder value. Before I describe the progress we have made what I would like to do is to talk about a few dynamics impacting our industry. First, we are waiting to see what the new Congress administration decides to do with the Affordable Care Act. As we said in the past we never realize the full benefit from ACA that we expected, so we wouldn’t expect any significant near-term impact if it were to be use repealed. We hope that any potential alternative will be recognizes the value of diagnostic information services and healthcare. Second, as you know CMS has begun to execute a process to re-flash its clinical laboratory fee schedule under PAMA. We are preparing to submit pricing data to the CMS later this quarter. Now, having said that, we are working with our trade association to understand the impact on PAMA of our recent -- the recent pronouncements of Trump administration on regulatory review. Progress has also expressed its intent to act quickly on tax reform. We are closely monitoring developments and want to share the expected impact of potential changes. With the majority of our taxable income earned in the United States, we could benefit from any material reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. We would expect to use a portion of potential tax savings to invest in accelerating growth. Second, with little forward exposure in overseas cash, we are not likely to benefit significantly for changes in repatriation rules. Now, let's review progress made we have made. As I said before we grew revenues, operating income, margins and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders. As we detail on our Investor Day November, we are now laser focused on our two-point strategy, to accelerate growth and continue to drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter and park by expanding relationships with possible health systems. During the quarter we enter into another professional laboratory services agreement Montefiore Health System, a premier academic health system in the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Under the agreement Quest Diagnostics will provide laboratory services for Montefiore Health System to help enhance the quality and the value of diagnostic services to patients and doctors at the systems six hospitals. Quest is collaborating with an increasing number of hospital partners including leading academic institutions like Montefiore that are looking to focus on the core business while taking advantage of our expertise, innovation and scale to help implement their lab strategy. We continue to expand the work we do with other leading hospital systems including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and many others. Our pipeline for developing new relationships is also strong. In addition, our gene-based and esoteric testing grew mid-single digits in quarter and approximately 4% for the year. Major drivers include noninvasive prenatal testing, hepatitis C, prescription drug monitoring, and SureSwab. Also we strengthened our efforts to grow advanced diagnostics by adding a senior executive to our team. I'm very pleased that [indiscernible] has joined us for General Electric's Healthcare business to drive leadership in this important growth opportunity. We are also making great progress executing our strategy to be the provider of choice for consumers. At the end of 2016, we had already opened patient service centers in 56 Safeway supermarkets. Consumer satisfaction is high, and so is our employee satisfaction. We are track to open a total of 200 patient service centers in Safeway stores by the end of 2017. This improves the customer experience, while also helping us better manager our real estate cost. Also we are on track to start performing genetic testing for AncestryDNA in our Marlborough Massachusetts laboratory later this month. AncestryDNA recently reported it sold 1.4 million DNA test in the fourth quarter, and that's more than all they sold in 2015. And then finally, our emerging data and analytics business is gaining traction. We offer data diagnostics in partnership with Inovalon. The data diagnostics customer list is growing and includes premier health plan payors such as Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim. We're also proud that the independent panel of 50 industry analysts and influential journalists name the Data Diagnostics Service, the most innovative product of the year for healthcare. We continue to drive operational excellence. We ended the year with $1.1 billion in run rate cost savings through Invigorate initiatives as we projected at Investor Day. We are on track to deliver $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017. Our revenue services' partnership with Optum is off to a good start. The transition occurred in November and we expect to drive improvements in bad debt and denials in 2017 and beyond. In terms of capital deployment, during the quarter we increased the dividend 12.5% to $1.80 a share on an annual basis and repurchased $150 million of shares. In our December Board meeting we approved $1 billion increase of our share repurchase authority, leaving us with 1.4 billion remaining for future buybacks. We continue to expect to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from acquisitions and have an active M&A pipeline. Our 2017 guidance which Mark will discuss shortly reflects expectations for accelerated topline growth and is consistent with the earnings outlook we provided at our Investor Day in November. So now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and provide you with our 2017 outlook. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion were up 0.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 1.9%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2% compared to the prior year. Of this growth nearly 1% was organic. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.5% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed about 1% of volumes in the quarter. However, note that the impact of hurricane Matthew presented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points on organic growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue for requisition in the fourth quarter increased 40 basis points versus the prior year. As reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price changes, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headlands were slightly less than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 70 basis points for the full year. While unit price headlands moderated in the second half of 2016, we know that price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter. We continue to believe that in 2017 unit price headlands will be consistent with last few years at approximately 1%. As we highlighted throughout 2016 our PLS engagements such as RWJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. The strength of our PLS engagements in the fourth quarter continue to impact our revenue per requisition. Other mix elements including test and payor mix contributed more than 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $276 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $239 million or 12.9% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis operating income was $305 million or 16.4% of revenues compared to $288 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. The impact of our former products businesses in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $13 million or roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact operating margin would've grown by 130 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share was $1.9 in the quarter compared to $1.29 a year ago due to a one-time tax benefit in 2015 associated with winding down a subsidiary. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.31, up 10% from $1.19 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $18 million in the quarter, represented primarily restructuring and integration costs. The net impact of these items reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.13. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients have their health insurance deductible. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. Income tax expense recorded benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly a penny in Q4. Our DSOs were approximately 47 days flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was $1.1 billion versus $821 million last year, which was stronger than the guidance we provided in October due largely to better than expected earnings and improved cash collections. Capital expenditures during the year were $293 million compared to $263 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following outlook for 2017. Revenues to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.65 and $4.80 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.37 and $5.52; cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.1 billion; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. I would like to provide a few items to consider as you think about our 2017 guidance. First, as a reminder, we benefited from favorable weather and an extra day due to the leap year in the first quarter of 2016. This sets up a difficult compare in the first quarter of 2017. We therefore expect our earnings growth will not be proportional, with Q1 coming in lower than the balance of the year. Given this consensus EPS estimates for the first quarter are higher than our current expectations. Second, our revenue guidance of 2% to 3% equivalent growth includes some M&A primarily related to carryover from the CLP acquisition which closed at the end of February 2016. Finally, our CapEx guidance includes an outlay related to the previously announced headquarters move to Secaucus. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize, we continued our success in 2016 and ended the year on a high note. We are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Our 2017 guidance is both reasonable and achievable. Now, I'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes hi good morning.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning.
Ricky Goldwasser: I had some quick questions on the underlying assumptions for guidance. So, I think you're expecting 1% to 2% of topline growth from acquisitions. Can you give us some more detail on the price versus the volume? And whether you're assuming any buyback in guidance? I know that you have the authorization, but is it factored into the range you gave this morning?
Mark Guinan: Yes, sure Ricky, in terms of buybacks, the guidance is based on flat share count. So, there would be some buybacks necessary to prevent dilution based on our equity program for employees, but there's not any lift in EPS based on reduced share count in the guidance that I'm providing. In terms prices, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we're not giving specific number saying that 2017, we would expect some continued price erosion and we expect that apples-and-apples price erosion to be similar to the last couple years which was somewhere 100 basis points or less.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And--
Stephen Rusckowski: And again when we talk price erosion that's pure price freezing all other variable's one revenue per rent basis, we haven’t really provided specific guidance.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And I know you mentioned that you submitted the data to CMS this quarter on PAMA, any updates to your thoughts of how we should think of that PAMA impact and how kind of like the new cost-cutting -- or the updated cost-cutting program could help offset that?
Stephen Rusckowski: So, first of all, Ricky, we have not submitted the data yet, we're preparing to do that in the first quarter by PAMA. As you're aware we're all going to submit data in 2017 for the goal of CMS to refresh the clinical lab [ph] reschedule for 2018. But what I said our remarks is, as trade association was spending some time to talk about where are we with PAMA, what has to with administration said. How is Congress digesting that? How that might affect CMS? So, we're not prepared to say anything about that, but we wanted to call that that out in my prepared remarks. And we're considering others might -- where we're right now with the new administration might affect this Bill. Also as we've talked about in the past, about 12% of our revenues, we're well prepared to absorb that given our progress and you see continued progress would invigorate. We have now good line of sight to that $1.3 billion goal in 2017. We haven’t provided exact expectations beyond that. But at our Investor Day in the fall, we clearly showed that there's more opportunity beyond that $1.3 billion run rate, which gives us confidence if, in fact, there's some price reductions on the clinical IP schedule to absorb that in the new course of running our business.
Mark Guinan: So, Ricky, I'd take you back to the Investor Day, where I talked about through 2020 view that we could grow revenues 3% to 5% and grow earnings mid to high single-digits. So, that takes into account some level of anticipated potential price reductions as Steve said still to be finalize as we go throughout the year and then our invigorate program and our ability to offset certainly a portion of that and grow earnings faster than revenue.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And just one clarification on the 2017 pricing, to your point, you expect continued erosion in organic pricing, but when we think about the revenue per requisition as it flows through the P&L. Should we assume positive price increase based on mix?
Mark Guinan: So, again, I wouldn't call it price, I'd call it mix. But if you're looking for revenue per req, you've got two different drivers. So, as we mentioned we got 2% lift in Q4 from test mix and other mix elements separate from our PLS. So, there's no reason at this point to not believe that we will continue to get positive mix as we innovate, bring new test offerings that tend to have higher value. We also have shared that there has been a trend with higher density on requisitions, so we've been seeing an increasing number of tests per requisitions, while it's hard to predict there's no reason at this point to believe we shouldn’t continue to get some minor lift from that as well. But then the one headwind on mix, again as we've explained is our professional laboratory services growing at a faster rate than our overall business and because of the nature of that work, it happens to have a routine testing, fewer tests per req, and therefore, a lower revenue per req. So, how those all come out, we're not providing a specific revenue per req number, but the trends that you've seen, we're not expecting those to change.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you for the clarification.
Mark Guinan: Thanks Ricky.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jack Meehan: Hi.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hi Jack.
Jack Meehan: Good morning guys. I wanted to just get your outlook on the pathology business for 2017 just -- and whether you thought that could be moderate a little bit?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. Two sides of what we classify as anatomic pathology, one is on tissues, we would say that business is relatively stable for us. The second is with our path business, we've talked about in the past with the new guidance -- the new guidelines that were established number of years ago, we continue to see a decline in that business, albeit our -- the decline has slowed in 2016 and we expected that will continue in 2017. So, hopefully that's answering the question you asked.
Mark Guinan: And Jack just to add a little additional color, I'm sure you're familiar that there were some reductions in the physician fee schedule. So, in terms of our Medicare business for tissue that price headwind is built into our guidance and part of the 100 basis points or so that I mentioned. So, there were some reductions coming out of Washington.
Jack Meehan: Great. That's helpful. And then one more for you Mark, just you talked about the unit price expectations for 2017, just how do you think about the magnitude for PLS, the drag on revenue per req there, do you think that gets a little bit bigger in 2017 and how does the ancestry impact the optical numbers as well? Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, ancestry is not a business that we're going to include in our revenue per req because it’s a separate business. And we're not actually receiving requisitions; it's more of client services business. So, that's going to be separate from revenue per req we share. And I'm not in position to provide a specific number Jack. All I can say its included in the guidance, our best guess of what PLS impact will be and quite frankly, somewhat dependent on additional PLS agreements that we might sign throughout the year. So, it would be hard even to find -- wanted to give you that kind of color, to give you a specific number because the timing and our ability to close these deals with a certain timeframe obviously to be determined. But, again, I want to remind people that revenue per req is not a proxy for profitability and quite frankly, PLS is good profitable business regardless of its revenue per req being lower than our core business and some of the higher revenue per req businesses such as our tissue business are not necessarily the most profitable and some of our lower revenue per req business like Wellness are quite profitable even though the revenue per req is well within our overall enterprise.
Jack Meehan: That all makes sense. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning A.J.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello everybody. My first question I wanted to just ask about an update on the Optum relationship. I know the employee transition over to Optum from on your books was I think supposed to happen in November. Are we seeing now the cost benefit of that or is that still the common first to second quarter, and any update on the thinking about their ability to help you with your revenue cycle manage either bad debts or non-reimbursed test and the timing when you might see that side of the benefit?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah, thanks, A.J. Let me start. First of all, we did transition those employers over in November as you said. We are off to a good start. We are very pleased with how that has gone. We are actually very pleased on both sides that's Quest as well as Optum worked on the change management with their employees. The people that moved over are now employees of Optum that are very much part of the team of Quest. So we feel good about that. We are off to a good start. Now we did this just to reminder everyone because we believe by working with Optum we are going to have a better capability of working on our bad debt, our denials, our reimbursement and we think -- we still believe there is a lot of opportunity in front of us. So Mark, would you like to respond to the specifics of what we might see that.
Mark Guinan: Sure. So, A.J. as we mentioned previously there are several elements to this, the billing savings start this year in 2017, we do not benefitted at all last year. And it -- we have tenure contract and may build over the life of the contract. Then the other element which is, you know, the gain sharing agreement around bad debt and now obviously Optum is just starting that work. So we're fully expecting significant benefit from that, but it’s going to take a little time for the additional things that they heading to what we were already doing to accelerate the reduction in denials and accelerator our improvement in bad debt. So yet to come as well.
A.J. Rice: Okay. If I am just might follow-up ask you about I know you mentioned on Safeway that you have ramped that up nicely and I know you are having discussions with other people about similar arrangements, some potentially where the nurses either an urgent care or mini clinic type of environment could help you on the drawing the blood. Two aspects to the question, one is, now as you got more of the Safeway's done can you start to quantify on a regular basis what your real estate savings would be? And there any update on the discussions with the other parties about possibly collaborating with them on a similar basis?
Mark Guinan: Yeah, so in terms of quantifying the real estate savings, it's not something I'm going to do. It’s another element of our Invigorate program. We don't tease out all the various pieces within Invigorate. What I did do, A.J., if you recall at the Investor Day was a frame for your total expenditures for draws and broke down what portion of that, you know, were impacting with the stately agreement which is less than 20% when you look at the real estate costs and some of the other things such as cleaning and property taxes and utilities and so and so forth. I kind of frame for, you know, kind of order of magnitude in total. Our largest elements of draws is obviously the labor and there is labor arbitrage currently with the Safeway agreement. We're basically paying the same phlebotomist just to do those draws in a different location. So I'm not going to providing specifics around the real estate savings over time, but it's meaningful enough that, you know, it’s helping us, get greater confidence in delivering that on Invigorate savings that we talked about $1.3 billion by the end of this year and then additional room beyond the end of 2017.
Stephen Rusckowski: A.J., just to remind everyone that's this work with retailers is part of our strategy to accelerate growth. As I said in my remarks we are now laser focused on accelerating growth. And if you recall, you go back at the Investor Day we laid out our approach is to that one of which is to be the provider of choice for this industry. And we think what we're doing with Safeway is a good proof point of providing great -- a great experience for consumers in a different environment. The feedback has been very strong. When we talked about this at Investor Day there is a portion of requisitions or orders in this industry that go on fulfilled and we believe that having better access and very nice storefronts facilities like what we have with Safeway will benefits our business and benefit Safeway, benefits the patient by giving the testing done, they need to get done. So we see this is a growth platform for us not just a cash savings platform. And then finally is, as we have said at investor day, we continue to work with other potential retailers. Their health strategies, they are very focused on it. They see health as a major platform for their growth and then opportunity for them to get more traffic into their store. So more to come on that. But we are off to a good start. And again, it’s a key strategy for us around the consumer, there is other parts what we are doing around the consumer, Ancestry would be another example of that. What we are doing with MyQuest, a smart app and actually this year as we exited the year without even pushing it really hard. We have over 3.5 million registered users from MyQuest, getting access to the lab results. So a lot of different initiatives underway to build on this growth theme of Quest being the super choice in our space.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: Hi.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hi, Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, Mark, as we think about the cadence of the revenue growth throughout the year, I know you talked about 1% to 2% coming from acquisitions. Can you maybe just talk about the visibility around the acquisition? Should we be thinking that that will perhaps be more towards the back half of the year?
Mark Guinan: Right. So 1% to 2%, as you recall, is a CAGR over a period of time. It is not necessarily any given year when. I talked about guidance for 2017 we don't have any unexecuted acquisitions within that guidance. The only M&A within the current guidance is the carryover from the CLP outreach purchase that we closed last February. So I think that should answer your question. So any other M&A without the CLP executed and would not more loaded towards the back half of the year because the benefit of CLP carryover ends in the first quarter and I'm not counting on any unexecuted M&A in my current guidance.
Lisa Gill: Great. So that 1.7% to 2% growth included no incremental M&A, I just wanted to make I am 100% clear on that.
Mark Guinan: That's correct.
Lisa Gill: Okay. And then secondly, as we talk about the consumer aspect of the business and Safeway relationship, is there a way to quantify the number of reqs or the number of patients that you are seeing, I mean, just to get an idea of the growth going from 56 to 200 stores and the potential opportunity, I know it’s probably pretty small today, but is there metric around this business that you can give us as we start to think to about the growth?
Stephen Rusckowski: It’s interesting idea. And we will think about how and if we do that, because it is helpful to get some idea of how much flow we are getting. So we thank you for that idea.
Lisa Gill: Okay.
Mark Guinan: Lisa, I just want to make sure, look here, most of the volume that's being done in the Safeway was done previously in a patient service center. So it's not all incremental. It is a lower cost and we think a more consumer friendly environment, what Jim Davidson shared at the Investor Day was that the initial and it's early, the initial view was that we were seeing new patients, we're getting some incremental growth and it's hard to be precise and -- but as I pointed even a couple of basis points of difference in an industry that's growing 2% to 3%, we get to 1% to 2% left sound a lot, but all of the small things start to add up. So we said hey, it is really early, we are definitely seeing some incremental growth whether it's sustainable or not we don't know whether it will accelerate, we don't know; whether we will see it at every single site as we move from 50 some to 200 not sure. But we will certainly try our best to give you some color and give you a sense of quantifying that value beyond, you know, just directionally if we can. So as Steve said, appreciate the question and we will think about and see what we can do.
Stephen Rusckowski: As we keep on saying the initial results are encouraging. So, in due course we will share more.
Lisa Gill: Okay. Thanks. Great.
Stephen Rusckowski: Okay.
Lisa Gill: I am looking forward to it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hi, Dan.
Dan Leonard: Good morning. Thank you. So my first question, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that if there was any tax benefit from change in corporate tax rate, you would invest a portion of that, can you talk about you how much you will invest of any tax benefit and what some of the key areas are you would focused on?
Stephen Rusckowski: Well, first of all, it is all if. So, we are very careful to say it could or if. And we are not going to provide specifics of what we would possibly do, because it’s very hypothetical. But our two strategies that we're focused on is accelerating growth and driving operational excellence and if we get some benefit that we will consider the best way of concerning what we do with that gain. But we're not providing specific clarity beyond that.
Dan Leonard: Okay. And just a quick follow-up, but I may have missed it. Did you provide tax guidance for 2017?
Mark Guinan: No. We did not. At this point there's no reason to believe that our effective tax rate should be significantly from 2016 or the last couple of years.
Dan Leonard: Got it. Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Isaac.
Isaac Ro: Good morning, guys. Thank you. So question on PAMA, as the data collection process goes through and we also to figure out what it mean, I imagine that there will be a lot of smaller labs that are going to struggle with the economics. And I am curious if you have seen any signs of opportunity to take some share smaller facility, you know, because they are looking partner with you guys or they are just not as competitive and can't provide good service. I am just curious if that's something is tangible right now, and if at all, is there anything baked in into your guidance this year, at least to share.
Stephen Rusckowski: So, as you know, PAMA usage lands where the goal is which is for implementation in 2018. And if I gather the data and factors and price erosion against the clinical laboratory fee schedule, you know, the smaller laboratories that hospital outreach have a higher proportion of their revenues from the clinical laboratory fee schedule that we do, so they are much more exposed. So as we have talked about in the past we believe this is a good catalyst for Mark to continue to consolidate, and that's we still feel confident around that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. We demonstrated in the past four years we’re able to do that. We feel good about prospects or M&A funnel. And then also if you look at the competitiveness of our business going forward with this dynamic in place, I think it just speaks volumes than the opportunity we have in front of us, is a very strong player, they brings a lot of value to our industry, that's good start for years to come. Also as far as PAMA is concerned you probably a lot of seen Inspector General report that was published in the fall as trade association we continue to be concerned with the few facts there. First fact is that from what they have shared is small fraction of total laboratories they think will be gathered in the data collection about 5%. 5% the laboratories that are building in CMS now they represents about 69% of the total Medicare billings, but it is not -- close to 100% so this is not the intention of Congress. We're evaluating that as a trade association. And then second is, in that data I am assuming they make some assumptions around the gathering the data in hospitals knowing what they need to do around that provider number and whether there is an applicable lab or not. So the more data we get into CMS, the more representatives it is market-based pricing and that was always the full intent of Congress. So this is what I am referring to in my commentary that we're evaluating based upon what we heard from Inspector General, what we know is happening in Washington as we speak round reviews of the new regulation and we will decide in due course of what we need to do anything going forward as far as the position as a trade association.
Isaac Ro: Thank you. And then just a follow up on the higher tax question. I just want to make sure I understand conceptually if you guys were to get a tax break that the benefit of that would be deployed to reinvestment in the business to accelerate growth, is that sort of your prepared you are trying to say?
Mark Guinan: No. Not a portion of it. What we try do, Isaac, is -- we don’t want get out in front of ourselves because, although there's a lot of, you know, press about being a priority for Congress we yet to see when it is for sure and how. But there were a number of other healthcare companies recently that made some comments so we didn't want to be silent. And so in order to have people understand our thinking is as we mentioned any sort of statutory reduction since we earned basically all of our income in United States would be significant, obviously there could be other changes beyond the statutory production that could mitigate some of those savings. So we have to see that. And we just want people understand that we wouldn't necessarily crocked dollar for dollar to the bottom line that, you know, a significant reduction statutory rates when in fact give us an opportunity to look at as we balance short-term, long-term some opportunities potentially to invest. And if and when that happens we will give you more color. But we just wanted people to understand -- get ahead of themselves and do some math that we would necessarily drop every single dollar to the bottom line.
Isaac Ro: Okay. Understandable. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Thank you. I am going to ask one more question on tax because our analysis that we've done, it say, the statutory tax rate dropped from 35% just to 25%, that could imply a 14% increase in free cash flow. And that is such a big increase in free cash flow. So I know you don't want to give details on what the reinvestment would be, but would that actually change your strategy a little bit or I just feel like this is very significant. Would you look at the different business with that amount of more cash coming in?
Mark Guinan: So Ann, I wouldn’t say we change our strategy. As we mentioned is that as you said any sort of large statutory reduction would be significant for us. And therefore again as we balance short-term and long-term there could be a decision by us to take a portion of a portion of likely to be a small portion of the and invested in some longer term growth opportunities not a strategic shift, just really expanding some opportunities that maybe are just not making the cost right now because we have to balance short-term and long-term. So that was really all we're trying to imply not a strategic shift, but to your point if it did happen, it could be significant which is what I commented on in my prepared remarks.
Stephen Rusckowski: We are going to take a step back and think about the use of that installed windfall for now to get the best shareholder return. As you expect we would do.
Ann Hynes: Okay.
Stephen Rusckowski: It’s all very hypothetical, I don't want to speculate, but you can trust like we done in the past, we are going to carefully take the best use of any type of additional earnings to do the right thing to get a good return for our shareholders.
Mark Guinan: And, Ann, just to closeout we're going to stick to our capital employment synergy. So prior to my start back in our Investor Day in 2012 you have seen we inherent to that and this would not change our very disciplined approach to deploying our capital.
Ann Hynes: All right. Great. Can I ask about the UNH contract? I think -- and I could be wrong. I know LabCorp's in a long-term contract that ends in 2018. Do you expect -- since we're coming toward the end of that, do you expect that contract to come out to RFP? And if it does, do you expect maybe a potential opportunity, because I know that you have said in the past that you still process a lot of reqs for them out of network. So, how do you view that contract over the next couple of years?
Stephen Rusckowski: Our relationship with United Healthcare Group continues to get stronger. We are a big provider today, already laboratory services. We do have a number of areas where we actually do have carve out if you will, providing services on contract. We have not got specific on that, but we do. And our work without Optum, our revenue services, revenue cycle services this reinforces our relationship. I was asked the question when we did this in the fall, does this help you with United and my answer is it doesn't hurt you, since it’s very visible and we are clearly a strategic partner of United Healthcare Group. And then also we had mentioned that we are partnering around wellness. We are the partner for Optum as they provide wellness solutions to their client base and we're happy about that. And what I will share is that obviously we are trying to get the best possible access as possible with these many healthcare insurers in our portfolio. We are not a national provider for United today and we're hopeful as we go forward we get strong with United as they work through their contract considerations, so we are hopeful that we could be more of a provider than we are today, but we don't have any specifics share with you at this time.
Ann Hynes: Okay. Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Ann.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Bill Bonello: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question. There's some large properties I think up for sale and some that maybe should be. What is your appetite these days for larger scale acquisitions, but within the lab space? If things are presented, is that something that you would consider, or are you strictly focused on some of the more regional and hospital deals?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah, first of all, what we said we will continue to do going forward is what we said in 2012. Our business is diagnostic information services. Anything we do in terms of potential acquisition into scope, so everything as pretty strategically align. And the reason why we are so committed to it, we have cleaned up our portfolio to support that. Because we think substantial opportunities in that scope of our market. So with that we said there are a number of smaller acquisitions we can do which are in that 1% to 2%, but we also said over the years is that if something were to come to us that make strategic sense that we could build value creation case for our shareholders, we wouldn’t rule it out. But what I will again share is that we're not do an acquisitions that we cannot have the value creation. And that has been something that we have delivered against in our capital deployment strategy service well. So no matter big or small everything we do is going to create value for our shareholders.
Bill Bonello: Okay. That makes sense. And I don't know if you are even allowed to comment on this. But is there a bigger pipeline of bigger opportunities out there than maybe there has been in the past?
Mark Guinan: Bill, what I would say is there's always a pipeline and we had -- when you say when we consider we have looked at some larger opportunities in the past that obviously we haven't shared and for various reasons and some of it being what Steve talked about, we have passed. So we're always looking at best path for shareholder value creation and it doesn’t mean a large transaction could not be the best path. So we evaluate those things regularly. I wouldn't say that in today's world there is any more opportunities and sometimes you create opportunities by reaching out the people having a conversation so it's not as if we sit on the sideline to see if somebody's declaring that, you know, they are looking for some sort of transaction. So, we're very actively engaged with a number of people in the industry and geographically around the world. And we are considering capital deploying options all the time. And what comes back to as Steve said as we have some very hard fast M&A metrics and that is our kind of litmus test for evaluation and if we found a larger transaction that make strategic sense and met those metrics and we felt good about the chemistry and integration path, you know, we certainly would seriously consider that.
Bill Bonello: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: Good morning, guys. Hey, Steve, in the past you have talked about you gave a pricing outlook basically through 2017. And I know you are forecasting the 100 basis point decline this year. Where you sit today, take out PAMA, how are you thinking about pricing trends beyond this year?
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks for the question Brian. What I had mentioned is that, you know, through 2020 I would expect the pricing environment to continue to be similar to what has been in the last couple years, separate from PAMA and then if you also recall I did a slide kind of and if PAMA happens, you know, some of it -- especially at some of the lower end possibilities are kind of within the variability. As you look at this year we had about 50 basis points erosion in the back half, certainly higher than the first half, so if PAMA ends up contributing overall another 30, 40 basis points is almost within the variability of what we have seen, obviously if PAMA ends up being at high-end it would be a little more significant, but as you might expect we considered all of that in the guidance that we gave, this will be in the lookout that I gave and view in earnings growth relative to revenue through 2020.
Brian Tanquilut: I appreciate it. Mark, just a different question. Cash flow was pretty strong in Q4. As we think about capital deployment, you have said no incremental deals in the guide to buyback. Basically you just offset the dilution from the stock grants. So, is there anything -- number one, is there anything to call on the Q4 cash flow that drove that strategy? And then second, capital deployment for the incremental cash that you haven't baked into the guide being deployed, is that basically your upside driver for the rest of the year? How should we be thinking about that?
Mark Guinan: I want to make sure I am clear on the question Brian, so tell me if I am answering what you are asking. Cash flow was stronger than we anticipated this year. We did actually take that as an opportunity to accelerate a couple of capital investments into this year and our free cash flow still stronger than the guidance that I had provided, so we felt we did that responsibly. And that was some strategic decisions and try to accelerate some items that we're working on in our Invigorate program and so and so forth. Going into this year I am guiding to flat cash flow year-over-year. Obviously as you know there's various moving pieces, one time things that could impact positively, so net-net $1.1 million of operating cash flow, $250 million to $300 million of expected capital investment and then the rest of free cash flow, you know, half of that at least is going to be committed to our shareholders through our dividend which again we increased recently on by double-digits and then supplemented by some share buybacks. With the rest of free cash flow back to an earlier question I got it, it is dependent on executing M&A and it's not then we will buyback additional shares, so really that's to be determine.
Brian Tanquilut: Got it. That answers the question. Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Valiquette of Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Steven Valiquette: Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on the results. So I think just for us, just a quick high level volume question. I guess just to the extent that some in the investment community, let's say rightly or wrongly, try to gauge lab industry volume growth by looking at things like physician office visit data, hospital volume data, it seemed like most of these data points were suggesting that lab providers could see some accelerating growth in volumes in the fourth quarter. I just forgot where you guys stand on how much you also look at these external data points, but also your latest thoughts on how much you think investors should focus on this external data. Since you guys had decent volume growth in the quarter, don't get me wrong. But it didn't correlate to that expectation of accelerating growth and that some investors may have garnered from that external data. Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski: So, let me start with that. We look at it all, Steven. We look at all the different matrices and leading indicators. And what we've mentioned in the past we have an internal measure we will take a look at 1,000 accounts that we know they are accounts and we do seeing how look year on year, and say what's going on with the underlying utilization of patients that those physicians are seeing. And what we have said in the past and we will continue to say because we looked at this in the fourth quarter it's been relatively stable. So -- and this is really good representation of utilization for the market we think. So it's relatively stable. So prospectively that's what we provide in our guidance, but on top of that what you see is everything that's driving the marketplace that is more innovation coming into marketplace, more tests per encounter in the marketplace and aging populations, so that is giving us the growth that we are seeing, but also the market perspective growth that we anticipated as well. So that's what we see. Now I will remind you that in the fourth quarter we did have a hurricane event which affected us in Q4, got up in October, October 4 lot of the industry does have an impact on the business. So Mark, any other color you would like add to volumes in Q4, but also prospectively?
Mark Guinan: So, as Steve mentioned and I said in my prepared remarks we got about a 30 basis headwind by our calculation from hurricane Matthew, we do have a significant business in Florida and although really only northern Florida was hit because of the preparations there were a lot fewer office visits and a lot fewer lab draws in the state of Florida while Matthew was going on and then certainly it hit to the Carolina as well significantly and so we have some impact there. So that certainly dampened growth would've been otherwise and without getting into too math there is a difference in the calendar and we don't always talk about this, but weekends we do less business, weekdays we do more, so any given quarter, you know, depending on how many weekends there, weekdays versus the prior year there can be some impact as well. We don't into too much detail, but you can take a look at the calendar to see how Q4 compared to 2015 and see that there were fewer weeks.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is coming from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys. It seems like your main competitor is mimicking or getting closer in its strategy on the hospital to what you have been doing. Is that a positive relative to maybe getting more of those types of transition over the goal line just because you have two, maybe forces pushing there, or how do you think about it in general in your ability to execute against what's been sitting in the pipeline?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah, well, first of all, we have a strategy for years now focusing on what we believe supporting element of what's happening in healthcare in the U.S. that is hospitals of the big influence over laboratory strategy in general. We shared at our Investor Day it’s about 50% of the marketplace. If you look at all the laboratories that are part of inpatient acute care setting and to run those we can help them with those laboratories to make more efficient. And then second is there a big part of the non-hospitals of market were about roughly a third of the market is those hospital systems competing with us. So we three or four years ago -- this is core part of our strategy, back to 2012 we said it was one of our three focus areas. And so we've been investing. It is not something you can just put up a shingle and get it to the market easy. I remind you these three areas we work with hospitals on. One is providing the most sophisticated advanced testing sometimes called reference testing, we are the leader there. Second is we help them become more efficient with their inpatient hospital cost and the deal that we just announced today with Montefiore, is a good example, where they leverage on our efficiency and seems that money makes them more efficient, so they can focus on what they want to focus on is a system. And then finally is outreach. And in some cases we buy outreach businesses where we have an outright purchase. What we announced last year was the relationship of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut is an example of that. The best place for us to be is requesting side of the their lab strategy where we are helping them with reference work, we are helping them with our inpatient laboratory and where they are partner for outreach. Do, it’s all three. So we have been at this for a while, by being added we have invested in capabilities, repeatable methodologies, how do you price them, how do you call on the [indiscernible], what I will share is this is not typical laboratory sale it's not in a physician level, it is not at a lab director level, it’s typically with the CEO and CFO delivery system. This is strategic. And so many of these conversions are at the most senior level. So I think it is a big part of -- has been a big of our strategy for a long time. We're gathering momentum. As you can see with the deals we have announced. Last year we announced Barnabas, we announced HCA, we have yet another one in the first quarter. So we have shown that we are getting momentum and we have a strong pipeline. And as far as others participating in the marketplace I think that's reinforces, the interest in the marketplace. It is a big market, there is plenty of opportunities, there is thousands of hospitals. Do we think we are going to be the only competitor in the space? No. But I think it’s just another data point that this is a good strategy that we have been working on and there is a lot more interest out there than just what we have done in few deals. So it’s getting momentum in general in terms of integrated delivery systems, thinking about the lab strategy. So we are encouraged about the progress we have made and we are very, very optimistic about the future growth opportunities in that investment.
Ross Muken: That's helpful. And maybe, Mark, just quickly on Q1 you obviously gave a bit of color. Could you also just remind us on SG&A cadence? I remember, while you did have a bit of a step up, obviously in volume in Q1, you also had maybe a bit more of your SG&A for the year. Just any color you could provide on how that OpEx cadence may look for how to consider what happened last year.
Mark Guinan: Sure. Ross, typically we don’t give any guidance -- quarterly guidance or SG&A, but I can assure you that different from last year. You shouldn’t expect a, you know, quarterly differential. Last year we were building some key capabilities, around our data diagnostics and other things, investing upfront, as necessary ahead of some revenues, but I don’t anticipate anything significant similar this year.
Ross Muken: Thanks and congrats, guys.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hey, thanks.
Mark Guinan: Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: I think that was the last question and we thank all of you for joining the call. As we said at the beginning I'll close with this. We have strong quarter and a solid 2016. We're looking forward to accelerated growth and driving operational excellence this year in 2017. We thank you for all your support and you have great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. During the third quarter, revenues were up on reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equipment basis. Reported EPS decreased 43%, primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q Squared Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%, cash from operations were $301 million up 42%. Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of five-point strategy, which as you all know is to restore growth, drive operational excellence to simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So let's start with growth.. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for six Denver area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our Professional Lab Services agreement where RWJ Barnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford Healthcare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring in infectious disease testing including Zika. In prescription drug monitoring we remain and industry leader with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth generation HIV testing as well as Hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. Turning to Zika we complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories, selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response of the Zika emergency in the United States. Looking forward we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling Ancestry DNA subscribers to build their family based on the origins. Over time we intend to support additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health tree. We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM launch of genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest expertise in genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to have the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson power tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community and oncologist to provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. The next element of our strategy I'll highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help us reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of healthcare cost for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement without Optum as the start of a long-term relationship and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent the United Health Group. For decades Quest has served the United Healthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in five states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy was to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostic business. Through this ASR we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases of 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations webpage. Now Mark will provide an overview on our third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook, Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth including our Professional Lab Services or PLS engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price and includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis points headwinds we observed in the first half. Consistent with previous quarters our PLS engagement such as our WJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, the impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements including test and payer mix contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2016 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to Q Squared joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was a $1.34 in the quarter, compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q Squared contribution mentioned previously. Adjusted EPS was $1.37 up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restricting and immigration charges. The net impact of these items benefitted our reported EPS by $0.07.  Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum, to reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support cost during each year of the 10-year agreement and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of dilutive securities which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. Our DSOs were 46 days, two days higher than last year, but one day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. For the first nine months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter compared to $169 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items, which will impact our full-year operating cash flows. The first relates to after-tax charges for the full-year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the focus to register that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3 with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate these three items are adversely impacting our full-year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. Now turning to guidance, based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows. Revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. And finally capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. To summarize we continued our success in 2016 with another good performance in the third quarter. We continue to generate strong cash from operations and we remain on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. With that, we would be happy to take any questions, operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Bill Quirk: Thanks and good morning, everyone. First question is just thinking about the, final clinical lab fee schedule for 2017, I guess we've been thinking or expecting rather that it was likely to be flat when the final adjustment comes out here in about lesser month now, but recent hearing some chatter that we may actually see a small inflation update to that. Any thoughts on that guys? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes thanks. So as you know we don't really know and last year we had a small adjustment as well to it. So hopefully your view of what you've heard is right, but at this point we have nothing to add to what you're saying.
Bill Quirk: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up, I guess kind of bigger picture question, help us think a little bit about some of the health exchanges. Obviously there has been some pressure on managed care. We've seen some people pull out of this and so how are you thinking about this over the coming couple of years here, thanks?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah I think we're all trying to understand how those lives will eventually get healthcare insurance. I think state by state will sort its way out. We can't speculate at this time how those lives will be picked up but as you read and you know as well as we do, that the number of the particularly national providers have decided to pull out of the exchanges, but you would -- you have to believe that those lives that might be impacted will be dealt within the appropriate way state-by-state, but it's too early to speculate on that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ashley Craig: Hi. Good morning. This is Ashley on for Ricky. I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color into some of the partnerships you highlighted in the press release. We noted that PLS agreements are positive to volumes, the headwind to price, the Optum agreement is supposed to help with curving bad debt expense, but could you talk a little bit about Safeway and Ancestry and IBM? Where are we with the impact of those relative to the core business?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah. Thank you very much. Well first of all, we're encouraged with our continued growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted two in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA, the second is related to a relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're often running -- they contributed to growth in the quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects and also we've a good funnel with us. They made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we described how this business affects the calculation of revenue per acquisition and what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script and I am sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact of this quarter to our performance and that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there is other characteristics of our business like and peer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects for professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. The report is greater for shareholder value creation, but it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear sure and I am sure what I've done here Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in healthcare is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating. We know how to do that. Number of things we talked about already have to do with us former relationships. We talk about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to is the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought. We're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in healthcare analytics, leaders in healthcare services to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think of them working with us is better than us working independent and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity, but also what you also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with the United Health Group and this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration to do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services and then finally as we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory professional services for United Healthcare membership today and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's a growing new field to Precision Medicine as you know and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to oncologists what can be known with 34 actionable jeans. From that data we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will now work, but as importantly what clinical trials that could potentially roll their patience in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again and the broad Institute is involved as well which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, healthcare is really a much more collaborative game going forward and quest we're all about working with others when it comes quite clear of the work we've done and is how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there and let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly addressed the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation, Mark.
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. I think it's important we clearly have not done enough to get everybody clear on this. When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume, but in fact we do test. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and would say a standard routine test and another patient comes forward and has two of those, there is going to be a different value to the requisition, but it has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have and we have shared requisitions is there is a margin implication to some extent because of the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing you say the more testing we can get on our requisition, the more efficient you can be, but again that's on the cost side not the price side. However with PLS as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws and from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to at an office position park. So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost and then the billing is incredibly efficient because there is no third party billing, there is no patient responsibility of the single bill for a large volume to client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do that people are clear that the mix calculation is the calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so to understand apples and apples are headwinds and we're actually getting paid less per test.
Ashley Craig: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you for the color.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you..
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citibank. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Good morning. So just going back to the PLS, I just hope and I guess on the two fronts, on volume and price, first on the volume side, just hoping whether you could give a little bit of sense of what it may be contributed specifically HealthONE and Barnabas to volume growth this quarter and maybe help us is it in the run rate at this point. Is there some sort of ramp we should consider in the fourth quarter and in 2017 any help there. And then just on the pricing side as you just explained, I guess I guess what I'm still grappling with is just understanding so on a test by test basis, is the price the same or is it lower in PLS right, because I would think you'd have more tests per acquisition on the hospital test than you would and the normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and effects lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So thanks for the questions. There were a couple there Ralph. Let me try to address them all. First off Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate and BTA is a relationship that we said is ramping up. I mentioned that half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS and we don't call out specific relationships. So we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are hearing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test for req for PLS actually tend to be fewer not greater. When you imagine something ongoing in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests and your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as in-patient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And then finally on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business, it's a negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it a way that we can save them money, and we can make a margin ourselves. So, it is different pricing, but not necessarily lower or higher, because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given tasks depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated, but in general, fewer tests per req we have definitely future momentum, we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA and so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future.
Shawn Bevec: Ralph, this is Shawn. Just one point of clarification, half of our volume was organic of what some of that was PLS.
Ralph Giacobbe: Okay. Very helpful and then just one more follow-up. I was hoping you can give a little bit more detail on the U&H deal in terms of the economics and potential savings, so there anyway to quantify what billing and collection function cost to you guys to run maybe some percentage of what may be saved and may be help us if there is some level of guarantee on the other side. So, if bad debt expense for whatever the reason to actually go up as opposed to go down, are there certain protections in that contract that you that you there are guaranteed savings? And then just any other read through on this relationship and potential for you all to get back in network on the lab side with U&H, have you had any of those discussions at this point. Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks. Let me start and I'll ask Mark to provide little more color on the back end of this. First of all what we've committed is continued march of making their business better and when we see better, we want to improve our quality service and at the same time making it more efficient. And our goal, as you for that is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to improvement of $1.3 million by the end of 2017 and that's run rate savings if you recall that versus a benchmark of 2011 and as you know we've been on a great march of showing progress on that and what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business and we think this relationship with Optum again underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better. Okay. And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them our building operation, which is part of our expense structure. Our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time and we have, we do have commitments around improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for to Invigorate. So, it allows us to achieve our goal and also it extends beyond 2017 obviously since this is a 10-year relationship. Second is as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have, is to provide better transparency to the patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered and so they can pay us more often, and more and more quickly and we believe by providing that with the help of Optum will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't to expect that we would, but it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do, continue to drive progress of this business. The last part of your question is how does this affect our relationship with United Health? What I said when we announced this relationship and I know United Health will say the same, is it can't hurt and again that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity of us to them in a much broader more significant way that ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship with Wellness that I talked about earlier, what we could do around their healthcare businesses that they're building with Optum Care. We believe we could do more than help them with their analytic services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and we'll do with them as we go forward because as you know they're a big player at healthcare and we need to work with all the big players at healthcare. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in the November and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark anything you would like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: We have shared that billing is about 5% of our headcount. So it's not an insignificant portion of our cost structure and then just to be clear on the relationship, we're not relinquishing responsibility. So there are a number of initiatives we had already planned to work on but we think are going to improve bad debt and reduce denials. It was part of our Invigorate program in which really generating the incremental value here is that Optum is going to bring incremental or activities and supplement what we're doing to get us to even a better place we could have gotten on our own or certainly faster than we could have gotten on our own. So it's not as if we're just thrown it over the wall and having Optum pick up what we have been working on and what we had planned to do. We're actually going to continue to do that. A lot of that's involved in our IT organization, our commercial organization etcetera and we're going to partner with Optum to make that even better 
Mark Guinan: Just to round that off once again, if you look at our 2014 debt from our Investor Day, we talked about this as being the opportunities we see. We've been we've been Invigorate and hopefully will review on this one will come to our Investor Day. It's November 11 and we'll provide more color beyond what we've said here about this relationship and how it helps us with our efficiency goal on Invigorate. So next question.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jack Meehan: Hi guys good morning. Mark wanted to start with the pricing comment that you made, you know the unit price headwinds they moderated 50 Bps in the quarter, were there any notable changes there, just less of a headwind for certain codes.
Mark Guinan: Yeah, what it has to do was obviously is the timing of any sort of price changes and so we obviously annualized either in a positive way on some price increases or annualized and got behind us some negative headwinds between the second and third quarter. So it's really just the year-over-year compare and the timing of any price changes from our contractual negotiations.
Steve Rusckowski: Jack, I think it underscores what we've said for many years now that we’ve being very disciplined and very thoughtful in our pricing to the market. We believe we have a great value proposition out there in the market. Our value proposition we believe is second to none. Just the value add and the chip price we charge for that and we want to continue to reinforce that going forward. And I think this quarter's performance when you look at really unit price effect of 50 basis points, I think it's a good reflection of the good work we've done to apply that price discipline to our business and the results are shown.
Jack Meehan: Great, yeah that’s helpful and then I just had one bigger question for Optum, you obviously have a real wealth of diagnostic data that you have built up over a long period of time, one of the conversation that's been around trying to find ways to monetize that, do you think you could find ways to use it with clinical trials, like one of your peers or are there any other interesting ideas that you had around that front? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: We talked about in the past however monetizing the data we have. We see about one third of adult Americans in the course of three years. We keep that data for about 10 years and if you go through the map, that's about 20 billion data points of laboratory data. So we have nice bird's eye view of what’s happening with the American population and we’re trying to use that in the most responsible and also the best way for our shareholders. We have talked about them using that to understand how they manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with Hepatitis C by way of an example. We have also have sold that data to Pharma companies. We’re building in that relationship. We have talked about -- we’re trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles and now Quintiles has merged with IMS. We continue to have a dialogue of how we could use that data to help with the recruitment of patients for clinical trials and that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November because there is lot of opportunities for it. It takes longer to get some traction with them but the prospects are good and specifically with Optum, as you know Optum has a broad perspective on the market and they’re helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery system is around population health and how you can use this data to help manage that population that you're managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker, the most of about each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results what we could do about that to help those gaps security that we have. So lot of opportunities again come November and we’ll share more with you.
Jack Meehan: Great, looking forward to it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Isaac Ro: Good morning guys. Thank you. I wanted to start with just a minute on guidance and hoping you could put a little more color around the underlying assumption you’re making around the utilization and volume backdrop in 4Q relative to what you guys expect to show in your own growth?
Steve Rusckowski: So we don’t assume a change in utilization from quarter-to-quarter when we look at the guidance we've put out there. We want guidance that's reasonable but very achievable and as we mentioned we did take into account the impact of the Matthew which happened in October. So that’s a fourth quarter even. So with that said, we have basically not changed the midpoint of our earnings guidance and we haven’t changed the midpoint of our revenue guidance despite Matthew. So either -- we’re not assuming any significant changes anything in the marketplace really basing it on what we’ve seen pretty steadily for the first nine months of the year and then our historical experience in Q4.
Isaac Ro: Great. And then just may be a second question on margins, you guys have spent a lot of time talking about all the work you have done with PLS and then with outreach deals. Curious as you put those initiatives here in context with profitability, is there a timeline you could share or a path to when we should expect those programs to be accretive to overall corporate margins? Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so and when you talk about margins, I want to make sure whether you’re asking dollars or percentages so I'll address both, but typically what we said is an outreach purchase it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its billing or profitability when we can get all these synergies achieved and then outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability takes 12 to 18 months.  For PLS it's somewhat similar to an outreach and that there is a transition period of time a lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospitals site to ours. It doesn’t happen in the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their agents, which typically are higher cost than ours. So takes it a little while before and we get to that going profitability, but I’d tell you the same thing probably a little closure to 12 and 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year to year and half. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly, but as I said before still at excellent return on invested capital and they are still double digit margins.
Isaac Ro: Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, guys. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nic Jansen of Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning Nic.
Nicholas Jansen: Hey good morning. Two questions, first on operating income growth, I know when you adjust for some headwinds last year tied to Celera, you're talking about 3.5% or so equivalent operating income growth based on the disclosure that you gave on the call and I’m just trying to get a better sense of how that can accelerate absent M&A. It feels like I felt that your Analyst event two years ago you were talking about 8% to 10% operational EPS growth. So there is a pretty sizable delta between that operating income and that kind of operational EPS aspiration. So I just wanted to flush out how we think about -- I know there is no chance for '17 guidance yet, but what are some of the drivers that might help accelerate that organic operating income growth as we think about the next six to eight quarters? Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: So Nic any given quarter, it may bound around. So the outlook that we provided in 2014 and we're planning how do it personally update you that on that comment at our Investor Day on November 11 and so look back at how we’ve done and give you a general idea of what you can expect going forward. It is really a annual basis or a CAGR basis. It's not necessarily what you’re going to see in any given quarter. So, the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to organic growth that has a high drop through and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay for us which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we have talked about, those have really started up this year and as I mentioned earlier to the question that how long does it take PLS to get up and going in its profitability. Its generally 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom-line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it really gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth in the high drops that we get there our Invigorate program which continues to drive efficiency and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter. And year-to-date we’re up 5.4%, so that's a higher number than the third quarter.
Mark Guinan: And the other thing is as you're well aware we’re accelerating organic growth and we couple that with our acquisition of 1% to 2% growth and that allows us as they said it through our numbers to also get some lift in the operating income going forward.
Nicholas Jansen: No, that’s very helpful perspective and then my follow-up would be on the M&A front, it does feel like you might be a little bit light relative to the 1% to 2% contribution hopeful in every given year and I just wanted to get your thoughts on the broader deal pipeline as we think about your appetite given your leverage profile today is certainly capable to do more. Thanks.
Mark Guinan: We have actually contributed about 1%. So at the low end we're re still within the 1% to 2% and in terms of our appetite, it hasn’t changed, but we’re very diligent about the deals that we move forward with and as we've shared, we walk away for more deals than we execute. It's not as if it's not in interest signs that we're not investing a lot of time and valuating assets and potential outreach deals. But we do have a lot of rigor around our financial metrics and we don’t execute a deal. We don’t see a path towards value creation importantly. So really it comes down to our capital allocation strategy, which is once you get beyond the 50% that we grantee of our free cash flow to our shareholders. It comes mostly through the dividend, but also through some share repurchases and the decision is what’s the best value creation strategy and we have to feel very comfortable that we’re going to create more value through M&A than we will with share repurchases and therefore it's really a situation. So it's not a change in strategy, it's not a change in appetite and certainly there has been a number of assets we’ve been evaluating and there is lot of things we’re looking at and we are driving success with 1% growth from M&A within the range and really nothing has changed than we're at the low end of the 1% to 2%.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, Nic recall we announced our five point strategy back in 2012. Part of that in terms of restoring growth was to accelerate our organic growth, which we are doing and then second is couple that with acquisitions and if you look at '13, '14, '15 and now '16, we’ve been achieving that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions and so we’ve developed credible track record of being able to do that in the past and as Mark said, prospectively our views haven't changed. And then you couple that with our strong cash position, we feel good about the cash we generated this quarter and our using that cash wisely with our capital deployment plan. So going forward we think we have a solid strategy continuing to build shareholder value and the growth prospects both organically and through acquisition remained encouraging. 
Nicholas Jansen: Thanks for the color. See you guys in a few weeks.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Jason Plagman: Hey guys this is Jason Plagman for Brian, just a quick question, can you provide any update on the progress with the Squared partnership and how that’s progressing?
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, sure it’s doing well. We lapped it already one year anniversary in July. The initial work for both companies is to put both of our laboratory clinical trials business together and then operationally integrate those. By integrating those, we'll benefit from that. Our equity earnings we get 40% since we own 40% of the joint venture. So, we believe we've made some excellent progress and there is more opportunities in front of us in terms of the yield we see from that joint venture because it will take some time to get the integration completed, but we're starting to see some of that already this year.
Jason Plagman: Great, thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig Hallum. Your line is now open.
Bill Bonello: Hey good morning guys. I’m wondering if you might be able to give a little bit more color on the collaboration with IBM, obviously in the press release and in the call today, you talked about what it is you’re trying to do, but I’m just curious in terms of things like indications is a lot that this service would be broadly utilized or is it limited to patients where may be first or second line therapies have failed, what type of clinical data you are going to be publishing to support the validity of the information you are providing maybe the regulatory and reimbursement considerations? And then finally whether you’re building out some kind of a service or database where you can connect patients to clinical trial based on what you learn.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, thanks Bill for the question. Well fist of all as I said, we’re excited about the opportunity and it's an embryonic field, its building, its evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized healthcare is just -- is very new and it continues to provide opportunities, but it also -- it takes time to develop. So, we believe once again that we in this field need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after Bill is to get to those community oncologists, which is as I said in my remarks about 70% of cancer care is there and what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong and we have a strong presence in the United States, but by working together with some other once again, we could even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is as you know IBM is building out their go to market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics and we’re hopeful that that sales force coupled our sales force will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this Bill, is we believe there is an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care and IBM is a very powerful marketing machine and we’re hopeful that their working -- their visibility around computing and particularly in healthcare will help with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We’re offering that various plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that will look at. Yes we do believe that this will help us in terms of depending diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients that can affect and also making sure that we can support it the right way in connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information. So this is works in progress, a lot will be introduced in time and it is a good example of the evolving nature of this real effort across the world, but we’re lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM. We’ve talk about Broad institute and obviously their relationships they have with them IT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this and we feel very, very encourage about prospects there. 
Bill Bonello: Excellent. Thanks a lot.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Mark Massaro: Hey guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask more about the hospital side. You mentioned that HCA started to contribute in Q3, when do you think we'll know to the extent that you can help HCA manage their lab operations in terms of cost benefit to HCA and I guess what I’m getting at is how many quarters do you think it will take before you think you might be able to expand that within HCA and then related to that, can you just discuss how active you've been talking to other hospital systems.
Steve Rusckowski: Yeah, well first of all once step at a time. We announce this relationship with HCA with their Denver-based division. They have six inpatient laboratories that we will manage for them. When we do this, we make them more efficient. If you understand how they work and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work for profit corporations. Then we'll see how it goes and we expect to deliver and so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say can we help you in some other areas, but first piece of business right now is to do what we said we’re going to do in Denver and do that well and that we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward. And we would also say that this discussion around hospital interest and what we’re doing is building what we find is that to [C Suite] of integrated delivery systems and hospitals CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone could do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaging in this in a very active way and I could tell you that when we go in and have a conservation with the CEO and the CFO and share with them that we could save them 15% to 20% of their hospital in patient laboratory cost, our batting average if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say we're non-interested. Most times they say interested and we should take a look at this and we understand how you can help us and let's see if the numbers work. When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy and usually when we have a discussion around their in-patient laboratory cost, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 50% of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them and then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question if they’re in an outreach business essentially competing with us do they want to remain in that business and the best interstate for us is to become their lab partner or its Quest inside. So we do all three, We're helping them with their inpatient labs making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations and then the third is we're their laboratory for their -- for their non-hospital proportion of the care they're provided within their geographic area and we have a number of examples of that and probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures and we have a number of long-standing joint ventures in Pittsburgh Medical Center probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that and there is others to that we've build. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're head on. It takes a while to grow the services business, we built the capabilities, we're now executing and now we're starting to see the results in our growth.
Mark Massaro: Excellent and then quickly on capital deployment, you repurchased almost 0.5 billion of stock for the year, where are you on the authorization and should we think about a similar run rate next year?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take it.
Mark Guinan: Yes so the year-over-year on the -- what you should expect is not -- I can't give you anything specific, we are not giving guidance for next year, but you should expect us to inherit our capital allocation policy, which is basically half of our free cash flow is committed to shareholders and then above and beyond that depends on M&A and/or additional share repurchase. In terms of our authorization $532 million left on the current authorization.
Mark Massaro: Great. Thanks so much.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Archo] in for Amanda. I was wondering if you could give me some color on the relationship of esoteric testing and routine testing growth and then I guess the pricing in esoteric and what trends have you seen and then I've a follow on question after that.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes first of all last year the end of the year, we said that our advanced diagnostics grew by about 5%. It's a sizable portion of our portfolio of $1.8 million. We do not share quarterly performance related to that portion of our business but it continues to grow. There is some of the mention that had in my introductory comments show that we continue to get good growth of some of the more advance testing and particularly our last question around our work with IBM and working genetics and in that field continues to provide nice growth prospects for us. So we're continuing to get growth and once again we'll share the growth from the business in due course as we announce our results. As far as pricing, it's already in that 50 basis points headwind if you. We don't share specifics of what's happening with commercial contracting or what's happening per test but it's implied in the 50 basis points. So it's very manageable that we believe that it's always going to be some ups and downs in our portfolio of test and we're bringing new products to the marketplace as well which have new price points. So it's in that overall aggregate measure that we provide.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it and then esoteric testing continues to grow, I was wondering if you had any updated thought for the sales force. I am wondering do you have now and do you think you're the right size to service the market more broadly, particularly as esoteric becomes a bigger portion of the pie.
Steve Rusckowski: We continue to build our sales and marketing capabilities and the way we have addressed the market is really to make sure that we capture the right level of focus around accounts and with 65% of physicians now working for hospital systems, we believe it's important to have a geographic orientation to our sales force. And so we have about 108 sales districts and they have full responsibility for the whole portfolio of Quest into the market. The charge of separate hospital business from physician to just given where healthcare is today, how it's organized, at the same time, we all know that healthcare is very specialized and so we also in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, at dedicated specialized sales forces. So we have a specialized sales force or for our neurology business we have a specialized sales force for our anatomic pathology business and a specialized sales force for women's health business and we believe we appropriately staff that for the opportunities in the marketplace. And we're always trying to optimize our investment in our go-to-market plan with the opportunities we see in the marketplace and we think we've struck the right balance to deliver on our goals of growth in 2016 and we believe we'll do so also as we go forward with accelerating growth as well in the future.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time speakers, we don't have any other questions on the phone. I would like to hand the call back to you.
Steve Rusckowski: Well thanks again for joining the call today. As you can see we're making good progress executing our strategy. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So thank you very much and have a great day.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Shawn Bevec - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Through the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69%, while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS. First, on the issue of timing, we are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital – excuse me, and laboratory trade associations. Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data. And finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clear view until we see the final pricing data. In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the clinical lab fee schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it. Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So starting with growth, we delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas including prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C testing, and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health with basic cholesterol testing. We also grew in the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan. Additionally in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for six Denver-area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year. You know, hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced that there will be three new Quest Vantage Answer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace. We piloted a program this quarter for non-invasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally. We continued to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand and we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in a recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors. Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our Patient Service Centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%. We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announce the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organizational capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we were proud to be recognized as one of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included. The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostic Products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt. We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on. Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare. Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix, and tests per req. Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our Professional Lab Services, or PLS engagement, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business and as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business. Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million, or 22.1% of revenues, compared to $301 million, or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing Professional Lab Services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our clinical trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million. As a reminder, the clinical trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we used the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015. Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven, in large part, by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics Products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our clinical trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year over year improved slightly. Our DSOs were 47 days, three days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This was driven by the timing of certain cash receipts and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3. Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the Q2 [Q Squared] JV on reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015. Second, for the Celera Products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera Products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. Finally, there are two notable items on our full-year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million from the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items. Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis. Finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we built on our good start in 2016 with another solid performance of second quarter. Revenues grew by more than 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. We continued to generate strong cash from operations and we've remained on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. Now we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Morning, Brian.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: On the hospital JVs. I know that's something that you alluded to a little bit earlier in your prepared remarks. What are you seeing in the landscape on the hospitals now, and how do you envision this joint venture with HCA in terms of the opportunity set or the receptivity of HCA and other for-profit hospitals to expand into a similar kind of strategy?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: well, a couple points, Brian. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing, evidenced with what we did with Hartford Hospital and their CLP laboratory. In fact, I was just up there last week meeting with the CEO and meeting with my team. And once we engage and we have this definite relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow and we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We feel good about the progress made there. Again, it continues to expand. And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories and we're hopeful that that will go well and could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division and we can take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years as you know, and we're starting to see the results.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: And then, Steve, you alluded to the Safeway arrangement. So, how should we think about the rationalization of the platform or the PSCs? Is that something that is based in a way to invigorate guidance, or is that going to be an incremental opportunity to reduce cost as you shift all your PSC's into the Safeways?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, first of all, there's three aspects of the work we've done with retailers and Safeway is a good example. First of all, it's to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of these Safeway clinics or healthcare centers, they're very nice and so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients, so we're pleased with that. So again, goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality patient experience, at the same time becoming more efficient. And on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have Patient Service Centers, and where possible, we'll optimize that and take some cost out. But in some cases, we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. And we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access for patients where they are. And retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is if they have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go in, get their laboratory requisition fulfilled, it's going to be better for healthcare and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I just want to add in, Brian, that as Steve pointed out, this is not just a cost play and certainly we believe that it's an opportunity to grow our business faster by making our sites more accessible, making things more convenient, making it a more positive experience. But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that our retail strategy's going to work through over time. So at this point we've only given guidance on Invigorate through the end of 2017. Obviously at some point we'll give an update beyond then. So we've got multi-year leases in many cases for our Patient Service Centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites, so really this is largely going to be replacing Patient Service Centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint for a couple reasons. One is for that, because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be and there may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some Patient Service Centers where we might have four, five phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement. And in terms of its impact on our cost savings and our Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement, it's going to play out over the next couple years.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ricky.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I have two questions. First one just in terms of clarification around the moving parts around pricing. I think you mentioned that the hospital contracts are a price headwind of 120 basis points. So can you just kind of like walk us through what the headwinds and tailwinds are on the price metric?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, I think that's yours.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, sure. So, again, I want to separate price from mix. I think it's really important. So price itself, as we mentioned, which is apples-to-apples price for the same offering on a given test was down a little less than 1% in the quarter. So everything else was mix. So what we did share is the mix impact for Professional Laboratory Services was a headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into everything else was the positive mix that offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability, so we caution people, and as we've said over time, don't take math, which is mix driven, as a signal for increased or decreased profitability.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just to clarify on that impact from hospital, is that something that you expect to improve over the course of the year, over the course of the contract? Or is this just going to be a matter of we have to think about it from a comp perspective?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So it's a very different business, Ricky, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, and because of the nature of that business, it happens to have fewer tests and different priced tests than our core business. And those tests are at an attractive margin, so it's not indicative that, again, just because it has lower revenue per req, that that means it's not a profitable test. And in fact, the impact should grow because our expectations are that PLS will grow faster than our core book of business, and therefore that mix impact will increase over time, not just this year, but as our strategy would be going forward, we see more and more of these opportunities.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my next question is more longer-term nature, really focusing on 2018, which is the first year of PAMA. When we think about the different moving parts and try to better understand the earnings power, obviously there's more clarity on PAMA now, but can you just kind of like help us through to think what are the other variables we need to think about? Do you have any big contract up for renewal in 2018? And also as you think about expanding Invigorate beyond 2017, how much more cost do you estimate you'll need to take out in order to offset the PAMA impact?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so first of all on PAMA, as we said in our remarks, we're pleased we have a push-out of the date. Second is we're pleased that they've expanded with the approach of more laboratories in the sample set, and we'll see when we get to 2018 if there is a price reduction and how much it is. And they estimate that as mid-single digits. And then also what we said is if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, is one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this, and we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is they continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion, it's an additional $600 million from what we achieved a couple years ago, so we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017, and we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in 2018 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion and we feel confident that we'll have those given what we have in our perspective on the future. So that's what I can share this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there. And we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress, and we'll deal with that in due course.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. Good morning, gentleman.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: I guess you talked a lot about some of the improvements across the business. Obviously quite evident first part of this year versus last year and the few prior. Now, I guess, where do you feel like the momentum has been maybe better than you would have expected? Maybe it's on some of the PLS agreements or what bps is looking like? And then is there any part that you would point to as it's trended that maybe you feel like needs to be more of a tailwind for you than it's been? It feels like the business is sort of starting to turn a corner here. So I'm just trying to differentiate where you feel like maybe not you've declared victory, but you're sort of where you want to be versus not.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I appreciate the question. And what we've said for the last four years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services. And we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics; the genetic offerings that we introduced this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have now a very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. And we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer, as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing, and a lot of promise in front of it. Second is we talked about the work around hepatitis C continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it. That is promising. And then third is prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate. And we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our Hospital Services business, which we've been working on for the past four years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital outreach relationship, which again is a purchase, but at the same time it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is where you think there's more promise. I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, that was great. And maybe just quick follow-up on the cancer genetic side. There's so much going on and we continue to hear more optimistic things in terms of the companion PD-L1. How is your thought process evolving around how you're going to play there? Obviously you have some existing relationships. And how you size that market versus maybe some of the legacy similar type drugs?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, it's evolving, it's growing, it's exciting. As you know, reimbursement's always the challenge in this space. While we have focused on those areas where there is good reimbursement, and clearly, BRCA is one of the best examples of the industry seeing benefit from it and now it's getting reimbursed for it. And as we introduced with our new product this past quarter but we now have an expanded channel in that regard for other hereditary markers in that offering. We believe that it looks promising for us and it provides more prospects for growth and we continue to work the reimbursement side of this to demonstrate with good clinical evidence that in fact that that actually delivering value that's actionable because only when you can defend that you have good clinical value and it is actionable, then you will get paid by healthcare insurance companies. So we're continuously working that. So it's evolving but it is exciting and it's a key opportunity for growth for us going forward.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to start just on the underlying utilization trends you're seeing. I know, Mark, you mentioned about half the growth was from CLP and MemorialCare. What do you think – did Barnabas and maybe the movement of Easter add in the quarter? And then just in general what are you seeing in terms of the physician office trend?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So I have not, and I wouldn't break out a specific engagement like Barnabas and its impact, but certainly it contributed positively for us. As you look at all the moving parts, Jack, I think the organic growth is a pretty solid number, taking into account the movement of Easter and other calendar shifts and so on and so forth. So you can look at the approximately 100 basis points of organic growth and count on that as being solid and something that's a trend that we're going to build on and continue throughout the balance of the year driven by growth in our core business and also some growth in this new opportunity being our professional laboratory services, most notably Barnabas. But I'm not going to be splitting out specific relationships or engagements each quarter.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, understood. And then one more on PAMA. I'm just curious now that the final rule is out in the market and is beginning to get digested by the industry, are you seeing any different tone with either hospitals or smaller independent labs in terms of the M&A around whether it's in-sourcing versus outsourcing and just the relationships that you develop there? Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I can't say that the build, if you will, of interest around building a relationship with Quest is specifically related to what's going on with PAMA. But there might be some correlation between PAMA in that it's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee for service to taking risk. When you move the risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities and why would they put the next dollar of investment into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby? And so that's typically the conversation we have, and they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rate in every place. And, yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure, but also they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there could be pressure there. So it's contributing but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people have realized that there will be, with all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS says. The fees for all their expenditures from the clinical lab fee schedule, and so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, they could be considerable for small operators that are doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for clinical lab fee schedule for Medicare. So it's unfolding, so more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did six months ago.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood, thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just on the PAMA related reimbursement change delay, it's obviously good news as you mentioned. But it does still seem from some calls that we're getting that maybe there's still a little bit of investor confusion as to whether or not there could be any CMS cuts to the CLFS in 2017 to essentially replace the PAMA delay. I think there was some color in the final rule that suggests this is probably even more unlikely now, but maybe it wouldn't hurt on this call just to give your latest thoughts on that just to clear the air if you are able to. Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think CMS is very focused on getting PAMA right. It is an act of Congress and therefore, any change to PAMA would require another act of Congress. So their entire focus is on this. Clearly, they've got to get it right. They've been told by Congress that they need to do it with a market based approach, and this is their entire focus. So from our view, this is what we should expect will happen in 2017, is really gathering all the data, going through all the data trying to understand it. And as you know, we still have the CPI adjustment and the productivity adjustments as well. And some of that came through in 2016 and will continue to come through as time goes on. So our view is this is going to be predominance of focus for CMS and how we get paid.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Got it. One other quick one, just if I can sneak one in too. The earlier color on the Safeway retail deal is helpful. Just the one quick follow-up on that is, I'm curious whether that Safeway deal precludes you from entering into other similar large deals with other retailers in those six states that you've entered into so far. And could you theoretically still do a national retail deal like this with any third party if you chose to do so? Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we continue to have freedom to operate. It's a great relationship. We could build on it. But we believe there's more opportunities for us to build our patient access. We have unparalleled access, we believe. We have over 2200 Patient Service Centers, they have over 3500 people in physicians' offices, and then we have partnerships with JVs. So – and it continues to build, and we think this retail opportunity, as I described, has really got those three prongs. One is great patient experience, second is that helps us with efficiency, and potentially, augments that unparalleled access, with nice access to where people go every day which are typically retail stores. So we're encouraged, but we have more prospects as well going forward to expand in even further because we're not limited in our ability to operate with the relationship we have with Safeway.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. As Steve said, the contract with Safeway does not preclude us from other arrangements. But as you might imagine, we're not going to put in redundant space. So if we have a Safeway location in a given neighborhood, it's unlikely, even if we have a partnership with another retailer, that we would put another PSC in the same location. So it's really all about mapping this out, the demographics where our business is, where we draw the businesses from the physician's office, et cetera. So in the partnership in Safeway it's really important, and they're kind of, since they're on the lead here, they're going to be one of the first people to decide, in partnership with us, where we're going to put some of these locations. And so I wanted to stress that while it doesn't preclude us and we certainly are in discussion with other retailers, we highly value the Safeway agreement, and as I said, as the first mover, they're going to going to be the one we're starting with.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Line is open.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on PAMA. So I'm not sure if you have an answer to this, but I'm just curious, in terms of using the NPI from a hospital perspective, just given that you have quite a few relationships with hospitals at this point, I'm just wondering how, or if you have any view into how they're looking at that piece of it, particularly if they don't have an NPI as a hospital lab. Is that something you think that hospital labs will have incentives to get at this point? Or is yours the opposite view?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well first of all, as I said in my remarks, the movement away from using the TIN, the tax ID number, to a net provider indicator or (44:04) number, is positive. We think there'll be more labs required to contribute their data to CMS with that. But like so many parts of healthcare, we don't fully appreciate the extent of how many more and what percentage that will be. And actually, as trade associations, as American Clinical Lab Association, we're going to sponsor a project to actually do a sampling of hospitals to see if in fact there are – what this does to the sample. Because our objective, along with Congress, along with CMS is to get this right, and we said it should be market based, and we all agree that the market includes the national labs, the regional labs and hospital outreach. And so we appreciate this new approach, but we want to make sure that this new approach does capture possible outreach. So we're going to run a study to see what it shows us and then take it from there.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Quintiles JV, just wanted to get an update there given their relationship with IMS. I think you had talked in the past about potentially working with Quintiles more broadly than the central lab. So wondering how those conversations are going at this point.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we continue to focus on our integration of our laboratory operations, and that was the primary focus of the joint venture is to bring both of our businesses together and take out the cost, the redundant cost of both those operations. We're making very good progress on that front. We feel good about it, and as Mark said in his introductory remarks, it's showing up in our results below the operating income line. But we will build value through that relationship. As far as other work with Quintiles, what we shared before is, yes, we will consider working with Quintiles and IMS and others around how we use our data to help with drug discovery. We have nothing really firm in place with any of them, but I'll share with you that we have multiple working relationships, and one of those relationships is with Quintiles. So we continue to look at what the data means and how we could use it and doing some tests with a variety of potential partners in this space. So we're still encouraged about the prospects, but having some type of preferred or exclusive or closer relationship is not what we have today.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So first question I guess is going back to the earlier HCA HealthONE lab management question, and that is in the event that you were able to expand this, do you have any sense, Steve, what time, I guess, the evaluation period would be? I'm just trying to get an idea here. Is this a two-year see if this works and we can expand it, or is this a longer-term sort of project?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be highly speculative for me to comment on that. We have to be successful at this first project, demonstrate we can save them money. I mean, in the end, this all about making their inpatient laboratory more efficient. We believe we can. When we put those points on the board, we realized that that's going to be very visible to HCA management and we'll take it from there. But beyond what I said, it would be highly speculative for me to comment on how fast it's going to move.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Just be clear, the relationship itself is not a pilot. It is a firm multi-year relationship that we're committed to. What we were implying is that, as you might imagine, there's a possibility of further expansion. And whether it's within HCA or other hospital systems, seeing the momentum we're getting, hearing from some of the CEOs with whom we have relationships how successful these things are going and how valuable it is to them. So we will save them money. So it's really, in our minds, just a matter of comfort and time before we'll expand these somewhere. Whether we expand it more broadly within HCA or other places, we think the better your track record is, the better opportunity you have to get more people onboard. And it is with the Denver division of HCA, just to be clear, not with HCA itself.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I appreciate the color. Thank you. And then secondly, just I guess latest thoughts around the FDA's LDT initiative. It seems like every day that goes by without it getting to OMB or congressional notification suggests that we may see a legislative solution?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're working it. As you know, we believe as an industry that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories and LDTs. We've been working proactively on a legislative solution with a number of groups. We've made some progress on that front, but as you know, it's the summer months and not a lot will happen in the summer months in Washington. So we will see, when the fall is here, where this goes, but we think a legislative solution is the best option for us. And that's the one that we're pursuing, and we hope we can be able to get to a place that we can accept as the Trade Association and as the company going forward. But it's still there, but it's moving at a very slow pace.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. Thanks for the color.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice, UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, A. J.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, thanks. Hi, everybody. How are you?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: With the pickup in the pace around deals with hospitals, whether its contract, outright purchasing of business and other structures, can you just maybe comment a little bit on how those structures have evolved and the economics of the deals that you're seeing today versus a few years ago? Are they different, about same? Are you pushing a different type of structure? Is the hospital asking for any kind of different structure? Just give us some flavor on that.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, you see one deal, you see one deal. We've said this before because healthcare is complex. Every deal has got its own nuances as you could appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case, a good example of that is what we did with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we closed and we're in the process of integrating. And I would characterize those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, it typically gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically they say, wow (51:18), okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals, or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory and making that more efficient. So it typically becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A. J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multi-year. We're providing service for a fee. We believe that we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment, and we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business. Is that something they want to continue to stay in? Could we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing or their reference testing business. So we have that conversation, as well. And I would say the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business but we also help them in many different ways in central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is we're a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously we want a deal that's going to work for both sides, but we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully that's helpful in providing a little bit more color...
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, that's great. Let me – just a quick follow-up on a different area. So you had the asset sale this quarter and you stepped up the share repurchase as you've done before with other asset sales. When you think about capital deployment for the second half and moving forward, should we assume the share repurchase activity sort of settles back to what we saw in the first quarter? Or any other comments on direction of cash flow in the back half of the year?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, so I assume when you say cash flow, you mean cash utilization, A. J.?
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Right.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: What you should assume is we'll follow our fifth point of our five-point strategy, so once we get through the ASR, which was really triggered as you pointed out by the monetization of the Focus Products business, we'll continue to either deploy towards M&A or towards share repurchases. Obviously between the dividend and share repurchases we've done through the first half of the year, we've met our commitment of guaranteeing a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will either be utilized for that, and if we don't have value-creating deals and we close in that timeframe, then we will – as opposed to sitting on the cash – we would do some additional repurchases.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Isaac.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, Steve. First question was kind of a longer-term item regarding PAMA. Just curious if the current state of PAMA legislation has had any impact on the nature of your conversations with private payers when it comes to negotiating your longer-term contracts with them.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It's an interesting topic, but frankly they're looking at our relationship, the term of that relationship, where any discussion around pricing should be. So very little relationship, if any, between what's happening with PAMA and the refresh of the lab fee schedule in our discussions with payers.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we've gotten that question, Isaac, a number of times. I want to say again that there's very, very few contracts, if any, that are mechanically tied to Medicare rates. Yes, it's a reference point that people use in some discussions, but there's really – since there's not a mechanistic trigger, as Steve said, it's really not been a topic of conversation. They obviously want the best value. We're having discussions around the value that we bring them and the fact that we already have excellent pricing. That's more the focus of the conversation versus anything going on in the public sector reimbursement.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on 2016 guidance, specifically for cash flow. I think your guidance does call for an acceleration in CapEx in the back half of this year just based on what we know you spent in the first half. So I'm wondering what that acceleration is related to, and then to what extent some of those dollars might be one time in nature that roll off in 2017? Thank you.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, so when you say acceleration, we have had a historical pattern of spending more in the back half than the first half, so this year is not atypical. We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first six months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year, so I think it all fits, Isaac. It really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing where we consume our capital, and certainly a part of that is some equipment refresh. Some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work, and it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions. So really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year, but I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of risk.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from building Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bill.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Just kind of a big picture question on the commercial contracting outlook going forward. I think we're coming up on 10 years of some of these preferred national relationships for the large labs and some of the largest payers. Obviously the payer landscape's changing pretty dramatically. At least one of those contracts, I believe, terms in 2018. I'm just curious how you think that situation plays out going forward. Do you think we continue to have a situation where you have certain payers aligned with certain national providers? Or do you think we move into a more open access kind of contracting situation over the next several years?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, first of all, Bill, thanks for the question. We're not going to comment on the specific contracts with some of our largest partners. But as we said before, we have hundreds of contracts so we're potentially working, and what happens every year with some of the refreshes on those contracts. And in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we'll work through that this year, next year and into 2018. Generally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the healthcare insurance contracts throughout this country. And I think we're increasingly making it obvious it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those healthcare insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in due course. And fortunately for us, we have a very strong position given our strength and position in this marketplace that collectively and collaborately we're part of the network of what's required in healthcare delivery throughout the country in a big way. And we have a good, strong seat at the table.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Do you want to elaborate at all, you said exploring alternative ways of working together, on what any of that might look like?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I mean, give an example. We have a big business measure around wellness. So our wellness business is a good business, we sell it directly to large employers but we also sell it to healthcare insurance companies. In selling it to healthcare insurance companies, they resell it. An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to Cigna, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year, excuse me in the course of three years. Having that data is quite important to healthcare insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So, two examples. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product which is part of our new product introduction that we made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all healthcare insurance companies, regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk, and so put this again in a different place with all healthcare insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to share that I will be transitioning into a new role in the company over the next two months. Now, I would like to introduce our new Executive Director of Investor Relations, Shawn Bevec. Shawn?
Shawn Bevec: Thanks, Dan. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and welcome aboard and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter will share a few comments on industry dynamics, will review the progress on our five-point strategy. And then, Mark, will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. But before I get started I would like to recognize the sad passing of Dr. John Baldwin, a Quest Diagnostics board member since 2004. John provided important independent and thoughtful perspective as a Director and was a responsible steward of shareholder interest. John's life pursuits transcended his work as a practicing physician. Our board will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Baldwin family. While during the first quarter revenues grew by 3.6% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS excluding amortization grew by almost 7% and this is our eighth consecutive quarter on year-on-year EPS growth. Before I get into our strategy update I would like to briefly update you on PAMA. Late last month 27 members of Congress urged the administration to lay changes to the Medicare clinical IP schedule under PAMA. Due to delays in the rule making process they argue that the January 2017 effective date for the updated fee schedule is not feasible and should be delayed. Our view that PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the hospital is shared by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and a number of members of Congress. So we remain optimistic that together industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome. But given all that remains to be done we think that the implementation by January 2017 deadline is highly unlikely. Now I would like to shift to the progress we are making on our five-point strategy, which as you know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So, let's start with growth. We continue to seek improvement in our diagnostic information services revenues. Diagnostic information service revenues grew by 3.8% versus the prior year. We have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the sixth consecutive quarter and our organic growth rate continues to improve. Our performance reflects our continued focus on advanced team-based and esoteric testing for our clinical franchise team and expanding our hospital relationships. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas but with particular strength in testing for prescription drug monitoring. We continue to drive innovation in the way of testing, what I would like to do is to share a few examples. Well, first as you saw last week, we have been very active on Hepatitis C testing. As many as 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. We recently expanded our HCV offering with the launch of a new test that meets a new FDA recommendation to help physicians determine the type, dose, or duration of newly approved HCV drugs from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. These new Quest services underscore the central role of diagnostics in delivering precision medicine. The second good example is our new companion and complementary diagnostics solutions for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. And then finally, Zika testing. We are prepared to address the growing Zika public health concern in the United States which has been getting more attention and then funding recently. We currently have two Zika test waiting FDA clearance. In addition to advanced testing, our hospital strategy also contributed growth in the quarter. Our acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business closed at the end of February. Inspiration is off to a good start and we are excited to expand our service offerings in Connecticut. Now in addition to acquiring growth, our professional lab services strategy provides us with a strong growth of organic component of our hospital strategy. Our leanest organic contractual professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's number one healthcare system is off to a great start. During the quarter, we began to manage laboratory operations at several of their hospital locations and I'm pleased that all planned locations are now operational. We can now focus on improving operational efficiencies with a great new partner in New Jersey. This hospital professional lab services pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. We continue to make progress on the second element of our strategy, driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate program continues on track and what I would like to do additionally is to share some examples of how we're using technology to improve the customer experience and at the same time drive operational efficiency. So what we have done is installed kiosks in a select number of patient service centers that are benefiting patients with shorter wait times, but also freeing our professional phlebotomist to do what they are trying to do, provide great service to patients. In the area of logistics, our new Pathfinder Software platform is helping customers and driving efficiencies. This platform integrates our dispatching, dynamic route optimization, and specimen tracking systems into one end-to-end logistics solutions. And lastly, more clients are using our QuestConnect self-service portal to get results faster and more efficiently. As adoption has grown we have seen a decrease in calls from clients for the test results. So as you can see these initiatives that we're able to do make us more efficient while at the same time delivering the customer experiences better that allow us to grow faster. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization which is the third element of our strategy. We are very proud that we will be recognized as one of the Fortune's most admired companies. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on a diagnostic information service business. Since our first Investor Day in 2012, we have taken a number of actions including the sale of our HemoCue point-of-care products business, OralDNA, Ibrutinib royalty rights, and the contribution of our clinical trials business to Q SQUARED SOLUTIONS joint venture. And most recently we exited the Celera Products business and announced the sale of our focused products business to DiaSorin. With these moves, we have substantially completed our effort to refocus on our diagnostic information services business which has grown at a 3% CAGR rate since 2013. We inspect the focused sales of both in the second quarter and when it does it will generate approximately $300 million of pretax cash which brings us to the fifth element of our strategy delivering disciplined capital deployment. As you all know, we are committed to deploying our cash in a balanced way between investing in business, our business, and M&A and returning cash to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We will deploy the after-tax proceeds from the focused sale in a manner consistent with our strategy. Now, Mark, will provide an overview on the first quarter results and provide you an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew by 3.8% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 2.6% versus the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 20 basis points to volumes in the quarter. Revenue per acquisition also improved 1.1% versus a year ago with the benefit of favorable test mix. The quarter had favorable compares related to both a milder winter and leap year, partially offset by an earlier Easter. Our diagnostic solutions revenues were lower reflecting the actions taken to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $281 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.6% of revenues a year ago. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our integrated initiatives. For the quarter, adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.12, 6.7% better than a year ago. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $45 million in the quarter, $30 million of which is associated with the debt retirement in the first quarter. The balance of charges relates primarily to restructuring and integration costs. These reference charges reduced our reported EPS by $0.32. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues was 4.6% compared to 4.3% a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with high deductable plan. The drivers of the increase were a continued shift, a greater patient responsibility, and a change in our business mix as our clinical trials and products businesses had lower bad debt rates. Our DSOs were 44 days, one day lower than a year ago, and three days lower than the prior quarter. Reported cash provided by operations was $143 million in the quarter compared to $52 million a year ago. Excluding the debt retirement impact in both periods, operating cash flow would have been $190 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. I want to mention a few factors I would like you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the rest of the year. First, after we closed on the Focus Diagnostics sale, we expect to provide an update to our revenue outlook to reflect our exit from our products businesses including both Focused and Tulare products. This update will reflect a change to revenues but at this time we do not anticipate changing our earnings guidance. Second, I would like to discuss the two recent hospital relationships we announced and the impact of each. In February, we completed the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's Lab outreach business. In this relationship we will be paid on fee-for-service basis by payers at our traditional rates. This is good for patients and payers as our commercial rates are typically more competitive than those of hospital labs. Like any M&A transaction, margins will improve as we integrate the business eventually reaching our historical margins for that market. During the quarter, we began to manage Barnabas health hospital laboratory operations under a new professional lab services or PLS agreement. Traditionally, these agreements which represent organic revenue growth cover management of inpatients and outpatients testing for the hospitals and do not require the same level of services such as phlebotomy and logistics. Here we bill and collect directly from the hospital. Due to the nature of this business, Barnabas will pressure our revenue per acquisition as we move through the year. In addition, keep in mind that PLS margins for any given relationship will improve over time as we implement our processes and protocols that will lag our companywide average. We are very pleased with our first quarter performance which was in line with our expectations. Given that our guidance before special items continues to be the following: revenues to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $1 billion and capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, we are off to a good start in 2016 with a solid performance in the first quarter. Adjusted earnings grew by approximately 7% and our Diagnostic Information Services revenues grew by nearly 4% and we are largely completed with our strategy to refocus our business. So now we will be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Amanda.
Amanda Murphy: How are you?
Steve Rusckowski: We're doing well.
Amanda Murphy: I had a question actually on just given your focus on advanced testing that you talked about and the mix shift that you had this quarter. I guess if you look at Medicare, they've put out some pricing on some of the NextGen panels that maybe isn't so great. And I think the rationale, obviously, is that the older codes are based on Sanger and with NextGen sequencing you gain some efficiencies. So, I just had a question round lot as you move more into that type of testing and it becomes a bigger part of your business. What is your perspective on Medicare pricing and your ability to service that market in a lower pricing environment? And then two, how our private payers looking at those types of tests? And are they recognizing the value-add from looking at more genes in the same assay and the difficulty around interpretation that comes along with that?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, well we appreciate the question. First of all as we all know this is an evolving market. We entered the BRCA market, it's a growing market and we're gaining share and a portion of our growth is coming from our growth that we're seeing from our entry into BRCA, so we feel good about that. At the same time, we also realized this is far from a commoditized market. We offer great solution to the marketplace, we offer great value and yet there is different price points to the marketplace and there is new contributions being added everyday for the panels which I believe will continue to advance the science going forward. So that's not going to stop. With the specifics of Medicare and the codes again one should bring us through kind of the view on the panels and the Medicare and eventually with PAMA, how could this fold out?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, specific to the BRCA coding changes that I think came out earlier this week, our BRCA offering leveraged in different codes, codings getting more and more complex with respect to genetic testing. So it's something that we use some different code based on the methodology that we're following and we're also working very closely with the number of payers on how they would like to see things coded. So there is constant dialogue and it’s not just coding, it’s also about looking at other things that go along with the services how we leverage the information, how we share the information back with providers as well as payers, how we work through prior of processes when necessary because many of the payers have different approaches to approvals and what types of information they require to get paid on these claims. So, as Steve mentioned, it's an evolving marketplace that will continue to move and as PAMA moves forward many of these codes could we would expect to get refreshed as well as part of the whole PAMA data collection process.
Amanda Murphy: Great. Okay and then I just had one unrelated question. You've also talked about working with Quintiles beyond the central lab to leverage the diagnostic data between the two companies. Have they moved forward with that or can you provide an update there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, we have. We continue to work with Quintiles in a very productive way. As I mentioned in the comments that with our refocusing strategy, we are very pleased with our integration of our Central Labs clinical trials business into Q SQUARED SOLUTIONS, that's off and running well, we are very pleased with the first plans that we have in place for integration being completed. So that's all very, very good. And as we said with our relationship there is two other areas that we want to collaborate with Quintiles. One is around deeper engagement with drug discovery and around companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics. And what we're doing is trying to understand where they engage with pharma and where we can engage, where we have real specific opportunities to work together. And I would say that's opportunity by opportunity. And then second is how we can more smartly use our data and their data and other data to accelerate drug discovery. And again I would describe it this way as we have -- we have the dialogue we put in place and outlined how we will approach it, there is some work underway and we are testing the logic with some potential customers. So work in progress more to come, what we still believe there is still opportunity there. But we are working out carefully because it is like BRCA an evolving marketplace.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Gary Lieberman: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure if you said, I'm not sure if you guys mentioned it but where are we on the Invigorate run rate savings and kind of where do you expect to be from here?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, Mark wants to take that.
Mark Guinan: Yes, we did not mention it Gary we haven't updated it. Typically we do that at the end of the year. So we talked about $600 million in opportunity around 2015 to 2017 and we did report that we delivered over $200 million in 2015. So we never laid out how that $600 million will break out year-by-year but just by mathematics you we can see that we are certainly not behind and we feel confident that we are on track to deliver this $600 million that we shared at the Investor Day.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, we still feel bullish about the prospects there. What we wanted to share in my opening remarks are the broader technology based innovation that we bring in this thinking about how to become more efficient and how to have a better patient experience. We are finding more and more examples where frankly we can do both and we are pleased about that. So off and running in a good way in the first quarter, we still have fabulous prospects for 2016, and we still have our sites with good line of sight at that $600 million that Mark spoke to.
Mark Guinan: And Gary I'm sure you seen that in 2015 we grew our operating margin by over 100 basis points, in the recent quarter we improved it by 50. So, that's as we said certainly revenue growth is helping some of that with the drop through. But Invigorate is a critical component of us continuing to improve our margins.
Gary Lieberman: Great. And then you guys mentioned having a Zika test in clearance. Can you give us the timing for that coming to market and then is there any way to quantify your initial expectations for what the volume in that test might be?
Steve Rusckowski: No, as I mentioned in my introductory, Mark, we have two solutions with the FDA now where we cannot comment on what the timeframe will be for that. But we are optimistic about that and optimistic about the opportunity. And as we all know there has been a lot of dialogue about the changing nature of the potential risk for the American public. We think we will be very well positioned if we have our test approved to be able to deliver good solutions in the marketplace to deal with that risk. So we are encouraged.
Gary Lieberman: And any thoughts from a clinical perspective on how pervasive that test is going to be?
Steve Rusckowski: Hard to say. I mean you read the newspapers as do we. We are close to the Center for Disease Control. We are staying close to what the clinical protocol would be and how we can implement that and it's evolving like so much in healthcare every day. So we're hopeful that we can make a contribution like we do so in many areas of the business well.
Operator: Our next question is coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.
A.J. Rice: Thanks everybody. Hello. First let me say good luck to Dan and welcome aboard Shawn there. I would like just first drilldown obviously you've shown a nice sequential improvement in both volume and pricing 2.6% and 1.1%. I know you said that volume was held by 20 basis points with acquisition. Can you give us any more color about what the underlying sort of apples-to-apples volume was if there is anything else that needs to be backed out or should we think of that as really sort of the underlying trend and similar on the pricing is there any breakdown between mix and absolute pricing in your mind?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So A.J. the numbers that we shared are accurate, so 20 basis points organic, so there is really nothing else that needs to be backed out. As we did mention the compares are favorable in terms of the extra day and better weather, although weather wasn’t perfect we did have a significant snowstorm and it really paralyzed DC and Baltimore whole lot, but definitely better than in the prior year, partially offset by an earlier Easter and the holidays and vacations that tend to take place which definitely impacts our business. So that's the only other consideration but there is nothing else in that performance that you should be taking into account. In terms of the revenue per req which is not price, we did have continued price headwinds but they were more than offset to the extent that we actually got 1.1% less in revenue per req really driven by test mix. So test mix not only offsets price but actually it gave us 110 basis points less on revenue per rack and that's certainly an outcome of some of the innovation that we've been driving in the new test that we're introducing and our focus on higher value offerings and really being price disciplined as we continue to negotiate and operate in the market.
A.J. Rice: Okay. And then may be just one --
Steve Rusckowski: Let me just add what we feel really good about --
A.J. Rice: Sure.
Steve Rusckowski: Progress made on growth. And hopefully you picked up in the script; we thought it would be helpful to highlight our growth in what we define as Diagnostic Information Services which grew by about 3.8%. And the reason we did that is we know there is a little noise, if you will, with our changes with the refocused strategy with diagnostic solutions. So it's a very clean repair and also if you go back and look at the historical growth rate now, three-year CAGR going back to 2013 it grew by about 3%. So as we shared this before we are on march of improvement in growth sequentially and year-on-year and we think this is just another quarter of progress against that goal so.
A.J. Rice: Okay, and may be just a follow-up on one area that you don't get asked as much about anymore, but anatomic pathology. I know that that was a drag for a while and it's dropped below 10%. Is that at this point bottomed out or is it even possibly growing again? Can you give us a flavor on that?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. We have a very big business. We made a lot of changes to over the last two years integrate it into our regional operations, we feel good about that. And actually this quarter we actually saw small single-digit increase in tissue this year. So it's becoming less of a drag that, as you say before it was less. So we feel good about the progress we made and improvement of the underlying business.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Good morning, thanks for the question. Just really to follow-up on a couple of things. One, as we think about the impact of the leap day in this quarter as well as the overall utilization, I think in the past, Steve, you've talked about high-deductible health plans having an impact in the first quarter where services are pushed back towards the back half of the year, as well as the impact on the bed debt. But can you may be just talk about what you're seeing in the overall utilization environment? And is it possible to quantify what the impact was from the leap day?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes so as you know its complex and we do the press to try to understand the underlying business. So let's provide some perspective I will start and I'll turn it to Mark as well. As we've shared before what we do is we take number of our accounts, so we know our accounts, we go back and do a deficit reading, if you will, on year-on-year comparison of volumes within those existing accounts. Now what we'll share with you is that there is no notable underlying improvement or decrease in those accounts. So we will describe it as stable, the volumes in those accounts. And that secondly is Mark will share what we think extra day would do and also the quality of the days giving some of the holiday effects on the first quarter and then also notable bad winter particularly in Boston last year and that. So, Mark, why don't you go through that once again?
Mark Guinan: So as Steve mentioned I don't want to suggest this is precise. However when that said if you take a 13 week quarter time five days you get 60 plus days billing days in the quarter, we have extra day. So basically the math would suggest we got about 150 basis points let all other things equal for the extra day. And then, the weather as we said isn't precise but probably something north of 100 basis points according to our estimate and as we also mentioned the earlier holiday, the Easter holiday had a negative headwind for us this quarter. So we still feel overall that the underlying business grew at 1% in terms of organic revenue for the quarter that is a continued improvement. We feel really good about it and then we have the extra bonus as you noticed of the leap day and also the better weather would certainly help that.
Steve Rusckowski: And just to follow-up on -- to close off on this topic and we're happy to that this was our expectation for Q1. We said this in our remarks. We hit our expectation with revenue. We hit our expectation for EPS. We made some investments in the first quarter to continue to invest and accelerate that growth throughout the year. When we get into some of the effect that had on SG&A I'm sure you saw that but we're tracking to our plan for the year and we're consistent with our guidance for 2016.
Lisa Gill: And then, if I think about just one other impact, at least versus our model, was the tax rate and the effective tax rate coming in higher than we anticipated. Is there something there that is more one-time for this quarter, or should we think about this being more of a run rate from a tax-rate perspective?
Mark Guinan: I would say something in between Lisa. So it wasn't driven by a one-time event but it will not be the run rate for the year. So really each quarter is dependent on some mix items within our business between our international and our domestic, and so again we didn’t break down by quarter, we in fact gave you some guidance for the year and you should assume that the guidance for the year is still appropriate.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Isaac Ro: I want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage in the business. You've obviously done a lot of restructuring over the last few years, and now you're getting a little bit more top-line growth. And if I look at my model, there wasn't as much operating leverage as I might have hoped for and I'm wondering if you could talk a little more specifically around where you need to be on revenue growth to see better margins. Does it have to be closer to the midpoint of that 2% to 5% target that you have? Or is there -- I know there's some other factors, just seasonally this quarter, but I'm just wondering if you could talk more generally about operating leverage and what it will take to see a little more.
Mark Guinan: So thanks for the question, Isaac. Growth provides operating leverage it doesn't need to be several hundred basis points. As Steve mentioned earlier we made a conscious choice to make some investments. So as we put our plan together for the year obviously there is always an opportunity to deliver even more earnings but we want to be long-term focused as well. We have a couple of critical things going on in the company that we think will drive future growth and are important such as launch of Quantum in our data diagnostics initiative. We talked about one of the major pieces in that being our partnership with Inovalon and getting us in a position to drive the growth that we aspire to, we think is possible. We really needed to make some investments. We have also been investing in our we call everyday excellence initiative which is critical around what people do every day in terms of customer excellence and focus on quality and those required some investments earlier in the year just to site a few examples. So it wasn't a question of how much operating leverage, as Steve said, this is the plan we put together, and did involve some incremental investments in the first quarter that we made a conscious decision to do so in that quarter.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so if you look at the list of gross margins, we feel good about that year-on-year. We despite what we just shared, we will continue to seek improvement in our operating income margin which we feel good about. And as you know we've been on a long track record of improvement in operating income for a number of consecutive quarters. So we feel the growth rate coupled with improvement in EPS is right in line with what we want to get started with the year and we're off to a very good start.
Isaac Ro: Got it, that's helpful. And then may be just a little bit more of a speculative question around the state of the managed care sector, given the potential consolidation we're going to see there. Can you talk a little bit about your plan to try and capitalize on that consolidation if and when it happens? And to what extent should we be thinking about the opportunity to gain share? And as part of the conversation, I imagine there is always a conversation about price when you try to get the share. But just curious about how you're planning for it conceptually and from a process standpoint, how we should think about timing if and when those deals go through.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, thanks, Isaac. Well first of all we think conceptually this trend in terms of consolidation in healthcare overall is consistent with where we think we're going to continue to build values across diagnostics. We continue to offer and it's getting stronger and stronger day and a great value proposition in the marketplace. We offer great solutions, we offer great service at very, very affordable and good prices in the market and we continue to work on our presence and our access with all the healthcare insurance companies. And one of the things we invested in first quarter along with what Mark mentioned is improving our team and also our reach into the healthcare insurance portion of our sales force. And so we made some ads there, we've continued to invest in that and we put some of that in the first quarter as well. So I would say that we are now more engaged than never before with this evolving marketplace. Obviously we are very engaged with the national players. We feel very good about those relationships. We have relationships with all the national players. But as I said before in my comments, we can't lose sight, because a large part of this country and this market is also affected by all the other players, the regional players and the other blues and we're as equally engaged on that portion of the market as well. So we think going back to where I started conceptually given where the market is headed, that it plays very nicely into what we're all about which is being the strongest in what we do and very focused on diagnostic information services that offer incredible value to delivering great quality healthcare in affordable prices. So nicely positioned for the short run but also the long-term.
Mark Guinan: And the other comment I would make is that to your pricing question, I think it's really related to what are some of the critical things that people are going to ask about in terms of consolidation. And the two areas I would point to are access and value. And I think we do really well on both of those. So as a national lab we can help to ensure that as this consolidation takes place we are partnering with those payers, we can ensure that access remains or improves. And the second piece is as you are aware they already get excellent value from us. So we are part of the solution and certainly that doesn't require in our minds additional price concessions, we already can bring them tons of value by just further consolidation into class.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.
Ashley Craig: Good morning. This is actually Ashley on for Ricky this morning. Congrats Dan on the new role.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you.
Ashley Craig: So you said in the past that and just kind of piggybacking on Isaac's question to start off real quick. But you said in the past that you need 2% volume growth to start seeing leverage down to the bottom-line. So 2.6% for the quarter and you did expand margins are you expecting us to see an acceleration in margin expansion through the rest of the year or is what we are seeing in Q1 more of a steady state?
Mark Guinan: So hi actually it is Mark. I don’t believe I have ever made this statement that we need to 2% volume growth in order to leverage margins. What I've talked about was we're going to grow earnings not earnings per share, but earnings faster than our revenue growth and where we've been focused more on revenue than volume because as we've also talked about not volume is credit equal and there is definitely a fair amount of volume in this market that is not value creating. So we're focused on the volume that has a reasonable revenue, reasonable price, and as we do that and we laid out a picture of 2% to 5% growth which 1% to 2% we said will come for M&A. And I also pointed out that I was not counting on significant earnings from on executed M&A when we talked at the Investor Day in late 2014. So really the earnings were coming from the book of business largely that we had at the Investor Day that we would grow that 8% to 10%. And I said there was three pieces to that. One was we would get some continued synergy value early in 2015 for some of the acquisitions we had done in '14 including Solstice. The second piece was our integrated program being large enough to offset price headwinds that we anticipated, as well as wage inflation. And then the third piece was as we did improve our overall revenue momentum and turn to growth that we would get a drop-through and reasonably high drop-through on that. So it doesn’t require 2% as I said a minute ago any sort of revenue growth is going to have and especially in the short-term a reasonably high drop-through. Now in terms of the balance of the year, we have given the guidance. So I'm not going to specifically do the math but you can see what we're expecting in terms of our overall revenue and our earnings. So I think you can see that we are projecting a consistent improvement in our margins and I haven't talked about accelerating or decelerating or anything like that.
Ashley Craig: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a really quick follow-up on revenues, because they came in a little bit above what we were expecting. Was there any pull through from 2Q or do you expect -- was that just more of a steady-state as well?
Steve Rusckowski: It's all straight up business within the quarter. I wouldn't say there is no pull through from this quarter.
Mark Guinan: Yes our model we are not a products business, so our model is basically detailed in the services performed. So there is really very little swing at any given quarter from one quarter to another, it's very clean.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Mark Guinan: Hi, Ross.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross Muken. You guys have obviously talked about some of the opportunities in hospitals and managed care over the past call and on this call. What do you think the other vertical integration opportunities might be, like for example drugstores or something like that?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes so first of all I'm glad to comment on the hospital strategy, it's a big part of our growth strategy and we saw a portion of our growth coming from that in this quarter. I mentioned two aspects of our hospital strategy one is related to what we call professional ad services and a great example of that is what we're doing now with Barnabas and that's off and running in a good way and some portion of our growth came from part of this ramping up and then continuing to ramp up. Second is we do engage with hospital systems and typically in these conversations some consider selling their business to us, their outreach business and Hartford Hospitals is another great example of that happening and we started the inspiration of Hartford, so that's off and running. So our hospital strategy is well underway, we feel good about the growth prospects. And then, your specific question is I will share that over the last several years with healthcare becoming more and more consumer oriented, we're becoming more consumer oriented. And we have brought a lot to the marketplace in a variety of places. Let me comment a few. First of all we now serve up our results with an application called MyQuest. This came out about two years ago and we are approaching 3 million registered registrations for that service which is remarkable. Now people are quite interested in results and we're serving that up and for a small fee, we will be able to look back at their history. Second is, as you know, we have a great and growing wellness business that we invested in over the years and then also augmented with their acquisition of Summit where we are deeply engaged with the players in healthcare insurance companies. Third, is we have unparalleled access around to your specific question. We have over 2,200 patients service centers; we have over 3,500 phlebotomists in physician offices. So we have close to 6,000 access points for testing and we’re trying to understand how we’re going to augment that with pilots that we’re running and we’ve done some work with Walmart, where we have pilots off and running in some of their stores because they are looking at healthcare and how they provide better access to healthcare in their stores. And what I would also share is we are exploring other possibilities with retail in general because I would say retail in general is very interested and they trusted on how they can assist with providing more access to healthcare. It is a fair percentage of ordered requisitions for laboratory testing that go on fulfilled and we believe if there is better and better access, it's an opportunity for us to fulfill those requisitions and provide better healthcare. So more to come on this but we will becoming increasingly more and more consumer focused and oriented and when we have more we'll share with you but work is in progress.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Bill Quirk: First off, Steve, on PAMA, thank you very much for sharing the likely delay. I do think that is pretty consistent with many on the line here, our thinking as well. I guess, to think on a go-forward basis, where are you guys thinking about in terms of date for the final regulations or certainly some talk here that will be out before the election?
Steve Rusckowski: We really have shared what we know and that is we all know it's been delayed. We have shared our perspective, we think it's highly unlikely given where we’re sitting here in April of 2016, and somehow magically we’re going to get the guidelines and going to get all the date and they are going to refresh the clinical IP schedule by January 2017. That is highly unlikely. With all that said they've missed any dates, and so we don’t want to project when they're back eventually we will come out with a final guidance. But we are hopeful that we will see something this year and if we see something this year that they will play out the exact timetable. What we've been very strong on is when they come out they need to give us enough time and we've been very strong on this with our Trade Association, American Clinical Lab Association, to make sure they give us enough time to understand what they're asking for allows to put in place the systems and then allow us to get the data, send it to them, and then they need them sometime to go through that. And what we shared is once they communicate the final guidance that is at least 18 months for us to go through that whole cycle before they can refresh the clinical IP schedule. But the question you asked me really don't have any more insight than what we have said and that is we’re hopeful that we’ll see something this year and then from that give us enough time to work through and then that will determine the date that they refresh the schedule with.
Bill Quirk: Got it. And then just staying on another controversial topic, the FDA LDT regulation, or the final rule rather. Also hearing that this may be out as soon as before the election. Obviously, there's a couple of legislative potential alternatives working their way through Congress as well, and so I would love to hear your latest thoughts there. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, well first of all as you know our perspective on this is FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories. We would be consistent on that. With all that said, we have been working with the FDA, we have been working with Energy and Congress in house and also with Health Committee in the Senate on a potential legislative solution to this. We do believe that a legislative solution is the best option for this country when it comes to the FDA potentially having some more oversight and also rationalizing how they integrate that work with CMS and CLIA. And we are actually encouraged you might not have seen it but actually this week the House Appropriations Committee just included the new language in their agricultural FDA spending bill that just came out of committee, what they are stating in this bill is that in their view the FDA should support what Congress is doing to trying to put together a legislative solution for this FDA discussion that's going on and not issued their guidance. So that's just come out of committee, we obviously need to go through the House and go through the Senate but we are encouraged by that. We think that's a good piece of work, we are obviously supportive of that, and we’re continuing to work on making sure that this goes through the process in Washington. So more to come but this is the step in the right direction we hope.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good morning, Steve. So question for you on revenue per requisition is in the past you guys have commented that we could expect a slight decline in that statistics 3 point gain. Given that it's still on the downturn is there any change to that view that we should see that inflect after 2017?
Steve Rusckowski: Good, Mark will give this.
Mark Guinan: Sure. Brian we wouldn’t expect that trend to change within the core fee-for-service business as we mentioned as we increased our professional laboratory services book of business just based on the mathematics, that's going to reduce our revenue per requisition. We've also talked about the fact that from quarter-to-quarter it could change for instance our wellness business has some seasonality as you might have imagine, it's very heavy towards the back end of the year as employers are getting ready for benefits enrollment plan, a lot of them sponsor that kind of testing later in the year. And that wellness business does have lower revenue per req. So we've also shared it doesn’t necessarily mean a lower margin. So other than some of the quarter-to-quarter variability and then the mathematics as we build a book of business in PLS that might grow faster than our core book. Really you should expect that the revenue per req trend is something that as far as we’re expecting we will continue as we continue to come out with new innovative solutions which tend to have a higher price and a higher revenue per requisition.
Steve Rusckowski: Some portion of the 110 basis points improvement this quarter for revenue per req is related to what Mark just said around our stronger mix of more advanced diagnostics in the portfolio which is deliver part of our strategy. Now as we shared before we are all about revenue growth and we are all about earnings growth and revenue per req is an interesting calculation but this is a lot as we all know that goes into that calculation with multiple variables. So as we go through our business plan and execute it, there will be some changes in the calculation. And one of those as Mark pointed out already in our comments in our professional lab services business, we think it's a great business, it offers great growth opportunities, great return on invested capital. But on our revenue price basis, it would put some pressure on that calculation but it does not in any way affect our optimism about the opportunity of that business.
Brian Tanquilut: Got it, my follow-up for you, Steve, clearly you're very excited at Hartford and Barnabas. So what did the pipeline look like for hospital deals at this point?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, as we said, it’s very robust and it’s encouraging. The more we get into these dialogues the more we understand we’re on the right track, hospitals are quite interested in us helping them with their lab strategy that lab strategy includes what we can do for them, if we don’t do it already around advanced diagnostics for the inpatient environment. What we think could do with us to become more efficient in their hospitals and that's what we are doing with Barnabas. And then finally as many are thinking that's to them to rely on Quest for all their diagnostics needs, and in some cases like Hartford, they sold us, us their outreach business. So typically, when we get in there on any of the three fronts, we have a dialogue with all three and we think it’s a way of the future and we think it’s a great growth opportunity and we think we made the right investment over the past couple of years and starting to pay off and you see it in our growth.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Bill Bonello: Great, thanks guys. Kind of a big picture question. Steve, since you've come on board, you've done a tremendous amount to clean the Company up in terms of what it looks like, as strategically obviously divesting a lot of what might be non-core assets. You guys have paid down a significant amount of debt. I think the leverage is pretty reasonable at this point in time. You generate free cash flow. How are you kind of thinking about your use of capital? I would be curious on two things. One, what are your thoughts around any kind of large-scale laboratory acquisitions? And two, about something, I know you've expanded your share repurchase, but about something more aggressive on that front?
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Bill and I will start and then I'll turn it to Mark. So hopefully what you’ve seen from us and we delivered on it quarter-on-quarter is we do what we say. So we launched a five-point strategy back in 2012 and part of that is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. We think the business is a good business. We think there is plenty of growth prospects in it and we have our strategies to grow that business and we’re happy actually that if we go back and to do a look back and I said in my remarks if you look at 2013 and the CAGR since then at our diagnostic information services business is up by 3%. Included Bill in that 3% is our delivered strategy to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with that strategy and they are accretive that we can make money at. And we said that we believe there is 1% to 2% top-line growth from those types of acquisitions and we continue to deliver on that. And Hartford Hospitals continues to be good example of that this year. And then finally, when it comes to our disciplined capital deployment we’ve been again very consistent with doing what we said we would do returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been consistent with that in regards to raising our dividend, our share buyback program. And then finally as we and investing in the business which is a big part of what we do every year with the capital budget and then our acquisition strategy is with our growth strategy and yet at the same time looking for those assets that we think we can make some money on. So we are doing what we said we will do and we are tracking well against it and we are very pleased that with the sale of Focus hopefully we will close that in the second quarter as I said in my remarks, our refocusing strategy is largely complete and behind us. So that portion of our portfolio change is in good shape. So let me turn it to Mark to add more color to this.
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve and then Bill thanks for the question. We've been very intense with our strategy. As Steve said hopefully as people look out what you laid out in 2012 that we’ve been doing what we told people we would do. And so therefore while we always have fiduciary responsibility to look at any opportunities for cash deployment that seems like the best way for our shareholders to recognize value and a return. And at this point, we’ve been pretty consistent saying M&A of 1% to 2%, returning majority of free cash flow to shareholders. And so therefore when you do the math, you can see that we could fund a 1% to 2% top-line growth within our operating cash flow. As we've also said year-on-year depending on what opportunities were there, we could always potentially spend a little more and drive a little more growth in one given year where we could potentially buyback more shares. So we’re not going to be led to any sort of formula because as you might imagine as we go for every deal, we want to make sure that any deployment of our cash and our capital is the best opportunity in that window to create shareholder value. So I also want to point out that by increasing the dividend five times in a period of several years, we've gotten to a significant portion that is coming from the dividend and so versus the uncertainty of how much we might buy in given year so on and so forth, we have made a significant commitment to our ongoing shareholders to return a chunk of cash to that dividend. So that gets us most of the way to the 50% and then anything beyond in terms of share repurchases are really going to be driven by in a short period of time a lack of M&A opportunities, we have seen more value creating than buying back shares. So nothing that you should expect in terms of significant changes in our leverage in the near-term, certainly nothing you should expect and I think your question was around more significant share buybacks, I certainly wouldn’t go to the balance sheet to do that. So whatever we do will be driven by operating cash flow or by some strategic asset divestitures such as we did with birdnib in the past. And while we haven't said specifically what we’re doing with Focus we can assure you we will deploy that cash in a manner that's consistent with what I just said.
Operator: Our last question is coming from Nicholas Jansen of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Nicholas.
Nicholas Jansen: Hey guys, good morning. Just two questions. One on in the quarter you spent $135 million on acquisitions. And I was just wondering, get a sense of, is that entirely on the Connecticut transaction? And if so, what are these types of outreach multiples that you're paying? And then the second question would be on the bad debt. Obviously, it's seasonally always higher in 1Q, but sequentially it was up about 110 basis points. And if I go back in my model the last few years, it's usually 50 to 60 basis points sequentially. So just trying to get a sense of was there anything moving parts here that was a little bit higher low than what you were expecting either this quarter or last quarter? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Certainly I appreciate the questions. So first off on the acquisitions yes that was Hartford Health acquisition. In terms of multiples as I’m sure you can appreciate there is really no multiple that makes sense in terms of the seller's revenue and EBITDA because the business in our hands is completely different. So the revenue tends to be lower as we mentioned as we move the reimbursement to our negotiated rates, but obviously in all cases when we do an acquisition, the EBITDA and the earnings are much better than what the seller had. So really the best way to think about it is that because we apply the financial metrics which we give around a ROIC hurdle, around an NPV hurdle, and really driving earnings accretion in the near-term, the math would make it impossible for us to overpay. And so what I said to people on a pro forma basis if you saw our models, you would see that the multiple what we are paying on an EBITDA multiple is would not be above our overall market multiple, so it would be in the ballpark or lower. So you can feel good about we're not going on buying companies or assets or businesses at a significantly higher -- high premium. And then on the bad debt question, we did have a one-time favorable adjustment in Q4 to look back at what we shared in the quarter. So the bad debt was not a run rate Q4 bad debt, it was favorable given a one-time collection that we had that helped Q4 disproportionately. So the sequential historical sequential would be impacted by that and that's why you're seeing a larger increase from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1 but also the other thing is that we do have this continued increase in high deductible plans and now our Invigorate program is very focused on offsetting a lot of that mix shift through earlier collections, upfront collections, or PSCs and other initiatives we have going on. The reality is that the bad debt rate on patient responsibility is in order of magnitude higher than rest of our business. So we will continue to work on that and we expect to certainly mitigate that impact but it does have some impact.
Steve Rusckowski: Okay. Well thanks again for joining our call today. As you can hear, we are making good progress executing our strategy and we want to thank you for your time and have a great day.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Well, we continued to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016. Before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year. Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.19, and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory developed tests. We understand the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise healthcare costs for patients and potentially, hinder medical innovation. The House Draft Legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation; right for the industry, right for physicians, and right for patients who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed healthcare decisions every day. Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So, starting with growth, just three years ago this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continued to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and prescription drug monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015 we launched two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week we announced another complementary diagnostic test for melanoma. Quest's expertise, scale, and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's number one health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory test services for seven of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by mid-year 2016. These are two strong proof points of our evolving market where hospitals are looking for high value world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers, and patients to improve patient care, lowering cost to manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call Data Diagnostics. We launched this solution in December, are seeing strong interest, and have already begun to sign business. We are very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about our Data Diagnostics and our Quantum solution later this quarter at HIMSS. The second element in our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017. And we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes, data and systems and improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pre-tax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion. Now, we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower our costs by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promises more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than one-third of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our Leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest management system to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent companywide survey we experienced a record rate of engagement from our employees, and the results put us on par or above performance of high performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend; this is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare Outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed two acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues through strategically aligned M&A. Now, Mark will provide an overview on our fourth-quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is, excluding the fourth-quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continue to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization was $1.19, or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a one-time bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, one day lower than the prior year and three days higher than last quarter. Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These two items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the clinical trials revenue. Our clinical trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunity that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2016 results before special items as follows. Revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis. For comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our clinical trials business. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $50 million to $300 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks, Mark. Well, we believe we have the right strategy to restore growth and build value for our shareholders. We delivered another solid quarter and a good year. We're building momentum with our focus on advanced testing. Hospital partnerships are building and our expansion of our health information solutions activities is promising. We have now delivered adjusted EPS growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments for 2016. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any of your questions.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: (20:50) ...regarding the underlying assumptions on guidance, obviously you have upped your buyback allocation to over $1 billion. Can you just share with us what's kind of like your assumptions for capital deployment? Are you assuming any buybacks now and if so, kind of, like the magnitude?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. So Ricky, I thank you for the question; good morning. In the EPS guidance, it assumes a flat share count. So at this point, depending as we always talk about, the best value-creation opportunity between M&A and share buybacks, we may end up deploying more towards buybacks. We may end up reducing the share count. But at this point, EPS guidance assumes a flat share count.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And the topline assumes some capital deployment?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Right. The topline at this point is built based on some organic growth, including the Barnabas Health deal, and then the only M&A that we have explicitly in there at this point is the Hartford Outreach acquisition. But obviously, we give a range, and so within that range there's various scenarios between organic and inorganic growth.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And can I have just one follow-up? Just when you think about kind of like the early hospital partnerships that you've signed – not this year but the year before and we think about it as case studies – what type of growth are you seeing from these kind of like early partnerships that we can think about as kind of like a framework for the new deals that you've signed recently?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're building the business, Ricky, so with building any business this is part of our growth strategy, is to focus on these hospital partnerships, and we find the receptivity of hospital systems quite promising. And we've talked about in the past, we now have a number of deals that are already in our revenues in 2015. And we announced Barnabas in the fourth quarter, so that will start to show up in 2016. And again, these are growth rates of our organic revenues that Mark talked about. And then finally, as we have a nice robust funnel, more prospects in 2016. So we believe that this business will continue to build and contribute to our growth prospects for the company going forward. So that's the way we look at it.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Ricky.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jack.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Jack.
Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks. This is actually Mitchell Petersen calling in for Jack this morning. Last quarter, I know you guys talked about utilization levels and how they are little bit weaker in 3Q, but trending positively. I was wondering if you could call out the trends you've been seeing on utilization per customer throughout the quarter.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. We've talked about it in the past. We do this test where we take a look at our known accounts that are our accounts; we have about 1,000. We look at year-on-year comparison. We did that in Q3 and we said that volumes picked up at the end of the quarter. And we've done that again in Q4, and what we'll say at this time is when we look at that it's feeling like Q4 was stable with the prior year. No notable change in that and that's the best insight we have around utilization in the market that we serve.
Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then just one more quick one. So obviously, PAMA coming out and then the margin impacts from the esoteric mix shifts. Are there any other noticeable pricing trends that you're seeing in the market?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, you want to...?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No trends per se. I mean, obviously, there's mix we talk about, and that includes test mix; it also includes payer mix. So we have mentioned previously that we have seen some growth in our Medicaid volumes, probably most likely in response to the Affordable Care Act, but also a reduction in our uninsured mix as well. So, some of that was more pronounced several quarters ago. I wouldn't say recently any other thing of note. And as I shared at the Investor Day, we expected 2016 to be more like – and then 2017 as well – to be more like 2014. You've seen the results for the past year. You can see that there was some pricing pressure. It was fairly tame, certainly compared to several years ago. And even with PAMA, we're still confident that through 2017, there's not going to be anything noteworthy, and as we said, it should be consistent with the last couple years.
Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Lisa.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe just give us an update. You talked a little bit about the Quintiles' JV Q2. But Mark, can you tell us what you have built into the guidance for 2016 for that? And then maybe, Steve, if you can spend a minute, have you been successful in signing some new deals under the new relationship?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, sure. So Lisa, to answer your question directly, I'm sure you recognize, nothing on the revenue line since we can't consolidate. On the earnings line, certainly as we discussed, we expected to deliver some significant synergies this year in 2016, and I have that built into our guidance. We don't break that out specifically. It's not large enough or substantive enough to provide specific detail. But that is considered, and we are pleased and looking forward to having more earnings in 2016 than we did in 2015 from clinical trials, and then also having more than we think we would've had had we kept that business as standalone Quest.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. And Lisa, to your point about the business prospects, actually I was down there earlier this week with Quintiles' management team. As you know, we started this joint venture Q2 Solutions in the second half. We're very pleased with the integration that's gone on so far. We've built a nice management team. We now have a good integration plan. We feel good about the cadence. And in parallel with the integration, we feel good about the prospects that we're seeing in our funnel and the business that we've retained. We're not going to comment specifically any new business, but we're encouraged about the beginning of the joint venture and the working relationships between both companies – and between both of us, ourselves and Quintiles – we'll give you more color as it evolves, but so far so good.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is there any way to quantify any of that? The size of the funnel or – I know that you said it's bigger than what you thought previously on your own. But just as we think about that as being a future opportunity for your business, is it something that could be a key driver over time? Or you just think this is something that's a smaller, incremental driver to your business?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I just want to refresh everyone's memory. It was 2% of our overall revenues. What we shared at that point was that its operating margin was fairly representative of the overall enterprise, so nothing materially higher or lower. So therefore, you can kind of frame about what the contribution was, and we expect significantly larger growth on that than we could have done ourselves, but still off a 2% base. So, we're pleased with it and certainly every couple pennies is nice to have, but it's not going to be a game-changer overall. But as Steve said, relative to the expectations going into the partnership, we're very pleased with the first six months and looking forward to 2016.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And since we don't consolidate revenues, we're going to see it back in our earnings growth. And a lot of that earnings growth will come from the cost synergies that's implied in – or a portion of it's implied in our guidance.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning Brian.
Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. Morning. A question on the Barnabas partnership and the hospital management segment in general. How should we think about the margin profile for that segment, both over the next year or two and then how you're thinking about it longer term?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the way we look at this is we believe the market is continuing to look for partnerships. I said this in my opening comments. Hospitals are looking for partners like us to help them with their lab strategy. A piece of this is helping them run their hospital business, but also think about how we could partner with them in their more sophisticated testing – what we refer to as reference work. And so, then when we engage with clients or customers like Barnabas, we expect that we're going to start working with them and we're going to start to – continue to build their book of business with us. As far as margins, what we'll say is this. We're driving growth in this company and we're driving better ROIC. And included in our guidance around growth and included in our guidance around earnings growth, we do expect that our build of our professional lab services business will be accretive to our plan going forward.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And I'll just add that – I have shared in the past – these professional laboratory services agreement come with a couple of different components, as Steve just laid out. Certainly the reference piece, those margins would be similar to our other reference business relationships. And then, in some of these cases there is partnership involving Outreach as well. On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work – which previously was unaddressable revenue, so it's a new source of growth for us – those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement, and therefore we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive. And I also want to emphasize it's somewhat previously unaddressable revenues, so a new source of growth.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just to close on this, in 2015 we feathered in a number of PLS deals – so they're in our results – that help us with growth. But also, as you can see with our results, we expanded our margins by 110 basis points. So I feel good about our prospects of this piece of business along with other businesses growing the company and also making sure that we continue to deliver good return on invested capital.
Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks for the insight.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, A.J.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. Just initially, I'm trying – this is sort of a bigger-picture question. So the revenue guidance looks for 1.5% to 2.5% growth, and I'm just trying to think through the puts and takes and how they relate to the underlying assumptions. Obviously, you've got the headwind of the half year, so the revenues that were contributed in the Quintiles JV. Alternatively, you're anniversarying at this point some lost or exited contracts that sort of impaired growth last year, as well as you've got the St. Barnabas deal ramping up. So I'm trying to get to what do you really think the underlying trends are in terms of pricing, volume, and sort of an apples-to-apples revenue comparison? Any comments on that would be helpful.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. First off, A.J. – and thank you for the question – the 1.5% to 2.5% is on what we call an equivalent basis. So that does not include the headwinds from clinical trials. So this is excluding that. So the businesses that we continue to have or will be adding, such as the Hartford acquisition or new partnerships like Barnabas, are included in that. But that excludes the impact of the $85 million in the first half. So as we look at it, we talked about the price; and we expect price in 2016 to have some modest headwinds. And then mix, obviously, we didn't get to that specifically, but we wouldn't expect a materially different trend than what you saw through 2015. So we continue to grow our esoteric business; so we mentioned 5% growth in Q4. We continue to focus on our most profitable business opportunities. We have cleaned up our portfolio, which certainly you're seeing some of that benefit in terms of our customers. And as we engage with new customers, we're very focused on making sure that we get the value that we deliver through our pricing. So that's really the overall commentary. I would say the 1.5% to 2.5% is a combination of organic growth and we've had five straight quarters of revenue. We mentioned we had some volume, organic growth in this quarter, and an improving trend throughout 2016.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, that's great. And then, maybe just following up on Steve's comment around the LDT question and the FDA. It seems like there's two dynamics going on. The Congress is sort of working with the industry to try to come up with some parameters around what might happen there, and then you occasionally have these salvos out of the FDA suggesting that they may move ahead with guidance around it. Can you give us any flavor? I mean, is there any dialogue with the FDA? Do you get any sense of whether they're going to stand down and let Congress move forward, or are they – do you have any sense of what they're doing?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, thanks, A.J. First of all, as you know, our position as an industry is the FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. We're in the business of medicine and applying a device (35:00) regulation to our industry doesn't make sense. And it's duplicative with what we already have with CLIA. So that remains our position. Now with all that said, as an industry we also believe that the legislative action or process is the best solution to this and we're encouraged with what's been proposed from Congress as a good start. So we're engaging with Congress on their proposed legislation. We're doing this with other stakeholders. And as far as the FDA involvement in this, I trust Congress and their team, and also with the work in our trade association. We have engaged with the FDA as well to see if we can come up with a reasonable solution of what they are trying to accomplish, while at the same time address the issues we're concerned about. So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that would be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Jansen from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, nice job on the quarter with the organic volumes, but a couple questions. First on the SG&A trend, it did look like your SG&A dollars grew faster on maybe an equivalent basis. Maybe it's probably because last year's number wasn't restated. But just want to get a better sense of what you're viewing as core SG&A growth, and how we should be thinking about 2016 in context of the accelerating benefit from Invigorate 2.0.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, thanks, Nick. I'm sure as you can appreciate SG&A will bounce around quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of certain investments and other things that impact that overall expense. There is certainly not a trend to be read from that. You can see for the year we drove not only improvement in gross margin but leverage of our SG&A. You would expect we need to continue that in order to drive the leverage that we're implying for our guidance in 2016, and certainly the leverage we were implying through the outlook that I provided at the Investor Day in 2014. So, some of Invigorate is on the cost of sales line; some of it is on the SG&A line and you should not expect us to deleverage our SG&A going forward.
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. and then secondly, I think you mentioned a bad debt benefit in the quarter. Just wanted to know if you could potentially quantify that and think about what drove the improvement from that benefit. Thanks.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. So what I would say is the bad debt continues to be fairly stable. Mix, as we mentioned, mix is going against us: as we get a larger proportion of our revenues from patients, the bad debt rate on that is significantly, on an order of magnitude, higher than it is from the payers, whether it's commercial payers or the government. So that's something we have to offset. And through some of the good Invigorate work we've been doing, we've held that at bay and held it pretty stable. So that's what I would say is, without that one-time benefit, you should have expected to see some stability in our bad debt.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks and good morning, everybody.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey Bill. Good morning.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): I guess going back to FDA as well as PAMA, Steve, what are you guys thinking in terms of the final documents coming out? I guess we've been hearing probably 1Q for PAMA and 2Q for FDA. I'm just curious if those are consistent with your expectations.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So first of all, let me start with PAMA. So, we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document. Two things, as I said in my introductory comments, we believe they did not get it right as far as the applicable labs; it needs to include hospitals. We've been quite clear on that and we've got a lot of support now from American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and Congress to help us with that. So we've made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data, and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the clinical lab fee schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight timetable, as you can imagine. So those are the two big issues that we've highlighted. We're hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we've provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority – the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So, we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with Congress, and we'll see where that leads us. But this is going to be done step-by-step and kind of make progress and see where this evolves over the next several months.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. And then if you had to handicap – I guess sticking on PAMA – if you had to handicap the option (40:54) of them expanding beyond the labs they've already spoken to, where are you thinking at this point, Steve?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, the applicable lab? You can't handicap it. All I know is the message has been loud and clear. We got the support of the American Hospital Association, which clearly gets paid the same way we get paid. If they do not include hospitals – as we all know, those commercial rates are higher than our rates – so they need to be in the base to get a market view of the codes. Second, is the Senate has weighed in. The House has weighed in. Industry has weighed in. We clearly have done a good job of making sure – we want to make sure we get this right because it's important to all of us. Again, you go back to the definition of PAMA – it's Protect Access to Medicare Act – it's very important that Medicare beneficiaries continue to get the critical testing, and all those Medicare beneficiaries are not just in those large cities where we primarily serve. There's a lot of regional players and there's a lot of hospital outreach players in this marketplace that have to get fair rates from CMS.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Joel.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You guys touched a little bit on the companion diagnostics market in the prepared remarks. Could you maybe help us think about how you intend to win share in that market? It appears that market's increasingly becoming a more commoditized end market?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure. It's a promising market. If you go back and look at our platforms for growth, companion diagnostics, and sometimes it's connected with precision medicine. It is an important part of our growth strategy. Several things – one is that we continue to work with the market-leading research organizations. About two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering; we're actually taking their research and we are now marketing a product we call OncoVantage, with 34 actionable genes. And we're actually going to expand that panel this year as well with their help. So this is right in the middle of precision medicine, and clearly, we're providing the companion diagnostics associated with that. Second is, we're engaging with pharma. We announced the work this past quarter that we were doing. I talked about in my introductory remarks our recent announcement around melanoma. We continue to be highly engaged with all the pharma companies that have many companion diagnostics associated with their development funnels. So we're very well positioned in that regard. We do work now closely with Quintiles of getting an even better view in the marketplace and better access point for a lot of the smaller pharma companies with the relationship that they have, since they are the world's largest CRO. So, we think we're very well positioned as an innovation player; and now we're positioned even better with our relationship with Quintiles in terms of access to the market.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And then maybe just a high-level question on what you're seeing for M&A dynamics in the market right now. Are there pockets in the market where valuations are more attractive on a relative basis? Just trying to get a sense of whether we should expect to see more deals towards esoteric-geared independents or more traditional full-service labs?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we continue to work the market. Our strategy is to focus on Diagnostic Information Services. We're entirely focused on that. All our M&A has been associated around that. We've done some hospital outreach deals, the most notable one is Hartford's Outreach activity in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a nice funnel, and that's consistent with our strategy of 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. Through our outlook, we believe there's plenty of prospects to support that. And in that regard, we also have been clear that we're going to only acquire when we can have a good business case to make money for our shareholders. And many of the deals we've done so far have justified themselves based upon cost synergies which, in our experience, is the best acquisitions you can do. So, we're still encouraged. We still have a strong belief that we can deliver this portion of our strategy, and we've delivered on that through the past several years.
Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Blake from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. You touched on your Data Diagnostics partnership with Inovalon that you launched in the quarter. Could you provide some color around your plans for reimbursement there? I mean, have you been in discussions with health plans? I guess, how would you characterize the interest you're getting from a payer perspective?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We said in our comments that we're quite encouraged. We're offering a lot of value. Typically, the payment is through payers or the risk-taking organization, so it could be an ACO; those people that are managing the population and have the financial incentive to provide this information to the physicians that are treating and managing patients' lives. So, in that regard, we've been off and running since the fourth quarter. Momentum is building. We've worked through the integration. The nice part about this is we're providing this capability in the normal workflow of a physician. We have tremendous, tremendous capabilities at the desktop of a physician with our order entry results reporting system which we call Care360. And so when they're in the order entry system, if in fact they want the visibility to this information that we're getting from Inovalon, they can easily access that information. And the payment model is back to, again, typically the risk-taking entity whoever that might be, the payer or in the case of an entity that's taking risk like an ACO. So, we're working both physicians' awareness of this capability along with payer awareness of this. And we're very encouraged about the prospects.
Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Hooker from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, good morning. So my question will be simple because it's a follow-up on the last question. So, I'm also interested in this Data Diagnostics relationship you have with Inovalon and appreciate the color. And looking ahead, how long do you think – if you were to guess – in terms of how long do you think this relationship would take to ramp to sort of a mature level, I guess, over to a point where, I guess, theoretically it could potentially start impacting and showing up in numbers? I guess, in other words, how long are the sales cycles?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, first of all, we started in the fourth quarter. We announced this deal in October. We've already signed some business; I mentioned that in our remarks that we signed some business. We're starting to – we'll start to see some flow in the first quarter and it will continue to build just like building any business. So it's implied in our guidance. We do expect some growth from this business in 2016 and that business will grow into the future.
Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, what is your dedicated sales force to this product?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as you can imagine, you're selling to payers. So we have a hospital – excuse me – we have a health system team that calls on and manages our health insurance relationships. So, there's a portion of the sale that happens there. Second, is we have a health systems sales organization that calls on integrated delivery systems, and as I mentioned, some of those integrated delivery systems are taking risk and have ACOs, so we call there. Third, is we're equipping our physician sales force that goes in and talks to primary care physicians and all physicians, including our specialist physician sales forces. And so, we're training our sales force there and we have over 1,200 people in our sales organization. And this is complementary to what Inovalon already does in calling on the health insurance organizations as well.
Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got you, Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey good morning, Bill.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning. I just have a couple of questions about the guidance. So, Mark, you talked about that you felt after puts and takes and adjustments, you were pretty much in line with your long-term guidance range for what you delivered in 2015. If I look at the 2016 EPS guidance, at the middle of the range it's sort of 7%, which I think is still below your long-term EPS guidance range. So I'm just trying to reconcile why that would be and when you might expect to be in that 8% to 10% range? And then I have a follow-up.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, thanks, Bill. So, I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into that 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over three years, so it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that at that point we were obviously looking at a 2014 number that was a nickel lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So, we feel in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable, and as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, wouldn't it be logical to think that the growth comp – assuming PAMA doesn't get postponed – that the growth comp would actually be a little bit more difficult in 2017 than it is in 2016? Or are there things about either this year or next year that would offset that Medicare cut?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, so Bill, I talked about three levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady-state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate, and it being large enough to offset price and wage inflation, and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so, we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013, then minus 2% in 2014, and then some revenue growth the last five quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through, and as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed we would do through the three-year timeframe, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued to progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: That's really helpful. And then, just one last thing. Is there any way you can tell us what clinical trials contributed to operating income in Q4 of last year on an annualized basis? Just so we have an apples-to-apples comp on the operating income as well as the revenue?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We never broke it down by quarter, Bill. So the best I'm willing to do, which I've said in the past, is that it was about 2% of our revenue and its margin was comparable. So, you can kind of frame what that would've contributed in Q4.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up actually to one of the points you just made in terms of volume growth. So, what is, would you say, is the market growth at this point? I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of just base utilization. Obviously, there's been some discussion around the ACA and what impact that has had. So, just curious if you can provide more detail on utilization rates this year and then going into next year as well?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, I'll start and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continue to build our own market model. In 2014 when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions. And we say that the independent laboratory market's going to grow about 2% to 3% in value; and 2% to 3% in value has, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to roll out new innovation to the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions and that was implied in the 2%, 3%. The aging population, for instance, Hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of, with the Baby Boomers who need to get tested, so all that is in the 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is what we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say eight to nine years. That people eventually when they show up to the physicians have more need for more testing per that episode. So, you put that all together and that's why we feel that 2% to 3% – and that's not in any specific year, but in the longer-term view – is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes on a req basis would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the reqs because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition. So, that's what we have right now. As I said, in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get engaged with what's happening on – going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling as we come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in 2016.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it; very helpful. And then, just one more on esoteric growth. You mentioned a few tests that you've rolled out. I'm curious if you can provide a little more detail in terms of what's driving that growth. Like for example, are you seeing increased hospital send-outs from all the consolidation a couple years ago? Just helping us understand the parts of that growth is helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, what we mentioned in our prepared remarks is we have a big business. It's $1.8 billion. I referred to it in my closing remarks as being advanced diagnostics, which include gene and esoteric testing, and it grew by 5%, 5%. So we feel good about that. And I would say it's a number of programs that we have launched in the past few years. It is taking advantage of our investment that we made in our clinical franchise organization. We have invested in a stronger team. We're launching products in a better way. And Dan, why don't you give us the top handful of opportunities that we saw in that number?
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Yes, sure. Amanda, we've seen growth in a number of different categories but certainly saw during the course of the year growth in our BRCA testing; in our non-invasive prenatal testing solution; within infectious disease with HCV and HIV. So, seeing growth in a number of different areas.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we feel good about that $1.8 billion business growing 5% and we think the prospects continue to be good going forward.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Good morning, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael.
Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: So I actually want to dig a little bit more into Amanda's question. You gave us a nice breakdown in a follow-up related to the way you look at the market here, low single digits growth in terms of the market. Obviously, it's been a while for a number of factors since you guys have been able to deliver that growth on an underlying basis. As we think about both this year as well as the next few – and I know there are moving pieces, so this is a bit of a loaded question. But is thinking about sub-1% organic volume growth or 1%-ish, or somewhere in that range, the new normal that we should think about relative to your business? And if it is or whatever that number is, what does that mean in terms of the incremental drop-down that you would expect relative to historical levels on the volume side?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, so obviously we're not going to project our volume beyond this year, Michael. I'm sure you can appreciate that. What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the three-year timeframe through 2017, we felt it was incumbent upon us to get back to market-level growth and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think, as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers, certainly, besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings, of the 5% growth in esoteric, is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly BRCA is a growing market; non-invasive prenatal testing is a growing market; hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple years. So, there's really a bunch of markets moving somewhat different directions. And depending on each lab and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it would be really difficult, even if we were willing, to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year-plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings; higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics we've talked about are positive, certainly aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges; some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment; you've seen a major payer who has talked about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us. So, we do feel positive about volumes and trends and certainly expect to get our fair share of that. But it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: And Michael, just to follow-up on that a little bit. Keep in mind, we talk about revenue a lot because what shows up as volume versus growth in our esoteric business sometimes falls into the mix category. So revenue per requisition, this year we felt some pressure but we were able to offset that for the last several quarters, more than offset that with favorable test mix that's coming through the gene-based and esoteric. So, I think Steve also mentioned that we're seeing more tests on requisitions as well, so the requisition volume counts don't necessarily get the credit, but you see the credit overall in the revenue line for some of that benefit and some of that strategy.
Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: No, I appreciate that, guys. If I could squeeze in one more quick one, any updated thoughts related to some of the technological developments, or maybe lack thereof, related to some of the point-of-care testing and particularly some of the microfluidics-linked point-of-care testing? Obviously, there's been a lot of news around a certain upstart that seems to have hit a bit of a wall. So anything related to how that market is evolving; if you see any other technologies that at some point make sense to be suppliers, particularly into the patient service centers?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so thanks, Mike, for your question. First of all, point-of-care diagnostics has been around for decades. I've been around for decades, invested in it, and know the market well. Where it has been successful is where there has been a good value proposition that has delivered something to the marketplace. So, chronic disease management, diabetes, it's done well. If you look at critical care in hospitals, if you were to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, that's been an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner, when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room, has a good value proposition. But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not compelling, those promises have not really been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies. If in fact there is a better platform to do some portion of our routine testing on a much more efficient, effective platform than the current ones that we use from all the suppliers, we're all ears. And so, we never not look at innovation that could be helpful in us delivering on our promise of great quality at some of the best prices in the industry. And our value proposition continues to be very, very strong. So point of care is a part of that, but you need to make sure that you really understand what it's going to do and where the value proposition is strong enough to get some traction. And again, we could be a utilizer of some of that if in fact the facts are compelling.
Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Thanks, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time we have no further questions.

Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics, and review progress on our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7% and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association. As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS' clinical lab fee schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee for service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab. In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the two largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the clinical lab fee schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend. PAMA stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, the coding containment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rulemaking will result in an outcome that the industry can live with even if it takes a bit more time to finalize. Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Well, let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy. First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continued to grow. We also saw significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business. Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy, called KEYTRUDA, as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy, called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an Agilent company. Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their in-patient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year. Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our three information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians, our IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and finally, our Quest analytics platform. In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point of service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level. This solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history gives relevant quality metrics through the use of big data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely when and where clinicians need them most. We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume to value-based healthcare. The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes data and systems, and improving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only eight healthcare equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index and one of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized the joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now known as Q2 Solutions, is off to a great start with strong culture built on collaborative strengths of both JV partners. We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for non-core assets and are focused on building value for our shareholders. And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy; delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced two acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline. Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion increased by 0.9% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a GAAP, or reported basis revenues, were lower by 1.3%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth Moving to our diagnostic solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, diagnostic solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program. In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago. In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pre-tax gain on our contribution to the clinical trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share principally due to restructuring and integration costs. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, two days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter. As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the healthcare bill paid by patients. Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter, related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter compared to $102 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first three quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first nine months of the year. Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with the tightening on both ends of the range. Adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. While we delivered another solid quarter as many of you recall at last year's Investors Day, we shared our expectation that we would deliver revenue growth of 2% to 5% and earnings growth of 8% to 10% over the next three years. Through the first nine months of this year, we are meeting that outlook. Revenues are up by more than 2% on an equivalent basis and earnings are up by 10% from a year ago. We're pleased with our performance and are on track to meet our expectations for the full year. I'd like to say that 45,000 dedicated employees that work at Quest remain focused on delivering a superior customer experience every day. This commitment is helping us to execute our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. The first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Isaac.
Operator: Sir, please check your mute button.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Isaac? You want to move onto the next question, Christine? And if Isaac comes back in, we'll take him.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, hi. Good morning.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ricky.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So just had kind of like a follow-up question on the volume and one on PAMA. So we talked a lot over kind of like the first half of the year about the easing comp into second half around the contracts, right, with your anniversary from last year. We haven't really kind of like seen a significant uptick in the third quarter; so can you just kind of like walk us through kind of like what you're seeing in evolving environment and how should we be thinking about volumes for the remaining of the year?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So thanks, Ricky. Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made. Then, we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3 and Mark and I will tag team this. First of all, if you recall, back in 2017, we said at our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes and we needed to first slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and that it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. If you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last four consecutive quarters, we've seen our organic revenue growing by 1%, so we are making progress. And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger req portion of our business and the richer req portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated, esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last two quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both in revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter. And then also, our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also grow through acquisitions. We do plan in our strategy 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions with the exception of MemorialCare and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did hear in my commentary, we do have a strong M&A pipeline and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead. So let me turn now to Mark of what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and the general environment we're seeing.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, so thanks, Steve. Ricky, as Steve mentioned, we are making progress. We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on the utilization basis. And what I would point to is there was some softness broadly across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August and it rebounded a little bit in September. It was certainly stronger in September. And we've also shared that we have what we call the same account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also have been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets. So, just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So, yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based; certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, despite that, we still are continuing to progress and restoring our growth.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then just a one follow-up on PAMA; I mean, Steve, obviously you kind of like you highlighted it in your prepared comments. When we think about kind of like the current proposed kind of like rate cuts and when you think about your mix, how should we think about the potential impact if it were to be implemented in 2017 now that you have the data points?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, first of all, the final guidelines are not out and as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance – those guidelines and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. I want to say us; it's myself as Chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Laboratory Association with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data. As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand there are applicable law – lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physicians' offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services, so that's a big problem. Second is, if you look to the timing, they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent concerned parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guideline and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we could start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. While we can't provide the data until we have a final rule, so that's a contradiction in what they've sent out. So we're going to talk to them about that. So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late and, again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is, it's already late and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the clinical lab fee schedule. As far as the potential reductions of our clinical lab fee schedule, until we collect the data and I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be. Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the Avalere study from the trade association. There were notable differences when you do a fair representative review of the marketplace and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they've sent out, they did speak to a couple of estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of our revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about this, but it's 12% of our revenues or whatever reduction there may be would have an effect on that 12%. So, hopefully that's clear.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hey. Good morning.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): So I guess, a follow-up on the utilization comment, I was hoping you could just add a little color to the comment around some of the market softness that you're seeing. Was that I guess overall utilization or should we think about that being specific to any particular sub-segment, like drug testing for example?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Mark, you want to...
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, that was overall. That was not segment specific. Generally, when we're commenting it's the largest portion of our business that we're commenting on any – not any of the unique sub-segments. So actually, we saw some pockets of strength so it seems as if some hiring may have picked up in the economy so actually that business is doing better than the broader business but it's kind of the base overall routine in esoteric testing volumes compared to the trend we have seen earlier seem to slow a bit in July and August especially.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And though we did see, as we said, we did see some pick-up at the end of the quarter and we did see good growth once again in our genetic and esoteric business. We said that last quarter as well. We're encouraged by that and our results on revenue per req is reflecting that. And we think that's an important aspect of our strategy for growth and an important aspect of our strategy for growing earnings, and you're seeing it reflected in our numbers, so we feel good. Prescription drug monitoring needs to be a nice growth opportunity for us and we continue to drive our wellness business which is something that we feel strongly about going forward as a good growth driver for us. So it's really related to the overall base of business. We do the same store analysis we talked about before. We take our existing accounts that we know they're our accounts. We do analytic on that to prepare volumes this year versus last year and there was some softness in Q3 versus what we saw in the last few quarters. So it was notable, particularly at the start of the quarter and strengthened as the quarter continued.
William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Very good. And then just I guess one more on PAMA. You certainly kind of outlined a number of the limitations with respect to the proposed data collection document. Any way to ballpark kind of where you – or are what the odds of that getting expanded to including more hospitals? Steve, I mean, you spoke pretty confidently about some of the problems with the document and then mentioned obviously that you're going to be sitting down with these guys, or CMS rather in November, but where do you put the odds of potentially seeing that expanded to reflect a more broader representation of the industry?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I can't place odds on what happens in Washington. I don't think anyone can. We're working on this. We want to make sure we get this right. There is a bill passed by Congress. It's called Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It was intended to refresh our clinical lab fee schedule, which hasn't been updated since the 1980s. It was very strongly felt by Congress that the right way to do it is to take a market-based approach; look at the market, understand what our people are paying on the commercial side and then reflect that in the clinical lab fee schedule. To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relative market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of 2016 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves but I'm sharing with you exactly where we stand right now. And we have a huge initiative as a trade association but also in reflecting the access comments I made. When you look at the large part of this marketplace being provided for by small independent laboratories and you think about those rates not being included in the market, we know that, that could create an issue for many of them and therefore, Medicare beneficiaries were not going to get the lab test and that's going to be a huge issue for Congress. So we're going to work our way through this but we're going to do this in due course of the process that we have within CMS.
Operator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on PAMA, and certainly understand we don't have perfect data today without the survey, but just as you look at the framework that CMS used to lay out what an applicable lab is, it appears, at least based on the definition today, that Quest and lab were going to be a good portion of the survey. I think it's around 1/3. What do you think as you look at some of your rates on the routine side of the business versus what Medicare is today? Do you think the 6.5% cut that they laid out is a reasonable assumption to use?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, I'll repeat what I said earlier. Until they gather the data, it's hard for us to speculate what the results will be. We don't have, along with they, good visibility on the rates. That's why they want to gather the data. We don't know what other analysis commercial contract rates are by code. There's an enormous amount of data here. We have over 3,000 tests. We have multiple contracts. And if you read what they propose, it has to be done by TIN number, which adds more complexity. So if you look at what we have to do, it's a lot of reporting and we're just one of hundreds of labs that are required to report. So we've got to go through the data. As far as what was in that report or in the guidance around an estimate, we're not sure where those estimates come from other than an interesting data point with some cherry-picked results that they've seen. We'll see what the data supports and we'll make sure there is sort of a thorough process to get to our fair rates in the marketplace for the value we deliver.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And, Jack, as I'm sure you're aware, when we looked at the Avalere study, even without hospitals, we didn't expect significant reductions in the clinical lab fee schedule. When we shared that, hospitals were included. In fact, in many cases, Medicare was paying less. So you then have the CBO scoring which is another data point which would suggest more reductions than Avalere but certainly not anything overly draconian and then you have what's come out from CMS based on their proposal being even higher. So these estimates are all over the board. As Steve said, until we get some actual data it's kind of hard to answer that question.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, that's fair. And then just one around the commentary around the M&A pipeline; do you think that some of the discussion around PAMA has either delayed some of the transactions taking place or does that change the way you evaluate targets in the market? Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first of all, many hospital outreach labs that we look at and we have purchased have a larger percentage of their business with Medicare. And so we do take into consideration what the Medicare rates will be in our evaluation of the business. Second is if that in fact is true, then we believe this could be a further catalyst of more outreach businesses interested in looking at their options. And what we've said we have a nice M&A pipeline. Many of those assets that we're considering are hospital outreach assets. And we're encouraged by it and we still believe with the projections of what we have for rates that on the cost synergies when you realize by bringing their volumes into our infrastructure, we can build a nice business case related to the cost synergies associated with those acquisitions. So it's been a deliberate part of our strategy. It's key to what we believe will happen in this marketplace that is more hospitals relying on us for their laboratory services. And the second part of our working with hospitals or hospital outreach opportunities where we help them with their impatient laboratory, we are working on a number of very large opportunities there and we hope to share some of that with you in the next few months and going into 2016. So stay posted, but we're encouraged by the progress and I think all the change that we see happening in healthcare in general is going to be a further catalyst for more interest than what we've been talking about for several years.
Operator: The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Amanda, how are you?
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Mark – good. Mark, I just had a follow-up, I don't think we specifically addressed why you guys expect to be at the lower end of revenue guidance for the year. I apologize if I missed that. Are we to assume it's because of some of the volume commentary you made or is there something else there that we should be thinking about?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's a large driver certainly, Amanda, but the other one is if you recall after the first quarter when we had a little more impact from weather than we had anticipated, at that point I shared that for us to get towards the upper end of the range, we would've had to execute some meaningful M&A. So while we went into the year thinking we could do the 2% to 3% without any M&A after the first quarter headwinds we had based on weather, especially in the Northeast, and in Boston specifically record snowfalls where we have a very important share and a large portion of our business that it was going to take some M&A. So as you've seen that we have announced two deals this year, one of them just last night, Superior, and then MemorialCare. Those are not large enough at this point and we're not done early enough to contribute significantly in 2015. So therefore, a combination of a little bit of unexpected volume softness in Q3 and then not getting a deal done in a – large enough deal in a timely fashion is really the two drivers.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on Q2. I know it's a bit early there but I'm curious if you can talk about how the two companies are sort of going to market? Is there any evidence yet of any competitive advantages from the combination at this point recognizing it's still pretty early there?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it is still early but we're encouraged. We closed in July. We've consolidated our business into one Q2 Solutions. We are now working through the integration that we've put in place. We still believe there's a nice business case of a creation opportunity for the joint venture now that will realize 40% of in subsequent years so we're still encouraged by that. And then second, to your point, the days are still early but this market has consolidated and we're now in a smaller subset of companies who are now addressing the marketplace and we believe that now with Quintiles and us working together, we have a stronger presence with pharma and we're optimistic about the prospects. So as that develops and we have some opportunities to talk about as far as wins within the joint venture, we will and I'm sure Quintiles will as well but it's still early with that but we're encouraged.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. You may ask your question.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bill.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Great. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions; so for the last several quarters and especially this quarter, you're starting to show some really impressive growth from an operating income standpoint, which is something that we haven't seen for years frankly. And I'm trying to understand as you look forward, whether you think that kind of leverage either through cost savings or other factors is sustainable into 2016 and beyond? Do you think if you don't see an uptick in sort of volume or pricing that it would be, you would have to revert back to sort of lower operating income growth or is there enough on the cost saving side that you can drive growth even if the macro environment sort of doesn't improve? And then I do have a follow-up after that.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, thanks for the question, Bill. I'm sure you recall that at the Investor Day in November, I talked about and Steve talked about the fact that we thought – we foresaw 2% to 5% revenue growth through 2017; 1% to 2% of that coming from M&A, so on organic level of growth of 1% to 3%, and earnings growth, not earnings per share but earnings growth, of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by three drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed in 2014 carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion and we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year. But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line and that that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was as we return to organic growth and there's a fairly high drop-through and that would help us to leverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those are the three levers and while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown. As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 basis points last year and plus 100 basis points this year. So we are growing and we are getting some leverage and we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out would suggest yes we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Bill, just to follow up with that, I said in my introductory comments we continue to believe that we can deliver on that goal we set out which is the additional savings opportunity. We exited 2014 with $700 million run rate savings. We said there's another $600 million. The goal is now $1.3 billion. We are nicely on our way. We see that reflected in the results. But I'd like to also underscore another thing that you've seen in the last couple of quarters and that is the emphasis we have on our strategy is to continue to focus our energy and our investments on a higher growth portion of our portfolio; the richer portion of our portfolio which is more of the advanced esoteric, genetic based services. We have said that that's growing nicely. You see that's reflected in our revenue per req so that headwinds that we've seen before in last two quarters we haven't seen. So we feel good about the progress we're making on that as well to make sure we get a better yield in our portfolio than what we've seen in the past. So you put all that together coupled with the M&A to just to underscore what Mark said, we believe that that 2% to 5% growth of this business over a three-year period is solid, and we believe the 8% to 10% growth in earnings, real earnings, operating income, is achievable. So we're confident we can continue to do that as we go forward.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Great. And then if I can, just one slightly unrelated follow-up. But you talked about potentially we could see some exciting stuff with big deals to manage hospital, even in-house labs, et cetera. Can you talk about as you think about what you're doing on the hospital side, whether it's managing hospital lab business directly or purchasing outpatient outreach business, but particularly the former, what impact that might have in terms of sort of metrics that we're looking at? And in particular, I'm thinking about capital intensity, return on invested capital, et cetera. Is that a higher return proposition for you and how does it fit from sort of just a margin standpoint?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Bill, I'll begin with this and then I'll turn it to Mark on the returns and how that affects our goals we've laid out. First of all, it's both. And it's both managing hospitals' in-patient laboratories in some form. And in some cases, it might not be entirely, but some portion of it. And then finally is helping them with their outreach business. In some cases, we would acquire their outreach business, which we have done for the last three years. And as so much in healthcare goes, you see one strategy, you see one strategy. So we've engaged with the C-Suite around their lab strategy. When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of our joint ventures we have and a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as this healthcare system in this country continues to evolve. Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring – or asking the question about return on invested capital. So, Mark, give us some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, certainly, and thanks for the question, Bill. Let's start with the professional laboratory services. What we've talked about in the past is this is really organic. There's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business where we're capturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significantly enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay. So from a ROIC perspective, these deals, while lower margin in our current business, are very attractive on a ROIC basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market and an area, in-patient, outpatient, that is a new source of growth for us on the top line. On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that and we think it's excellent for our shareholders and it is part of the 2% to 5%. So when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really those outreach businesses, small tuck-and-fold and outreach or small labs, for that matter, but a portion of that's going to be outreach. And we can fund that within our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to delivering majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So I wouldn't anticipate any significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory service business is not going to require ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and any other M&A, we've talked about the three metrics we use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year three. So we're very focused to make sure even in the acquisitions that they're growing our ROIC.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Excellent. Thanks so much.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Dave. How are you?
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I'm well. Thanks. Wondering bigger picture, do you guys have a perspective or I was wondering if we could get your perspective on just kind of what do you see overall volume-wise given your results and your perspective here? Just kind of what the puts and takes are from a broader perspective relative to kind of what's likely to kind of resolve some of the softness that you saw in the last quarter? Is there something going on with the mix of high deductible health plans, with the newly insured? Again, your bigger picture take on what's going on volume-wise?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure, Dave. I'll take this to start and I'm sure Mark will add to it. First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes as you describe it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently when people have insurance we believe they need what we do, therefore that would be good for us. Albeit, what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back three years ago, as we all know. But we've said in the past few quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system, so that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly less uninsured in this country in the years ahead, and that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward. So, that's number one. Number two is, there continues to be a push for higher deductible insurance programs offered to employer-based healthcare offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of employer-sponsored healthcare is high deductible and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that, those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our healthcare out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system and most people would agree over the past seven years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this effect, and we believe actually that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibility to employees. The employees will consider when and where they use the healthcare system and that will have an effect on utilization. Now, with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business, because we offer such a strong value proposition and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation on pricing in this industry is actually a good fact for us given our value and our prices in this industry are so attractive. So, that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, us baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing. We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C, as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested given the new drugs on the marketplace to cure that. The age of the baby boomer slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together and we continue to believe that in the mid-term to long-term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well. We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in healthcare, as well, based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us to get our healthcare from our employers, the aging population, and the growth in the population. So, hopefully that provides some perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall.
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, no, that's helpful color and I appreciate that. A quick follow-up. On the Inovalon announcement that you guys had recently; can you talk just very briefly about what your go-to-market strategy is there? Is that a product that your sales guys are capable of selling themselves given the footprint that they have, but the difference in what they're typically selling or do you have to rely on the Inovalon guys? How are you going to go to market with that? Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, great question. First of all, we're very encouraged about the prospect, the opportunity with Inovalon. The reason why we think this is so encouraging and why Inovalon thinks it's so encouraging is our presence in healthcare. So if you think about our presence, particularly in the work floor of healthcare, we have over 200,000 placements of our quarter entry results reporting system, called Care360. We interface with all the EMRs you can think of on the planet, the large EMR companies like Epic and Cerner and McKesson and also the small homegrown activities. We sell to 50% of physicians in this country; we sell to 50% of hospitals, so we're right in the center of the ecosystem of healthcare, so therefore we have a large presence. And the nice thing about that is, what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow of physicians. So, it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications, so the physician or the administrator when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all the information on the patient, we'll be able to access all that information. As far as go-to-market, like so much in healthcare, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and all specialists. That portion of our sales force will be informed and we are talking to the customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level, as well as broadly to support the sale, as well, from a real specialist perspective. So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward and we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start going into 2016.
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please limit yourselves to one question at this time.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bob.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: Hey, Steve, on that Inovalon deal, I guess my question would be, how did you arrive at a 50%/50% revenue share for it? It seems to me with the connectivity that you have that you cited, the data you have, aren't you bringing a lot more to the table? Can you maybe flesh that out?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, I appreciate you saying that, Bob. We believe we bring a lot of value to the table. On the same side, they bring all the content to the table and there's a lot of content. They've built a nice capability with their quality metrics application, the collection of all claims data real-time. So there's some very sophisticated approaches to gathering the information and serving that up to physicians. So we think the 50%/50% split fairly recognizes the value we deliver and the value they deliver, and it's a good partnership. So we think that's a fair split, but we are happy about the value I think we bring to the table because we think it's a good opportunity for us.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, Bob, just real quickly. I mean the analog might be some small independent lab came up with a new esoteric test, okay, so they created the whole test. They didn't have the ability to sell it to the health plans as well as we could, and then to do the pull-through with, as Steve said, our coverage, that it's going to be ordered basically like a CPT, kind of like a test. And so I think you'd say, okay, yes, 50%/50% is pretty fair. They did the innovation, obviously they've got the IP, et cetera, and we're really the commercial arm to help sell that and educate people on the value and the opportunity.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: And just maybe a question on the cost associated with setting this up and then the deliverable itself. It's a one page of report or a two page, and maybe just, can you give like an anecdotal example of what the report might look like? And then, just lastly, how do you get the doc to pay for it? Is the payer going to pay for it? I mean how do we get over that hurdle?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, first of all, the reports vary based upon what you're asking for, so some of the patient history are nice, well-presented summary of patient history. The quality metrics are somewhat of a simple, this is what you need to do to close the gaps in Care related to quality metrics to qualify for stronger HEDIS Scores and your Star Ratings, so that's another report. As far as the pay for here, in many cases it will be the risk-taking organization, the insurance company would be the person that has the motivation to do this. But in other portions of this, particularly related to the HEDIS Scores, it could be the provider organization that's clearly incentive to do a better job of closing the gaps in Care and see the value, and therefore will pay us for this.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And in terms of the investment required, Bob, it was a little more complicated than adding a couple of test codes to our compendium. That's kind of the way you should think about it. It's not a significant investment required to get this capability in our Care360. Okay.
Operator: The last question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore. Please limit yourself to one question. You may ask your question.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I'll make it one simple question. It's a clarification question. Just, Mark, on the reported volume for the quarter, is there any way you can break out the M&A contribution? If I'm reading correctly, I believe the only deal that should have contributed is MemorialCare; so any sense on what's organic versus what came from M&A?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's pretty much all organic, Michael. And then the quarter M&A was less than 10 basis points.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Okay. That's perfect. All right.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And as we said earlier, we expected some M&A sooner. We have got a nice funnel for M&A and you'll see that in subsequent months. But the third quarter was pretty clean, but it was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So thanks, everyone, for joining. As we have shared, we had another solid quarter. We are making good progress executing our strategy. We do appreciate all your support and interest in our company and have a great day.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends, and also review progress we are making, executing our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Well, we grew revenues, margins, and earnings in the second quarter, and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8%, and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25. This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our five-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost, we are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I would like to spend some time on industry dynamics. After two years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015, and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the clinical lab fee schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS, as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress – process. So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter. Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be net positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King v. Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts and we don't have perfect information, but what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country, as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes. These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access health care. With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics. Health care in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for test performed by a hospital lab to cost two times to five times as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality at a competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans in our networks achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service. Now, let me shift to the progress we are making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in three years. Now, let me talk about a few of the drivers. Our regional sales team are now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, CardioIQ, Noninvasive Prenatal Screening, and HIV fourth generation testing. We also continue to see growth in prescription drug monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in the year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them improve healthcare outcomes and reduce cost. Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health Systems' laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. We said before we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So, for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provider trending data, interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. Now, for hospitals, more than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy to use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices, with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls. And for health plans, we've expanded pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring tests to drive better health and follow guidelines. We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools and we will update you on our progress. And then, finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in healthcare, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space. We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now, we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes, to help athletes and their coaches and trainers, as well as weekend warriors, gain valuable insights into the training recovery regiments, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform, and patients can access their own results using our patient portal, the MyQuest application. More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gaining access to the historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results. And last result – last week, we began to offer direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where a new law just took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician's script. We're operating this through our joint venture partner, Sonora Quest Laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading healthcare provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. As the responsibility for managing and paying for healthcare shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic testing provider. The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience, as well as allowing us to become more efficient. We perform more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and billing systems. We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. Our investor day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%. Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 Physician Portal, and our specimen tracking performance are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have saw improvement in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency. The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous form for putting our Quest Management Systems tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on teams focused on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital efficient way that provides us with a path to generating better growth and profitability from that business than if we had operated it as a standalone entity. We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call. We're excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for non-core assets that can build value for shareholders. The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. Now, Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services or DIS for short improved by 0.4%, compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, declined by 0.4%, versus the prior year. However, revenue per acquisition was 0.9% better than the prior year and, as Steve mentioned, it was first increase in three years. While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure through favorable test and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene based and esoteric testing. Moving to diagnostic solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and the remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. Our diagnostic solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis. Revenue for 2014 on an equivalent basis excludes clinical trials revenues reported in the third and the fourth quarters of 2014. The 2014 revenue excluded is $41 million and $46 million in the third and the fourth quarter, respectively. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5%, to $1.25. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions, and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36. Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16. As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.1%. 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, one day lower than last quarter and three days lower than a year ago. Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash for the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt, in connection with the company's debt refinancing. In the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with the previously disposed business that, together, account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds in the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter, compared to $49 million a year ago. Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 million and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis. Adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85. Adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million, and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we delivered solid bottom line growth in the second quarter. It was our third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy. We thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.
Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks and good morning. Steve, just wanted to talk to you about volumes in the quarter. They were probably a little bit slower than what we would have estimated. I'm just kind of curious to get your perspective. If you think there's -- are you seeing any type of slowdown in the market or maybe is it more difficult comps from the ACA comparisons from last year or does it perhaps maybe reflect some business that maybe you've walked away from that you deemed to be less profitable? Any sort of color on underlying market trends would be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Let me start and then I'm going to pass it to Mark. Well, first of all, what I said in the opening remarks is we do this analysis where we look at our stable accounts, and we call it a same provider, same store analysis, and year-on-year what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point number one. Point number two, as I said in our introductory remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. As a matter of fact, you see our growth in our higher end portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top-line growth. So that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition and, obviously, our growth and operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters. We still had that in Q2. We'll start to lap that in the second half, but I'll let Mark provide some insight into that. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, thanks, Steve. Glen, you're correct that I think some of that certainly is driven by some of the business that we've talked about for a while and that we thought was lower value add, and I think the fact that we were able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter, so we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide, but there certainly are some watch-outs there, so the real important thing is obviously the tests. And I can tell you that test volumes actually grew despite the fact that requisition volumes declined in the quarter. So we feel good about the volumes. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients, which in many cases means actually filling in more richer req than what it's been maybe in the past and some of the business we walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, we just wanted to give you additional perspective. Actually, test volume did grow in the quarter.
Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Glen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS. Sir, your line is open.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, everybody. Just thought I might ask, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about what's happening in Arizona with the direct access to tests, the legislation and I'm curious. I'm not sure I've heard you guys opine on that. What's your view about that? Is that something that you would promote in other states? And then more broadly, because Theranos has been in the news and I know they were also part of seeing that legislation pass, any update in your thinking about them or whether you're seeing anything from them competitively?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, we continue to look at the best way to engage with the healthcare marketplace by state. Arizona was notable because of the new law, and we're actively participating in that. I think some portion of all markets will access the healthcare system this way, not all, and it will be a growing trend with, as I said, the trend around the consumer and that's become an increasingly important part of our business. We also have been offering, A. J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's accessible beyond Arizona. And, as I said, we're expanding that with the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain starts, where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here. Arizona was very strong in this regard. We are trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said, we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of, and we're very well positioned. You asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that is getting additional labs, as you know. Probably, it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they've received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually, interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our longstanding relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only national laboratory and its preferred provider. And, actually, I have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change, in any aspect, the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in healthcare, and what we could do together to help with the challenges of healthcare cost and help with this membership. And what we offered to him, with our great quality and our great cost, is an important part of a solution he sees for his marketplace. So we are very well positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory and their preferred provider. So I wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color of, in fact, what we have for a presence in many of our marketplaces despite news you might hear from others.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: That's great. I appreciate that. Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Sir, your line is open.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks, and good morning.
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Hi, Jack.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jack.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hello. Just wanted to ask, you mentioned the growth in Medicaid and managed Medicaid in the quarter, and starting to see, potentially, some signs from health reforms starting to come through. I was wondering if you could just maybe parse that out and help us better understand because I think the belief was that new patients were coming through the emergency department. Do you think you're actually beginning to start to see some managed care come through the physician office? And then maybe states that have expanded versus states not expanded, if you've seen some sort of trend there. Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, and again, I'll start and Mark will add to it. On the managed Medicaid side, we are seeing increased volumes. It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, to your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we have heard is those states have seen an increase in those lives entering the system through hospitals. So there's some growth in volumes there. And also, you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states that expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, and we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, it's the lives increase that we have seen, and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track this, as you know. It is the reduction we see in some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives, and as we said, back three years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do. We're at the core of healthcare, and we're 70% of healthcare decision making, at 2% of costs. So it's a very important part of getting a good baseline understanding of what's happening with someone's life. And, therefore, as they enter the system, we're going to see those volumes. So, Mark, would you like to add some color to Medicaid?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Jack, I'd say, as we've mentioned before, it's directional. We're seeing some growth in that area, but certainly not to the extent of what our fair share might be of over 10 million new lives in the system. Our belief is that it's going to take some of the newly insured a while to learn how to navigate the system. Their experience with healthcare has either been nothing or going to the hospital in an emergency setting for a lot of them. And they continue, I'd say, to utilize the hospital to a greater degree than they will over time. So, we're certainly expecting to get our fair share, but I think to this point, we're not there yet. And as I said, they need to figure out how to find a primary care physician, how to navigate the very complicated healthcare system, and then we'll see certainly more growth down the road. And we do see a growth that's fairly aligned with the states that have expanded Medicaid, certainly versus the states that have not, and we absolutely are seeing a reduction in the volume of our uninsureds.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Amanda.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I just had a question on the JV with Quintiles. So I'm just curious. I know it's been – you only recently closed, but wondering if you could share just a general reaction from your side of the world, from clients, as well as if Quintiles might have shared any initial reactions on their side. And then I know you have a temporary agreement to share data, but any updates on how a relationship might work between you and Quintiles more broadly than the central lab? Thinking about economics of sharing data, and then potentially any revenue synergies that might come out of that data sharing.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. First of all, our initial reaction from customers is quite good. We continue to build volume in the business that we moved over to the JV. When I say volume, I mean revenue and profit, and you saw that in some of our numbers, and then that's now part of the JV. So that's a strong combination with their strong business. We're doing this, as I said in my remarks, to build a stronger business when we put both resources together. And this is both in terms of addressing the market, so growing faster, and also taking some cost out. So we're going to be more profitable, and that's why we did it. So, reactions from those customers that we've gone out and spoke about how we're going to act together with Q2 Solutions has been quite good, and we're encouraged by that. The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we are going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry and our data is very strong. And so, on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with Pharma, we could have an earlier bird's eye access to what we could do with diagnostics and typically have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner with some of the new drugs that will enter the market in years to come. So that's one area that we're going to put some work into now that the initial JV has closed. And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, Pharma has data. And how do we collaborate together to use that data, in a smart way, to improve drug discovery? And one idea that people have talked about, and we already have done some of this with our data already, is with better patient selection. And anything they can do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our Pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with the management team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do. We're proud to say we have formed all of this in a very capital efficient way, and we're going to deliver good value for our shareholders.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Amanda.
Operator: Thank you . Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Lisa.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, Steve, how are you?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning. Doing well.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks. I just had a couple quick questions here. I guess my first question would just be around PAMA. Do you have any thoughts or insights into the timing? I think that many of us are tired of sitting and waiting for it to come, but just wondering if you are hearing anything out of Washington, as far as the timing of that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, we continue to share the information we have with you all. As we shared, we said the goal was to have the draft guidance out in June. Well, we're past that date. But we continue to hear that we're going to be seeing something, not in the distant future, but hopefully in the near future. They're not specific on timing. And as I said in my remarks, it's because it is a very complex task that we're all taking on. We're all engaged. We're working proactively with them. Our trade association, ACLA, which I'm the chairman of, is actively engaged with them. So, we're entering this with the spirit of making sure we get the data we need to have to rebase the clinical schedule in 2017. And, again, we want to make sure it's a full view of the market, which includes all laboratories we compete with, and obviously that includes small independents, large nationals and hospital outreach labs because that's a big part of this market, as you all know. So we know what we have shared and we continue to be anxiously waiting, as you, for the guidelines. We'll have time to comment on that. We have a lot of data to collect in 2016 to get the refresh done in 2017. So that's the schedule we have.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is there anything that's changed your view that the full view of the market would be included based on any discussions that you've had in your role?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, we've shared precisely what we shared with you, as far as the market – the competition in the market, which includes about a third of the market being hospital outreach. As you know, when you buy a hospital outreach business we have to go through antitrust reviews so, by definition, if you have to go through antitrust review, they are our competitor, and therefore they should be part of a full view of the market. So we haven't got any kind of push-back on that at all. So we continue to believe that we will be included because they should be included.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line is open.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Great.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call. Sort of a big picture question here on the hospital strategy. I'm just wondering if there's any metrics at all that you can share with us to give us some indication of how those deals are going. I don't know if there's a growth metric at what you've acquired or partnered with or a profit improvement or just something that gives us a sense of how that strategy is going and then just your thoughts on continued activity there going forward.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah. Well first of all, we continue to be very encouraged. I would say that the interest on the lab strategy for hospitals and integrated delivery systems continues to grow. As I said in my comments, we are very encouraged by our funnel and our discussions. When you enter into discussions with large organizations, it takes a longer time to come to conclusion, but we're making progress on some bigger prospects that hopefully we will be sharing with you in the second half. With all that said, we've talked about us closing on a number ever opportunities already, and what I'll share with you in the back half, you'll see some more. We have not broken it out because typically what we do, Bill, is we take these opportunities and we fold those into our regions and that's how we can get synergies and we can have advantages for hospital systems working with us. In some cases, we offload some of the hospital test menu and we move them into our closely located laboratories, which allows them to benefit from our effectiveness and our cost structure within that hospital environment. So it's more difficult to tease it out, but we are encouraged by the trend and we think this is something that we've invested in as part of our growth strategy. We feel good that we've put our bets in a good place and there will be more to come on this in the quarters to come.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Thank you very much.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Bill, as we shared, the six deals we closed in the prior year, were about worth $40 million in revenue. I will also mention that some of the first teals we did were smaller. It was kind of our proof point. So you shouldn't assume that that's the average deal we might close going forward. So as we've gotten more learning, we got more confident. We've engaged actually with some deals with the potential to be much larger than the average we've closed thus far.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Oh, very helpful. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the detailed EPS guidance in the press release. The overall number, the $470 million to $485 million is the same. The components moved around somewhat. Would it be possible just to go through those and sort of get some color on what each line item is moving around for?
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Yes, typically in the press release tables, we update some of the line items around restructuring and some of the adjustments just for the year-to-date impact as much as anything else.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. So for the restructuring we should expect, I guess, that to continue to increase and then the -
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: That will increase as we move throughout the year with those adjustments, yeah.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And the diluted EPS, I guess, will be offset by that? So sort of assuming all else being equal, the total number to remain unchanged but the components to move around?
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: That's fair.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Any reason you guys do it that way and not sort of put the restructuring where you would expect the spending should be?
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Not particularly. I mean, this is how we've done it historically and it's just based on our latest updates and latest actual results at that point.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Gary, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant gain on the creation of the joint venture, so that will be an adjustment in the other direction. What we also have mentioned is our attempt is to provide better information. That's why we do these adjustments and if you look at a three-year period, from 2012 through 2014, actually adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings are very, very close. So we have adjustments up, we have adjustments down. We're trying to provide clarity and to Dan's point, the reason we do the tables we have, is not that we're wed to anything specifically, but we're trying to be consistent to make it easier and clearer on our stakeholders.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up, just on pricing, what are you seeing from competitors? Going back to Theranos, Theranos has put out sort of their very specific test menu with prices. Is that having any impact in your conversation with payers?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're tracking to where we expect it to be for this year and also over the last three years. We have shared our guidance about three years ago, as far as what we expect to be seeing for price impact. We're in that envelope. So we feel good about our visibility on that. We've delivered on what we said it would be to you all. So you should have confidence we have a good handle on this. As far as pricing is concerned for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, based upon what we know about the clinical ad fee schedule and the physician fee schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast of what happens there. As far as visibility and pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you were just to go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition, you see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace and as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing, and as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So, how this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and how our prices affect kind of general visible and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, there's wide disparities on prices. Hospital outreach organizations are sometimes in the neighborhood of two to five times more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all of that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right in back of all that because we think that serves us very well, because our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace. And so the more volume we get around that, the better for us, we believe.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, and I just want to add this important distinction. So the direct-to-consumer prices are really a self-pay price. So for anybody who's got commercial insurance, and depending on your plan, even if you make the decision yourself on a test, there could be coverage and there might be coverage, you'll get the negotiated commercial rate. And in fact, our prices with people who have commercial insurance are not all that different than the competitor mentioned. So we feel pricing is actually an advantage for us. We'd like to see more transparency. Our largest national provider has a tool where people who are a part of their plan can go to their site and can actually shop and we think that's a real positive thing. So we're in support of pricing transparency. But there is a difference between what self-pay price might be and what people have under their commercial coverage
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Good morning, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: So, just one quick housekeeping question. I apologize if I missed this. Did you give the acquisition contribution specifically related to volume in the quarter?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We did not because the acquisitions pretty much – (49:19) anniversaried in Q1 and Summit was at the very beginning of April. So it's just inconsequential, so we didn't tease that out.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Perfect. That's helpful. I just want to type the model there. And then, you talked a lot about the pipeline related to the hospital businesses, and obviously, also, your M&A strategy. As you think about the moving pieces related to regulatory changes between SCOTUS finally being decided, the upcoming pending decision on PAMA, whichever way that's going to shake out, how does that impact the M&A environment? How does it impact the discussions you're having as part of that pipeline? Is there a rush to get deals done in the face of uncertainty related to the moving piece? Is there a wait and see until we get particularly something like PAMA out of the way? So I would think that either way, whichever way PAMA shakes out, it would probably open up some opportunities in terms of closing down or closing out deals in the pipeline versus what you may have right now. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how that's changed the discussion, if anything, if that's had any impact as well on the types of multiples that sellers want from you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, we just say, in general, it's not changing our pace of our acquisition portion of our strategy. We have always had and will continue to have going forward, as a portion of our Restore growth strategy, of having about 1% to 2% top-line growth from acquisitions. So our growth strategy is both organic and through acquisitions. So, it's an important part of our strategy. And because of that, we've been actively engaged on it. We announced the Memorial deal already. We said that we have more in our pipeline, so you should expect that there will be something else to come. As far as the deals itself, we continue to be very disciplined with how an acquisition would fit into our strategy, it has to be strategically aligned, and we have to meet our financial thresholds. And when we look at that, we continue to be prospective on what we think might happen with payment going forward. And you did mention PAMA and what could happen with the clinical lab fee schedule, but it is an unknown for the whole industry. So, I would say in general, that's not an active consideration right now, and just what's happening in the general environment is not changing our pace or perspective on any of this right now.
Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks, Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Mark, can you just give us a sense of maybe where you are on Invigorate in terms of realized savings at this point halfway through the year, and what you expect for all of 2015? And then maybe just qualitatively, give us a sense of where you see some of the savings coming from.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, so we haven't broken out the incremental $600 million that we talked about, taking us from over $700 million at the end of 2014 to $1.3 billion over the next several years. So we haven't broken that down by year, having suggested that it's proportional. However, obviously, you can see, as we committed, that some of that Invigorate is now starting to help us to actually grow profitability and not just to offset some of the headwinds. So we haven't teased out the exact numbers at this point, Whit, but you shouldn't expect that it should be skewed heavily in one direction or another. The $600 million is going to be fairly steady over the next couple of years.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe just qualitatively, just maybe where do you see a lot of the savings coming from at this point?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, so it's the things we talked about. Obviously, you start with some of the things, basic, such as procurement excellence, certainly some of the lab efficiencies that we're driving through our Quest Management System. We did talk about some things that probably are going to be skewed toward the back end in terms of the full savings that Jim Davis referred to specifically, the three planks about e-enablement, certainly getting paid more for the work that we do and the value that we provide, those things. Some of the things are going to take a little longer, though certainly were in the early stages. We've talked about starting to implement credit cards in our patient service centers, starting to put them in some – inner office (53:46) to actually get payment more upfront, instead of having to chase it after the fact, more similar to what the rest of the healthcare industry has been doing for quite a while. So, it's not as if some of these things are going to not start until the back end, but some of them are just going to take longer to get to their full level of savings. All of those things, along with some of the things that we've been doing for the last several years, are going to continue to help us drive Invigorate up to that next level of $1.3 billion.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No, that's helpful. And maybe just one last one for Steve. I mean, obviously, CMS has missed the statutory deadline to publish the clinical lab fee schedule. And just any idea why we haven't seen this, and just any updated expectations and thoughts on PAMA and the data collection process?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All I can share is when we've engaged with them, and I said this in my remarks, this is very complex. There's – we're one of thousands of laboratories. We have thousands of tests. They need to – and we have hundreds of payer contracts, and we're one. So if you go through the math, I mean, the degree of complexity by code is significant. So they're trying to understand how they collect the data in a reasonable way, and then curate that data to be able to make some sense out of it. And so as they got into it, it is a tall order for them to try to accomplish. So that's what I would share as the reason why I believe that they have not, missed the deadline and continue to be silent on when they think they're going to get this done. With all that said, it is what we have to try to figure out, and we do want to continue to work with them in good faith as an industry to get this put together, so we can get the data and have them share with us what they think the clinical lab fee schedule will be in 2017. So that's what I can share, Whit, that's what we know.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. I guess, we'll just wait and see. Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys, this is Jason Plagman on for Brian. A question on – so your organic volume growth has been around flat for the last year or so. Are you seeing anything in the market that would lead you to believe that'll change significantly in either the second half of 2015 or 2016?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, what we have shared is that some portion of that organic volume for us is related to decisions we have made. And some of those are strategic as far as where we're focusing our energy in the higher end portion of our portfolio, and some of it is around customers. And we also have shared in the back half, some of that becomes an easier comp for us. And, Mark, why don't you just share perspective on what we've talked about in the last three quarters or four quarters and then what will happen in the back half with our organic performance on volumes and revenue?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, well, as I noted before, you've seen that despite some volume declines, we've actually been able to grow revenue the last several quarters. So first off, I want to mention that. But yes, as Steve mentioned, we did have some of that volume, less profitable volume that we walked away from, and that's gotten behind us. And then we did also cite some competitive losses, Department of Defense was one of them that was a while back. A lot of the implementation really happened over the last 12 months. And then there was a large Blue's plan in Philadelphia, Independence Blue Cross, where we were at par with our chief competitor, and they negotiated a rate to exclude us. So we did have that loss. Now, that again largely gets behind us as we go into the back half of the year. So those two large losses combined with the volumes that we walked away from have made volume certainly a headwind over the last 12 months, but those comps get a lot easier in the back half.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just to underscore what Mark has said, we continue to share with you that our Restore growth plan is both organic and through acquisition. We feel very good that in the first half, we grew greater than 3% growth in revenues. It's a good number. Some portion out of that is organic and some portion through acquisitions. As you know, in the second quarter, we were lighter in acquisitions, and we provided you guidance in the back half of the year. And that 3% growth has allowed us to grow earnings at the level that we have, and it's real earnings. If you look at our operating income, it's up nicely versus last year. We're proud of that. And, also, we've gotten expansion, margin expansion. So, we think we've got the right formula here that we're working, and we'll continue that formula because at the end of the day, as you all know, the way we're going to get our value up for this company is to continue to grow our earnings, and we think we're on the right path to do that.
Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ricky.
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in. So, a couple of questions, follow-up questions here. First of all, Mark, you highlight the fact that test volumes were actually up despite requisition coming down. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on, on average, how many tests per requisition you're seeing now, and how does this compares to kind of maybe last quarter or last year? And then also, how does this go over to pricing? I mean, obviously, that should be positive for average revenue per requisition, but just that we get a sense because pricing was positive for the first time in a very long time. I know you talked about esoteric is a positive trend, but if you can just help us kind of like think about number of tests per requisition versus test mix.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Ricky, your first question, we have provided some visibility on our requisition volume over the years and also what tests we have seen annually. And, Dan, why don't you share those numbers we've shared in the past?
Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director-Investor Relations: Yeah, so what we said is in terms of requisitions, we said last year was requisition count was about $156 million. We said that in general, we see, on average, about three to four tests per requisition. When you think about that and on your question about the revenue per requisition growth, just keep in mind, that's a combination of both the pricing and reimbursement pressure that we're seeing, as well as the benefits of some of the test and business mix shifts. So when you think about pure pricing, the reimbursement pressure is a little bit less than 1% for the quarter. And so, how we got to that favorable revenue per acquisition overall is really being driven by favorable test and business mix shifts. Steve and Mark both mentioned gene-based and esoteric testing had – grew very nicely in the second quarter, grew in the first quarter as well. And so, some of the benefits of those additional tests on requisitions, as well as a richer test in some of the things that we are selling, has benefited that revenue per requisition calculation.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that outcome is not a coincidence. It is a consequence of our strategy, to steer a larger portion of our portfolio to where we can make more money and where we can deliver value.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Steve, a follow-up question on – just to get your market perspective. In the past, the number of tests that are offered on a menu has been, I think, a limiting factor or a critical factor for a lab to penetrate the provider segment, whether it's ambulatory or hospital. Is that still the case? And what do you think is that critical number? Do you need to have 250 tests on your menu, do you need 1,000 tests, do you need more than that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we – as one of our elements of our value that we deliver to all our clients, including integrate delivery systems in hospitals, is we have one of the broadest test menu of anyone. So, as you know, we've got the most routine and the most advanced, and we're bringing new science to the marketplace every day. We're proud of that, and we think it will continue to be a differentiator. The hospital market, the referencer (01:02:40) market, is a more concentrated marketplace. It's – there's no specific number because in addition to the test menu, it includes consideration about quality and service and reputation in the marketplace. And, yes, pricing is a consideration for that as well. So, you have to put all of those elements together to eventually really understand what happens at the end of the day of us getting reference work and more hospital business versus others. So, there's no particular number that we can see.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just what is self-pay as a percent of your revenues?
Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: About low single digits. I think it's about 2%.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ricky.
Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I think we're up on time. So I just wanted to say once again that we believe we had another good quarter. We are making solid progress executing our strategy. We appreciate your time here today and we hope you have a great day. So take care and see you in our travels.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics, First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I’d like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.  During this call we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risk and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to those described in Quest Diagnostics 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the investor relations quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website.  Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I’ll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We’ll share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in clinical trials testing. Together our two companies will create the new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug developments through clinical trials.  The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities in scale of our two organizations in an agile way with a laser like focus on serving customers.  The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicine through companion diagnostics and biomarket discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organizations through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time that JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a standalone basis.  The JV structure addresses three of our five strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data.  Second, it enables us to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital that enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. For now, both entities will continue to operator separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015.  Turning to our first quarter results, we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion. On an organic basis consolidated revenues grew almost 1%.  Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment and we are able to grow despite a harsh winter that while is somewhat less severe than a year ago was particularly difficult in the Northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence.  Before I get into our strategy update I’d like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. Through the first quarter we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis. We are encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the healthcare system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania during the quarter, and we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes.  Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the healthcare system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall costs. We actually saw this ourselves on a recent Quest Diagnostic Health Trend study. This peer review publication in diabetes care, found a significant double digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage, and no increase in states that did not.  On reimbursement we see less government pressure on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule in 2015, than we have seen in the previous two years. I’ll start with the Doc-Fix. Last week the President signed historic legislation titled the Medicare Access and CHIP Re-authorization Act to primarily reform the Medicare Physician Payment Methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourages us to make the healthcare systems smarter without dining access.  This legislation is also directionally aligned with the HHS goals announced at January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and HHS have outlined specific measurable goals and timelines for these value based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient like us.  Next, I’d like to provide a status update on the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Our industry continues to work constructively with CMS on effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago I met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rule making progress that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting we reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process.  We remain hopeful the rule making progress will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead.  We continue to execute the company’s 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment.  Now what I’d like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the Professional Laboratory Services agreements we signed last year; and third, gene based esoteric testing revenues grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than a year.  We continue to grow BRCA revenues which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie‘s ongoing public advocacy. One way we differentiate ourselves is by advocating for open access for BRCA data for patients and clinicians.  In collaboration with our French research consortium Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA share and open data share initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA and gene rotations, particularly a variance of uncertain significance to improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Inserm collaboration is an example of how we are using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides.  Last quarter we told you about some new population health, data analytics decision support tools we are developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physician, ACOs and health plans to evaluate disease states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific testing protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot our customers our now engaging with patients and healthcare professionals proactively, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health.  In addition to population and health tools we are making progress to delivering on what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insight offer providers trendy data interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content such as videos and articles specific to conditions and disease.  IntelliTest Analytics is a web based secure portal that provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data driven insights about test utilization patterns, so they can adhere to clinically appropriately testing norms.  Care360 revenue cycle management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections. In November 2012 we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on peoples’ lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was in a central part of becoming more external and customer focused. Since then we’ve made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we are not just a lab; we are more than a lab. We are a trusted partner and we provide deep clinical insights.  Our vision was the first step. Next we needed to turn it into a compelling customer facing brand, a simple consistent way to talk about Quest, who we are, the value we bring; in short, what is the Quest difference.  Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is action from insight. Our brand strategy is based on three pillars; the idea that we inspire action from the work we do, that we have limited answers or patients and healthcare providers and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea, that notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action, the action that transforms lives.  Well, as you can tell I’m excited about what our new corporate position, it means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand that gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price.  Brand is more than a logo, and we’re tag lined. To bring our band to life, we have to change the way we think and talk of what we do. Additionally, we are engaging all of our 45,000 people with the direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You will start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months.  Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past we continue to update you on the progress as we go. The third element of our strategy is to simplify against and strength our organization. We’ve been focusing on execution and building a performance oriented culture. We are very pleased to be included recently as one of the Fortune Magazine’s Worlds Most Admired Companies.  Over the past year we have introduced a number of new management tools as part of the Quest management system. We are rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month and as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with our new brand rollout, I found employees at all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead.  The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business. We continue to make good progress and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recently example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core while unlocking the value of this important business. We’ll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets and we always strive to build value for our shareholders.  And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for the year to come. We paid our dividend at the increased rate and as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays.  Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and in improving business environment. Mark. 
Mark Guinan: Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year and grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew by 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.6% versus the prior year, while revenue per acquisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions DIS revenues volumes and revenue per acquisition were all essentially flat for the quarter.  I would like to share some addition context on these underline volumes and revenue per acquisition metrics. First let me touch on the impact on the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for given geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. For the past two years we’ve experienced unusually severe winters, however in 2012 we had a mild weather, which resulted in upside to our expectations.  This year volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country and in particular the northeast. While the impact was not as severe as a year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter and we were planning on better performance. Turning to underlying revenue per acquisition, we saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter that was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable test and business mixtures.  Moving to our diagnostic solutions business which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. We enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials products and risk assessment businesses.  Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 14.6% of revenues compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. With comparable volumes essentially flat, the improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A related impacts including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues.  For the quarter adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinance in the first quarter. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year’s first quarter included after tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges which reduced reported EPS by $0.13. Let me share a few comments on special items. As you think about special items, because of their nature they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retire. A second tranche of debt was redeemed in April which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur a total pre-tax charges of nearly $115 million related to our debt refinancing.  In addition to charges our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our clinical trials business into the joint venture which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be in the similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this one time gain out of our earnings. To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012 the benefits adjusted out of earnings have been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.3% flat to a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductable requirements.  Our DSOs were 45 days, three days lower than last quarter and four days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence, continuously demonstrated by our billing operations and patient service centers teams that continue to be effectively engaged with patients and payers to ensure that we get paid for the work we do. Reported cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter; however, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would have been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago. Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deals closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. With respect to the impact of adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will be essentially neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year. And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes we will no longer report the revenues in operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will however reflect our share of the joint ventures earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earning in our other three unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize we delivered solid top and bottom line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of reported organic consolidated revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy and we’re excited to share more details on the joint venture with Quintiles when we close. Thanks for your support. Now we’d be to take any of your questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mr. Mike Cherny from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
Mike Cherny: Hi, can you hear me?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, good morning. Yes, we’re here.
Mike Cherny: I apologize for that. So a question about volume growth. It seems to be – you talked about an improvement from a market outlook perspective. Obviously weather across the board is pretty nasty this year. If I recall correctly, I think your still rolling off the comp related, some of the lower margin business that you guys decided to walk away from last year. Is there any way you could provide us with a number of terms of what you think that took away from organic volume growth, so we can try and get to a true number, particularly one that correlates with the positive market competitor you’ve had.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, well first of all your right. We are rolling off some of these businesses. In the past we haven’t given you specifics on that. Marks would you like to shed some light on sequentially our continued improvement?
Mark Guinan: So Mike, thanks for the question. We have referenced at one point 150 basis points of volume differential. Obviously we don’t want to get into the habit of every single quarter reconciling that, but directionally it’s the order of magnitude and what you might think of in terms of the impact on our volume.  We did also reference that we would annualize that at some point in the second quarter, but also to be clear, we took those actions in the second quarter, so you shouldn’t be expecting the year-over-year comp to be fully positive until the end of that quarter.  So it’s a similar level of volume as we also said, although we continue to regularly look over our portfolio and ensure that all the volume is value creating volume. That discreet set of actions we took during the second quarter of last year was kind of a one-time event and you shouldn’t expect those kind of things to happen again at any sort of regularity.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so Mike, let me just add to Mark’s comments. What we’re doing is continuing to focus our energy on parts of the market that aren’t growing and defocusing on those parts that aren’t and that’s related to our earlier remarks about what we are doing with our resources and accounts.  But the things we wanted to see grow are growing in the quarter. We did mention that we saw the highest growth rate in our gene esoteric testing business this quarter, we are happy about that. We continue to see good growth in our wellness business, our prescription drug monitoring business, Hepatitis C. All the areas that we focused on for growth are progressing nicely and as you know, I mentioned in my commentary BRCA as well.  So the focus is good. Sequentially we are seeing improvement and the momentum continues to build, so we feel good about that.
Mike Cherny: No. Thanks guys. That’s really helpful in understanding the underlying dynamics. And then just quickly on BRCA specifically, I know you called out about esoteric, which is quite strong in the quarter and BRCA is a particular driver. Is it possible at this point given that it’s been a number of quarters since you first launched that test, to give a sense of the sizing of that business roughly to at least the esoteric base and over the course of this year how important you think the growth specifically there could potentially be?
Steve Rusckowski: We’re not going to spell out the business. I mean obviously as you look at it, its magnitude relative to the overall size of the class. We don’t get into that detail and business of that size and certainly its growing. It’s one of the areas we called out previously and it continues to be a growth area along with prescription drug monitoring and certainly HCB, our special laboratory services there. So BRCA continues to provide growth that we’re not going to give any granularity at this point of sharing the actual revenues.
Mike Cherny: No, that’s fine. I’d figure I’d try anyway. Thanks guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hi Isaac
Isaac Ro: Very good morning guys, thank you. First question was just on the weather commentary you had. I was wondering if you could maybe try and ballpark the volume impact. I think I missed that, and then the second question had to do a little bit with the financial.
Steve Rusckowski: That’s great. Mark you want to give some more color. We gave you an EPS impact of relationship to last year.
Mark Guinan: Yes. So from a volume perspective and revenue, it’s probably in the area of around 150 basis points. So last year we talked about a 2% headwind due to weather. This year as I said, not quite as severe, but a fairly large differential from kind of what we would expect to be an average weather based on looking at historical patterns. 
Isaac Ro: Sure, that’s helpful, thanks. And then just in terms of market share I simply sort of my square out your commentary on volume and some of the benefits your seeing from your growth initiatives. How do you feel about your market share and then just last one was on tax rate, obviously a bit low this quarter. You had some one-timers, but how should we think about tax rate for the rest of the year?
Steve Rusckowski: We continue to feel good about where we are focused in the market and where we are focusing we are picking up share, we feel good about that. As we mentioned in the past, we are deciding in some portion of our portfolio to not participate and so in those areas obviously we’re losing some share. But overall we’re trying to manage our business and the portfolio of resources we have to get the best of earnings growth.  What you see in the quarter and we’re happy to show is that we actually reported nice operating income growth and I think it’s a good indication of our business mix and our focus on those areas of growth and how it’s driving some portion of our margin expansion which we called out in the script.  So you want to mention Mark what’s going on with tax?
Mark Guinan: So obviously periodically you can get some discreet items in your tax line and you can always anticipate those. So we did have a couple of small items actually, they we’re that large in Q1, but the direction we gave going to the year was that our tax rate will be higher than it was in 2014 and it would be more in line with historical levels and so I think that’s what your expectation should be for the balance of the year. 
Isaac Ro: Got it. Thanks so much guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks Isaac.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. I have two questions here. So first of all, now that you’ve refinanced the debt, any thoughts about buybacks and acquisitions for the remainder of the year. I think it wasn’t included in the original guidance. Do you see it at this point representing upside to numbers?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes. So I’d say obviously there was kind of cash required Ricky. I’m sure that’s why your tying it to what are the implications for buybacks and I think at this point the guidance we gave is consistent, which is you shouldn’t assume any significant reduction in shares outstanding based on repurchases we committed to targeting to insure there is no dilution from the share account, but not any significant buyback to reduce shares.  Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A and we’ve also said that if there was not some value creative M&A that we can identify that we will do more share repurchases.  So I don’t want to completely rule out share repurchases, but at this point as part of our strategy we’re continuing to look and we’d like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck in, hold in type businesses we’ve done in the past and that would probably be our priority for cash in the balance of the year. But should we find that there’s nothing that’s executable, certainly we would use that cash for more share repurchases.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then one follow-up question on ACH, because obviously we are seeing this kind of like more and more lines joining the exchanges, but I think we are still not quite seeing that kind of like pull through on the volume side. Could you share with us your thoughts? What do you think is kind of like causing it? Is it that this population is consuming healthcare through kind of like hospital systems router the ambulatory space? Is it that you think that they don’t still know how to utilize healthcare and we’re going to see the opportunity kind of like later in the year. I mean any insight would be very helpful there.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, like you and everyone else in this market was trying to digest, the resorting if you will for the system and as we mentioned in our commentary, we are seeing an increase in Medicaid volumes, so that’s for sure and we see that.  As far as the rest, it’s hard to understand where people have come from, went to and how they are entering the healthcare system. So we have seen like you some of the volume reports coming out of some hospitals, not all. Its mixed views on that, so we are still trying to understand how this will all sort out with you. But again, we’re starting to see the impact of more lives in the system. We’re hopeful.  From the beginning of ACA we said we believe that the Affordable Care Act should be net positive for the industry and for us. We believe more people in insurance is a good thing. The diabetes studies that we showed shows that by having people with insurance it can have a positive impact on population health and we think that’s a good example of how more people in the system will serve the industry well, but also us as we go forward, so we’re hopeful.
Ricky Goldwasser: So then just – last one, because you mentioned the population health. You highlighted the pilot that you’re doing with some physician offices on your population health tool. Should we think about – kind of how should we think about that business model? Should we think about it as a potentially longer term revenue opportunity or is it just kind of like needed aid value to create stickiness with the physician and potentially connect also with the hospital provider space.
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, we’re thinking of both actually and we haven’t totally sorted it out, how this might work in terms of the business model. Clearly where we could show more value with accounts, we believe that does offer value in terms of our business, but secondly as we provide more and more value to integrated delivery systems and those organizations that are managing populations, we do have valuable assets here, information assets and this application we think is actually very valuable in terms of managing that population and we’re thinking our way through. May there be an opportunity for us actually to have a revenue business model for this, but we haven’t concluded on that yet.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ma’am. The next question is from Ms. Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning Lisa.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you just maybe two things around the new JV. First off, I think that Steve I heard you say that clinical trial testing was about 2% in 2014. So should we think about that as being a 50 basis point headwind for the back half of this year? It sounds like the volume actually won’t go through your volume, but will come from a below the line items for the JV.
Steve Rusckowski: Right. Mark, why don’t you walk through how this will get sorted out on a go forward basis?
Mark Guinan: Yes, that’s correct. Depending on the timing, if you want to call it a headwind, it will be an adjustment, so obviously we won’t be the controlling interest as the minority owner. We have a fair amount of involvement in the JV; we have a number of our senior leaders who are involved with clinical trials moving into that business; we’ve got an executive we talked about in the past. John Heins [ph] who is actually going to be sitting on the board and involved in this JV, so while for accounting purposes we are no longer going to be recording it as a revenue and we’re no longer going to be reporting the income on the operating margin line.  It’s not as if we’re completely distancing ourselves from the clinical trials business. In fact through the partnership we’re looking to drive even more in this relationship as we referenced in the earlier companion diagnostics and then potentially using our data for clinical trial enrollment as well.  So yes, in terms of engineering, it will be a headwind on revenue, but from an earnings standpoint, we’re really just in 2015 moving it from one line to the other and then most importantly we believe it’s going to be significantly accretive to what we would have done otherwise with clinical trials in 2016 and beyond.
Lisa Gill: So Mark, the way that I’m trying to think about it just from a modeling perspective and your guidance today of reiteration of your revenue expectations for 2015 and just given your comments around the weather in the first quarter, I’m just trying to square that up with how to think about the next three quarters and your expectations around both volumes as well as revenue growth and did you see something that you feel confident to maintain that number, because if I remember correctly, you gave that guidance before you announced the Quintiles JV?
Mark Guinan: Right, so Lisa my apologies, let me make sure I’m clear. So despite whether we still believe the 2% to 3% top line guidance is attainable; however, as I said in my prepared remarks, I will be adjusting that for the JV once I know the timing. So we will be reducing that 2% to 3% revenue growth guidance impacted by the JV, nothing related to weather.
Lisa Gill: Okay great. And then just Mark, my second follow-up question is also for you. It’s just around SG&A in the quarter and where you are on the cost saving initiatives. The SG&A came in a little bit higher than we anticipated, but your gross profits are a little bit higher. I’m just wondering around the timing aspect of that again. How do we think about the cost savings initiatives coming in over the next year or so?
Mark Guinan: Sure. So again, I don’t look at any one specific model, so not sure why we may have been different than what you were expecting, but I can talk about SG&A. Obviously Invigorate contributes to build our cost of sales as well as SG&A. We continue to make progress on Invigorate.  If you look quarter-to-quarter, SG&A was fairly flat in dollar terms. We do have that headwind every year at the beginning of the year from bad debt, so we did get about 30 basis points of increase from bad debt. That is typical cycle of bad debt at the beginning of the year. It tends to be higher than the end of the year, so we are very comfortable with managing of SG&A. You can see that we’ve leveraged it significantly versus last year and as part of our Invigorate program we expect to continue the leverage there.
Lisa Gill: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ma’am. The next question is from Mr. A.J. Rice from UBS. Sir, your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning A.J. You there?
Operator: Mr. Rice, your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: A.J. are you on mute.
Operator: It looks like we lost Mr. A.J. Rice, but next question comes from Mr. Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.
Bryan Brokmeier: Hi, good morning. Did you say that the organics volume was flat and is that excluding any business that you’re walking away from or is that just M&A?
Steve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take it?
Mark Guinan: Yes, so I didn’t make any adjustment before. As we talked about the business we sort of walked away from. That is an actual number, so we were just talking our results and we’re adjusting for M&A to get to that figure.
Steve Rusckowski: So the walk aways we talked about in the past are not adjusted out of that. So that would be based on the earlier comments of lift if you want to look at that.
Mark Guinan: Yes, we would have shown growth and I adjusted for that.
Bryan Brokmeier: Okay, and NIPT is another large market that you’re currently participating in for a partnership. Can you provide any color on when you’re planning to launch your own test?
Steve Rusckowski: Well, first of all its going well. So as I mentioned earlier, we’re quite pleased with our growth rate in advanced and esoteric testing and our non-evasive testing is – pre natal testing is going quite well, so we’re hopeful about that. We continue to work through our own test as you say. We haven’t announced a specific data on that, but we’re making very good progress.
Bryan Brokmeier: Okay, thank a lot.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.
Dana Nentin: Hi, good morning. Its Dana Nentin in for Darren.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey Dana.
Dana Nentin : Hey. So just going back to your DSOs being down through your four days from last year, I was wondering if you could provide any color there as it relates to the [inaudible] payment recoveries and I guess if not can you update us on the status of those non-payments?
Mark Guinan: Yes, it’s not related in any way to that. Largely it points to UMass, the acquisition of that business. Last year as we were transitioning the billing system from them to us there was some complexity in that and it slowed some collections down a bit and inflated our receivables, I’d say relative to what they would have been otherwise last year. So now that we’ve gotten that behind us, I’d say that’s probably the biggest probably year-over-year. So it’s really nothing at all related to molecular.
Dana Nentin : Okay. And can you update us on the size of those non-payments?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, we’re making progress. We’re judiciously going after our payments for what we do. We’re working with all the health plans to do that and I could share with you that if you did that we are progressing through doggedly working through test by test, payer by payer to make sure we get paid for the good work we provide, so you feel like we’re making progress.
Mark Guinan: But I do want to clarify, because if we’ve taken this question a number of times in the past and consistently given our response, we are not expecting any sort of significant windfall. While certainly this is a headwind and I think you’ve heard from maybe other people in the laboratory area about significant reductions in payments based on some of the changes, whether its CBT 2013 or now CBT 2015 or other changes in the reimbursement requirement.  So while there’s certainly been a headwind, it’s not material to our performance this year and it should not be something that you expect at some point we’re going to come back and say, hey, we solved a bunch of issues and here’s a big good bag.
Dana Nentin : Okay great, that’s helpful. Thanks.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.
Robert Willoughby: Hi Steve and Mark. Your approaching a year of ownership now of solicitors. Can you speak to retention rates of the business there, what synergies have been captured, what’s left on the table there?
Steve Rusckowski: Yes, so we’re making excellent progress with the inspiration of solicitors. What we did in that geography is to really combine both of our businesses together and so we’re integrating operations, we’re integrating our G&A functions, some portion of the improvement you see in our SG&A. This quarter is related to that good work we’re doing there.  We also have integrated the sales force. As you know when you buy any organization, we had planned on some attrition related to clients that we know that would not move over to us and have planned that in our model and we’re tracking to make sure that we did have it planned. So we feel good about the progress that we made and we feel good about what we’re delivering in terms of creating value for our shareholders. 
Robert Willoughby: Okay, thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma’am your line is open.
Amanda Murphy: Hi, good morning guys. I guess just a couple of follow-ups on the reimbursement side. So you mentioned the growth on the esoteric front and BRCA specifically, but just curious as you think forward. Obviously there is a lot of opportunity, particularly in sequencing based diagnostics. What’s your view on the reimbursement environment there specifically? I know there has been some work to establish some coding there, so curious just thinking about that this year and then longer term?
Steve Rusckowski: We deliver a lot of value. As you know the average market price has come down over the last year and a half, two years. We believe where we are right now is supporting the plan we have going forward. We feel good about that and we’ll continue to as we’ve done with everything in our business; continue to have the data that justifies that we’re putting a lot of value here and we need to make sure we get back in our reimbursement, the value it delivers.  So we’re going to be careful before we do anything. In terms of pricing changes we believe that defending and continuing to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace is important for us. We think it’s important for the industry to continue to defend and get our value back for the marketplace. There’s a great value we deliver and that’s position we continue to take going forward.  So Mark, anything you’d like to add?
Mark Guinan: Yes, Amanda, I’m sure as you fully appreciate, especially in the gene based area, reimbursement is related also to your offering. It’s not an independent decision. So look at our onc [ph] advantage product and the fact that we have a panel of actionable genes, 34 actionable genes and as we engage with the payers, I think the response is the dialog with our medical professionals and so on is you know fairly positive because of the fact that we are moving forward with the limited panel that is actually all around the action.  So as Steve talked about earlier, data brings insights, insights to drive actions and I think the payers are much more willing to pay for things, where clearly there is a path towards actions. So again, not commenting on anybody else’s offerings, it’s not the same for the all of it. Certainly the choices we make around our product offerings and the size of the panels and the action ability of those panels also influences our ability to get paid. 
Amanda Murphy: And one follow-up to that, is there any way that you can give as an idea as how big that business is for you now. Obviously esoteric encompasses quite a lot, but if you think about just sequencing, I guess as a bucket how big that is and how much of your growth on esoteric is coming from that side of the world. I know you mentioned BRAC again, but...
Steve Rusckowski: Mark and Dan should talk a little bit about how we breakup things in our 10-K. 
Mark Guinan: Amanda we break out the gene based and esoteric in the 10-K we shared on the supplemental analysis on the website. So overall gene based esoteric and Anatomic Pathology is about $2.5 billion business, but in terms of specifics sub-segments and different cuts of the data at the level of granularity you are looking for, we haven’t share that at this point. 
Amanda Murphy: Okay, thanks guys. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. 
Nicholas Jansen: Yes, Mark this one is for you on free cash flow. I think the guidance this year is $550 million, but that certainly excludes some things like the debt restructuring charges and some of the project Invigorate 2.0 charges. So I’m just trying to get a sense of actually how much true free cash flow is available this year. I know you have a dividend payment, I know you guidance includes kind of 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A. So maybe just walk me through the cash flow dynamics. 
Mark Guinan: The only thing that I’m excluding is the debt refinancing, so I’m not adjusting for any of the Invigorate expenses. So as we talked about it was $78 million in the quarter. We talked about the fact that we’d have a somewhat similar charge in the second quarter. So that should guide you. I mean at the end of the day, we are expecting somewhere a little less that $100 million of expense from the refinancing.  So the $550 million less that will be kind of I guess the free cash flow number that you are looking for that takes the new account to cash expenditures for other adjustments. And again, we have some positive guys that we adjust out, but actually they are cash positive as well. So when you net all those out, normally we don’t many adjustments, but just given the size and I guess the unusual nature of the debt refinancing, I decided to adjust that just to make the year over year comparison what I thought was a little more meaningful and comparable. 
Nicholas Jansen: Okay, that’s helpful. And then regarding the $0.08 weather headwind. I’m just trying to reconcile that relative to what you reported. So I guess on the previous conference call you talked about having 1Q earnings only slightly better than 2Q to 4Q. If we were added $0.08 back to the $1.05 that would be meaningfully better than slightly. So I’m just trying to reconcile kind of the quarter relative to your internal expectations that you gave back in January and kind of how that proceeds to the guidance that was reiterated today. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you for the question. Obviously when we spoke to you in January we hadn’t incurred the February weather, but we had incurred some January weather. So we were trying at that point with the knowledge that we had at that point, we just wanted to make sure that people didn’t get overly exuberant about the potential of the first quarter given the easy compare with the weather in 2014.  So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably formed a little more stronger than we expected in the first quarter adjusting for the weather, so had the weather not been there, it would have been a really, really strong quarter. There is various reasons for that. However I’ll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we are very confident in and whatever the performance in the first quarter, you just assume that guidance is reasonable and that’s where we are going to land. 
Nicholas Jansen: Thanks for the clarification. 
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open, you may proceed. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning. 
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Just a quick question for you on the hospital side. So I know we’ve talked about in the past how the opportunity is for these hospitals to look to outsource their labs. We are hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital based labs and also narrow network strategies specifically you know Anthem, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. So are we seeing more of that or is the pressure accelerating in the hospitals that you are starting to see more conversations with hospital CEOs. 
Steve Rusckowski: As I mentioned in the past Brian, the discussions we’re having and the opportunity list that we have and that we are working is larger than we ever anticipated. Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategies as part of their shortlist were encouraged by all that.  The dynamic you mentioned we think is a very positive dynamic. As we’ve talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this market place and therefore in terms of value we are in the strongest of the choices people have.  And yes payers are now starting to look at every tightening their network further, but wide variation in prices from what we have here versus hospital outreach are notable and yes, it’s from the payers, but I also mentioned two other dimensions to that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their healthcare costs and seeing wide variations, so they are starting to ask questions. And most importantly consumers with a higher co-pay in deducible have now started to ask questions. Why would their bills go up, just because physicians are now working for integrated Delivery Systems verses when those physicians used to send the work to independent laboratories like ourselves.  So all this is coming together and in a good way. Most hospitals we talked to realize with payment models moving away from fee for service to population health and bundle payment models that no longer is an incentive to – or they are no longer incentives to drive volume and activity, but look at how they deliver the best quarter to healthcare with the lowest possible cost, that’s what we saw at the University of Massachusetts.  And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice-cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. Therefore they are taking to us and thinking about what their options should be.  So it’s coming together nicely. We actually applaud what’s happening with Anthem. We think it’s a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there is a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussions started and move this at an accelerated pace. 
Brian Tanquilut: Got it. Thanks Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is open. You may proceed. 
David Clair: Yes, good morning everybody. So I’m just curious, given the timing of the PAMA final rule, it sounds like they are going to miss the initial June proposed rule deadline. So how would you handicap the odds of the clinical lab fee schedule reprising happening by 2017?
Steve Rusckowski: Well David, I’ll leave the odds giving to Las Vegas. Hard to handicap CMS, hard to handicap anything that happens in Washington. As I mentioned, we were down there last month; we being myself and some members of our industry. We had a very good conversation. Its complex and they are working through all that complexity. With all the different entities that we have to give them their data, all the different codes they have to look through, all the different tax IDs and so they are digesting all of that.  So with all that said, it is still their goal and that’s how they say it, still their goal to have the rule making out in 2015 for collection in the ’16 for ’17 a refresh to the clinical lab fee schedule. So that’s the gold they are still working at. 
David Clair: Okay. Thank you and then I was wondering was the debt refinance included in your original EPS guidance and if it wasn’t, what’s the offset to the interest savings that we are going to see in the year. 
Mark Guinan: And so, I’m sure as you appreciate when put guidance together you got a number of items to consider and various ranges I know for modeling purposes, you always need a discreet entry, but we are considering ranges of potential outcomes and inputs. So certainly we had a reasonable expectation we might do the debt refinancing, we didn’t know exactly the timing, we didn’t know exactly what the new interest rate might be and hence the interest savings.  So at this point since I reaffirmed guidance and EPS, assume that the interest savings is in there and I can’t really call out an offset, because we still have $0.15 of range within the guidance. So its within the parameters of all the different contributors to how the EPS was driven and so I couldn’t tell you exactly what the offset was, because there isn’t necessarily, because we are still within a range that’s quire broad. 
David Clair: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Jack Meehan from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hi Jack.
Jack Meehan: Hi, good morning guys. I want to sort of just ask about the new BRAC data sharing initiative you announced earlier this week and just the background, how it came together. And then timing wise, just curious why now? Obviously you’ve been on the market 18 months and I think there is a lot of differing thoughts on the merits of the U.S. So just in terms of it being a metric, what are you seeing on the market? 
Steve Rusckowski: First of all we responded quickly to the opportunity to enter the BRCA market. After the Supreme Court ruling, we entered the market about four months afterwards. So we entered into the market. And as we approach all businesses Jack, we continue to look at ways that we can get better at what we do. So we’ve been improving our offering in terms of our capabilities, of our sales force, capabilities of our generic counselor, capabilities of the quality of our reporting and the look and feel of our interactive insights as I talked about it in my remarks.  But also we are looking at how do we get the actually results to be of higher quality and we only have so much data. We believe it would be the right thing to do, to take our data, combine it with other people’s data. The inserm being the French Institute for Health has 16 labs that report their data gain.  We are also happening to have LabCorp participate in this. So we are going to put in both of data that’s into Inserm and we believe that this is just the beginning, there will be others to follow.  In the outcome of this, we believe it will be an outcome of the curation and also the analytics around that data to produce better sensitivity and specificity around the testing for BRAC and we think that’s a good thing for the industry and a good thing for us. So we think this is the next step of improving and delivering a great solution to the market place at a better way.  We will continue to differentiate ourselves and everything I just described, how we sell it, how we support it, how we present it and how we explain it’s in our solution to the market place which we think will allow us to continue to differentiate ourselves versus the other options that our customers have. So we think its progress in the right direction. 
Jack Meehan: Yes, got it. And then just maybe off that; is there a way to gauge a sense for just collectively the contribution in terms of volumes and just you know where you think it needs to be in order to have similar VUS rates and if that’s a good metric to consider?
Mark Guinan: So we are not going to see any sort of detail on the volumes that are contributed. In the French the institute has been collecting data for 10 years. So there is a fair amount of data. Obviously you’ve got us and LabCorp who have decided it’s in the best interest of patients to contribute, come out to better data information. We are going to compete on other aspects of our product offering than anything around the science.  And again back to the VUS, this is not about VUS. This is really about insuring we have the best ability to provide information to patients and therefore we won’t get into sort of the medical comparisons or anything like that; that’s not why we are doing this. We are not doing this for competitive reasons. We are doing this because it’s in the best interest of patients. 
Jack Meehan: Got it and if I can squeeze in one more maybe just for Mark, curious if you are seeing anything on the deductable side and any changes to start the year in terms of the prevalence of high deductible health plans. 
A - Steve Rusckowski: I mean it’s still early for us to know whether there has been a large hit. I mean obviously we’ve built into our assumptions that continued trend towards more high deductable plans for a reported based provider insurance. We did have the usual first quarter lift in bad debts like our efforts in some of it and so forth, so nothing I can share of detail at this point. 
Jack Meehan: Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you and our last question is from Mr. A.J. Rice. Sir you line is open you may proceed. 
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody, sorry about earlier. Just two quick areas of question; first on the upcoming JV with Quintiles, is it generally in the ballpark to think of the operating margins. Thank you that you gave us to revenues. The operating margins on the clinical trial business you are contributing are somewhere close to the corporate average and then as you think about the JV on an ongoing basis, will there be either cash commitments on your part going forward after the JV setup or will you be taking – have opportunities to take cash out. What are the cash flow implications of the JV? 
Mark Guinan: Right so, A.J. I won’t get into the specifics, but the clinical trials businesses is not materially different from its order of magnitude; its margin is similar the overall enterprise. Obviously you get a lot more granularity on that when you start seeing the changes in our equity earnings line going forward.  In terms of cash, there is just some initial cash from a working capital standpoint that’s not significant, because we are going to continue to kind of wean down the receivables of our business and keep that as opposed to contributing that to the venture. So at the end of the day that’s going to about a wash.  We have an annual – and it’s part of the contract. We have an annual ability to take out cash dividend as will Quintiles as well. So we are expecting to get cash contributions out of the JV going forward. And in terms of any sort of future cash needs, it’s part of this agreement. We have the ability to both, to contribute cash if you want to do more M&A through the partnerships or there some other investment opportunity that going forward agrees make sense. There is an ability to bring cash into the entity. So we feel it’s pretty flexible in terms of cash, but we certainly are expecting to get our fair share of cash out of this entity going forward as well. 
A.J. Rice: Okay and then maybe just one other follow-up. I think you had said this before, and I think it’s my sense of the industry overall, but when you think about the larger contracts with payers and others, that this is a relatively benign year that doesn’t have a lot of re-contracting activity, but I just wanted to put that out there and confirm that that is indeed the cash, if it’s true. 
Mark Guinan: So independent of whether we had a lot of re-contracting. What we have said is that the pricing pressure, the price erosion in 2015 is to be more similar to ’14 and in ’14 it was less than a 100 basis points and I’m not going to get into the specifics of how close is it going to be ’14, but more like ’14 and I also said that as part of the Investor Day that I would expect ’16 and ’17 to also be more like ’14. 
A.J. Rice: Okay, all right, thanks a lot. 
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. 
Dan Haemmerle: Okay, no further questions. Thanks again for joining the call today. As you can see, we are making good progress executing our strategy. We are excited about the clinical trials opportunity. We appreciate your support and you have a great day. Thank you very much.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 conference call. At the request of the Company this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you. Good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risk and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to those described in Quest Diagnostics 2013 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the investor relations quarterly update section of our website at www.QuestDiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results, supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I will provide you with highlights of the quarter. We will share industry trends and also we will review our progress that we are making executing on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. We continue to make progress on our path forward delivering solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, revenues grew 7% to $1.9 billion, adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.08 and cash from operations was strong at $303 million. For the full-year 2014, revenues grew 4% to $7.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2.5% to $4.10 a share and we generated $938 million in cash. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment. That combined with our ability to generate substantial and predictable cash flow has enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.38 a share. This is the fourth time we have raised the dividend since 2011. Before I get into our performance, I would like to talk about industry dynamics, specifically utilization, reimbursement and regulation. To start with in utilization, we continued to see signs of modest increase in utilization. We are encouraged by the progress on exchange enrollment as the result of the Affordable Care Act. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on what we are calling a same provider basis. On reimbursement, we will see less government pressure on the clinical lab fee schedule in 2015 than we have seen in the previous 2 years. At this time our industry is focused on effectively implementing the Doc Fix legislation also known as Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the clinical lab fee schedule. Our industry trade association, the American Clinical Lab Association, ACLA, continues to work closely with the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on the rulemaking process. We are hopeful the rulemaking process will be defined in 2015 and will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. The market view that will be used to update the fee schedule should include participants from the entire market including large and small independent commercial labs, boutique labs as well as hospitals. The current timetable calls for data to be collected from the market participants in 2016 and any revisions to the fee schedule would therefore go in place no sooner than 2017. We will continue to update you on the progress as we know more in the coming year. Another important issue facing the industry is the FDA's proposal to extend regulatory oversight to laboratory developed tests. The American Clinical Lab Association is actively opposing the FDA's proposal and has engaged 2 highly respected experts in constitutional law in the administrative procedure, Laurence Tribe From Harvard Law School and Paul Clement, the former Solicitor General of the United States. The FDA's proposal is regulatory overreach at its worst and is bad for patients and the healthcare industry. For that reason, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other leading healthcare providers have urged the FDA to withdraw its proposal. Now for an update on our performance. We continue to improve on our ability to execute the Company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Let's start with our highest priority, growth, and reviewing our progress. In 2014 we executed our strategy and restored growth. First, we improved our sales effectiveness on how we call on the market. As you have heard me say before, our go-to-market team is better led, better managed, better staffed, better trained, better equipped, better motivated compared to 2 years ago. We have seen continued improvement on our underlying revenue trends this year. In the fourth quarter, organic revenues grew 60 basis points versus last year. This is the first quarter of organic revenue growth since I joined the Company in May of 2012. Second, our professional lab services business has announced and implemented 6 new relationships in 2014 which are on track to deliver $40 million in annualized revenues. The most recent contract was finalized in the fourth quarter. Third, part of our improving performance is a result of our strategy to focus on esoteric testing through our clinical franchises. We saw sequential improvement in gene based and esoteric testing for the third consecutive quarter. Some specific tests that are growing faster are our BRCAdvantage breast cancer testing, noninvasive prenatal testing, and hepatitis C. I am also proud of a growing list of strategic partnerships with healthcare leaders that include Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of California San Francisco. In addition, we have continued to see notable growth in the quarter in prescription drug monitoring, wellness and infectious disease franchises. We are also making progress on some of the longer term goals to realize the promise of precision medicine and the value of our information assets. During Investor Day, we spoke about our new capabilities we are developing that leverage our connectivity solutions and build on Quest's strong history of healthcare IT innovation. We are developing tools that focus on population health as well as improving provider and patient engagement. I would like to say a few words about each of these. First in regards to population health, our Quest analytical tools will help health plans, ACOs, health systems and care coordinators identify clinical risk, target and close gaps in care, review performance from our clinical performance scorecard tools, monitor quality metrics and query patient test information using a new self-service capability that provides on-demand access to their patient data. We have actually seen strong interest in these tools from our customers and you will hear more about them over the course of 2015. In addition to population health tools, we are making progress delivering what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insights for providers deliver trended data, interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content such as videos and articles specific to specific conditions and diseases. In the back half of 2014, we launched pilots with providers in women's health and prescription drug monitoring. And then finally, about 1.3 million patients have engaged with our new MyQuest patient application which lets them access and control their own health information. The value of our information assets reaches well beyond our providers and patients. A good example of this is the recent commercial expansion of our relationship with the Centers for Disease Control to improve the surveillance of hepatitis C. This demonstrates the value of not just our data but also our diagnostic insights in helping to manage significant public health issues. The CDC relationship builds on the vision we established just 2 years ago that speaks to the impact we can have on people's lives. Our vision is to empower better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was in a central part of becoming more external and customer focused and over the past 2 years we have made tremendous progress bringing that vision to life. We are more than a lab. We are a diagnostic information services company and a trusted partner. Finally, our strategy calls for a 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. During the past year, we closed 3 acquisitions Solstas, Steward and Summit. Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. The Invigorate program delivered significant cost savings. Our original 2011 savings target was $500 million. We raised it to $600 million at our 2012 Investor Day and I'm pleased to say we finished 2014 at more than $700 million in run rate savings. We are well underway with the planning of the next phase of Invigorate which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we will continue to update you on our progress. Well beyond cost excellence, our efforts to drive operational excellence has always focused on quality and building a superior customer experience. This is a fundamental principle of quality improvement. We track actually 150 medical quality and service metrics. We continue to make progress broadly on many of those metrics. In particular, we delivered 6 Sigma quality on our specimen delivery metric. We have achieved record availability for our order entry results and reporting application called Care360, which puts us at world-class service levels and we have reduced the time it takes us to install EMR interfaces. We are improving service levels while also building a more efficient operation. Our progress on service levels are actually a testament to the commitment of 45,000 employees who help us deliver excellent service each and every day. They really are the Quest difference. As you can see, we have made strong progress restoring growth and driving operational excellence. A key driver of this has been our third strategy, building a stronger organization to improve our performance. We now have a stronger team and a more simplified organization than last year. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on the core business. We continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets and we are always striving to build value for our shareholders. Finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We returned the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2014. We just raised our dividend 15%. This is the fourth increase in 3 years and in the quarter, we paid down debt and repurchased shares consistent with our commitment earlier this year. Now Mark will provide you an overview of our fourth-quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook which is based upon our strengthening operational performance and improving business environment. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 8.8% versus the prior year while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by 1.5%. For Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, acquisitions contributed more than 7% to revenues. Acquisitions added nearly 9% to volume and reduced revenues per requisition by approximately 1.5%. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition were all essentially flat for the quarter. I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, as you know, earlier this year we took some actions and trimmed portions of our customer portfolio. Adjusting for these actions, underlying organic volume performance would have improved by approximately 1.5%. Second, related to underlying revenue per requisition, the reimbursement pressure in the quarter of less than 50 basis points was offset by favorable tests and business mix. Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 8.1% compared to the prior year with our clinical trials and risk assessment businesses driving the growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $283 million or 15% of revenues compared to $282 million or 16.1% a year ago. The decline as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to lower initial margins from recent acquisitions and the impact of our management incentive compensation. As Steve mentioned, we continued to make very good progress on our Invigorate initiative and delivered more than $200 million in realized savings during 2014 achieving our goal of approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year. As we look forward, we have established a goal of $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017, an additional $600 million over the $700 million we exited with in 2014. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was 5% better than a year ago. The Company adjusted out a net benefit of $27 million in the quarter. The net benefit related to a favorable resolution of tax contingencies which was partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. The net benefit contributes $0.18 per diluted share to our reported earnings of $1.26 for the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13.7%. Last year's fourth quarter reported operating income from continuing operations was reduced by $12 million related to restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a reduction in reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 0.8% and reported EPS by $0.06. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, 20 basis points better than Q3 2014 but 10 basis points higher than a year ago. Our DSOs were 48 days, 2 days higher than last quarter with the increase partially attributed to mix of business for our employer solutions, wellness and healthcare IT businesses which tend to have longer payment terms. In the quarter, as previously mentioned, a favorable resolution of tax contingencies along with certain R&D tax credits contributed to our lower tax rate for the year. Looking ahead to 2015, we would expect our tax rate to be more similar to the 2013 rate. Cash from operations was $303 million in the quarter compared to $210 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2013, cash from operations was negatively impacted by the tax payment related to the gain on the sale of ibrutinib. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter compared to $76 million a year ago. The increase in capital spending in the quarter reflects investments to support our Invigorate program, the opening of the new laboratory in Marlborough and continued investments to integrate our recent acquisitions. For the year, capital expenditures were $308 million, in line with our guidance of approximately $300 million. During the quarter we continued to return value to shareholders through our dividend and our repurchase of $50 million worth of our common shares at an average price of $64.44. We also made progress on our debt repayment commitments by reducing our debt by more than $116 million in the quarter. I would now like to review a few of the considerations underpinning our 2015 guidance. Starting with revenues, we have shared that reimbursement pressure should be moderate between 2015 and 2017 based on our assumptions and we expect our reimbursement experience to be more like what we experienced in 2014 than what we saw in 2013. Our most recent acquisitions, Solstas, Summit and Steward, which contributed more to 7% to DIS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014, will anniversary during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2015. At this point we have not included the benefit of additional acquisitions in our guidance for 2015. As you consider expenses, we have established a goal of $600 million in additional run rate savings as we exit 2017 and we are modeling approximately $175 million in realized savings in 2015 related to Invigorate. We are estimating that one-time charges this year related to Invigorate will be in the range of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We have provided additional detail on the breakdown of these charges in our 8-K filed earlier this morning. We estimate up to $300 million in investments over the next 3 years. As we further develop our course of action for the program in 2016 and 2017, we will provide more detail. With respect to cycling your models first off, while weather may be a benefit in Q1 compared to a year ago, the snow in the Northeast over the past few days has negatively impacted our business. Therefore we do not expect to see a complete rebound from last year's harsh winter. Additionally, we expect the benefit of Invigorate and acquisition synergies to build and contribute more to the bottom line as we progress through the year. As a result of these considerations, we expect to see a relatively steady growth rate quarter by quarter with only a slightly higher rate in EPS growth in Q1 than what you would see in Q2 through Q4. Lastly, as we shared at our Investor Day in November, we are moving guidance to cash EPS or adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization. As described at our Investor Day, we are making this change based on feedback and interest from many investors to provide a comparable reporting presentation to many healthcare companies and importantly, this changes in no way impacts the criteria we utilize to analyze potential acquisitions. With that backdrop, let me frame our thought process on sending our guidance in this year of transition. We started with 2014 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10. We built our guidance with a framework that would deliver approximately a 6% to 10% improvement in performance on our 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure. We then added in the anticipated impact of amortization based on our current amortization schedules. The amortization for 2015 is estimated to be slightly lower than what it was in 2014. Based on that math and our view of the business, we are now sharing a guidance range for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization of $4.70 to $4.85. Given our strategy to acquire 1% to 2% in growth each year and the continued need to pay down some debt, you should not anticipate share buybacks beyond the level to meet our majority of free cash flow commitment and the need to prevent any dilution. We also continue to evaluate our portfolio so should we monetize any significant assets, this could change. Finally on cash from operations, please note the forecasted reduction versus 2014 despite an anticipated increase in operating income is driven primarily by 2 factors. First, given the way the calendar falls out, we have an extra payroll cycle in 2015. This additional payroll cycle is not material to our cash liquidity. The second driver is the payout of accrued management compensation which was depressed in 2014. Based on these considerations, we expect full-year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million, and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we reported organic revenue growth as we continue to build momentum. We have made good progress executing on our strategy. As a result, we have met our commitments for 2014, raised our dividend once again and have provided guidance for 2015 that shows continued improvement. We thank you for joining us this morning and we would be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. 
David Clair: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, David. 
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Dave.
David Clair: So first question from me, you mentioned looking at non-core assets during your commentary. Can you give us any details on areas that you would potentially be interested in?
Steve Rusckowski: Sure. Well, in 2012, we laid out those businesses that were core and those things we would consider our options for. One of those categories were our drug assets. We actually monetized one of those as you will recall with ibrutinib. We still have one remaining. That is something we would consider. And then also we talked about our products business, Celera products is a product line if you will that we talked about. So those are 2 that we would consider our options for.
David Clair: If the FDA LDT regulations go through, do you have any estimates in terms of what it might cost you guys and is any of that built into estimates for 2015?
Steve Rusckowski: No, first of all, we don't believe it should go through. We believe it is not good regulation. We already have regulation with CLIA. If we need to do a better job with quality and regulatory approvals, then we should improve CLIA. In that regard, the FDA has heard some of the feedback through their panels, is reviewing what we have been talking about. So we will see where this evolves but we have no estimate of what it would cost us at this point if in fact it were to go through.
David Clair: Thanks. Congratulations on a nice quarter.
Operator: Our next question or comment is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Speaker: Hi. This is actually (inaudible) in for Lisa. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, there. Good morning. 
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Gavin [ph]. 
Unidentified Speaker: Good morning. I just wanted to get some more color on your expectations for market growth. I think you said at Investor Day that you thought the market would be growing 2% to 3% and that you would be growing faster than the market because you are targeting prior growth areas. Can you just walk me through what you are expecting for market growth in 2015?
Steve Rusckowski: What we said is that we believe the market - when we do our models - this is mid- to long-term market growth - would grow 2% to 3% and this is for the independent commercial lab market so it excludes commercial outreach businesses from hospitals. In that number we have anticipated growth in population, we have anticipated growth in insured lives, gradual build in lives that have insurance from the Affordable Care Act. We have also considered the advancements of what we do is also going to provide some growth in the marketplace. So that is what we believe the growth to be. We also shared in the fall that we said back to years ago what we will do is show gradual improvement in our organic revenues. We needed to first stop the decline. We needed to flatten out and what you've seen in the back half is that actually we do believe we have underlying organic growth. In this quarter we actually did show organic revenue growth. So we are progressing with our improvement step-by-step. We need to next grow with the market and then finally start growing faster than the market gaining share. So that is the progress we are making. What we laid out today for guidance for 2015 is consistent with that view.
Unidentified Speaker: And then just touching on core business and some of the business that you walked away from this year when you saw the improvement in volumes in the quarter, is there any expectation to exit other business lines or customers in 2015 or do you feel like you have lapped that trend?
Mark Guinan: There always could be exceptions. Obviously we are continuously evaluating our portfolio of business relationships. But as we said, that was kind of a one-time exercise to look across the broad portfolio and you should not expect that kind of volume impact certainly going forward into the future. So yes, we will continue to look at every relationship, make sure that they all make sense but I think you would consider what we did in the second quarter somewhat extraordinary and not a normal procedure that you should continue to see going forward.
Unidentified Speaker: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Mark Guinan: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Bill Bonello: Hey. Great. Good morning, guys. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey. Good morning, Bill.
Bill Bonello: I have a question I guess on sort of operating leverage here. Essentially I am struggling to understand maybe why you haven't been showing more leverage on the income statement. It seems like pricing pressure was actually pretty moderate, the cost savings you are recording are huge. I guess I'm just wondering A, what we are missing in terms of offsetting factors? And then two, what changes that you start to show EPS growth significantly outpacing revenue growth in 2015?
Mark Guinan: So a couple of things, Bill. In 2014, we talked about the fact that we had 3 things that really were impacting our ability to leverage Invigorate. One was price which was less severe than 2013 but was still there. The second one is our annual wage inflation and then the third piece was this management comp issue which really is hopefully a one-time year-over-year bad guy compare because of the underperformance in 2013. So when you add all those pieces up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, those certainly were a headwind to leveraging the P&L. The other thing is we are still early in some of the acquisitions while we have made progress and certainly they are more profitable than when we acquired those businesses, we are not fully synergized. We just have some of that in front of us so you are adding a fairly significant book of revenue that is not at our going operating margins and therefore based on math, it shows some deleverage. As we laid out the plan in the Investor Day, tried to make clear that going forward we expect that leverage so we are giving a view that certainly we are going to grow income faster than the top line and that is really going to come from 3 things. One is to complete those synergies. The second thing as we return to growth and I think you've seen, we are making continued progress and we said it is going to grow in strength over the 3 years of that horizon. So we expect more organic growth and getting up to market growth toward the latter part and not immediately in 2015. That drop through will help us to leverage. And then the third piece maybe most importantly is that Invigorate will be large enough that it will offset any pricing and wage inflation headwinds and contribute to the bottom line which we have not been able to do in prior years.
Bill Bonello: Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. Just for a related follow-up then on that. Can you at this point - the acquisitions that you did over the last year, are they at this point additive to net income would you say? Maybe just some sense of maybe what their contribution would be relative to the rest of the business?
Mark Guinan: Yes, they are contributing to EPS as I said not at a margin ratio of the organic book of business. When we executed the deals, we talked about in the first half them being fairly breakeven and then contributing in the back half. So we haven't given a specific EPS contribution number, Bill, but it is positive and it will continue to improve throughout 2015 as well.
Bill Bonello: Thank you very much.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Darren Lehrich: Okay, thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Steve Rusckowski: Hi, Darren.
Darren Lehrich: So I just wanted to come back to your commentary about the 3-year outlook in the context of the 2015 guidance. And specifically just I want to better understand the cash flow dynamic in 2015. Mark, you alluded to management comp and the extra payroll cycle in 2015 as being the year-over-year factors. Can you just size those so we can understand the number CFFO number being down somewhat? And are you still thinking that high single-digit cash flow growth is possible over the 3-year outlook period?
Mark Guinan: Yes, certainly we expect cash flow to grow commensurate with our earnings growth going forward. You know the calendar, there is not even weeks in a calendar so every 7th year you end up with this payroll cycle issue. It is tens of millions of dollars so it is significant. And then the management comp piece which you will be able to see within the proxy and so on and so forth is also tens of millions of dollars. So really the $80 million decline that we are implying based on the guidance is more than covered by these 2 items so without these items we would be growing our operating cash flow and really these 2 items are explaining why it is down.
Darren Lehrich: Okay, that is helpful. I just wanted to follow-up if I could, Mark, on a comment you made around buyback and I guess the take away is that there isn't really much buyback in your outlook for EPS. But I just want to make sure I understand how you are framing it, is your buyback philosophy any different or are you just basically stating that your guidance doesn't contemplate a lot of buyback? I just want to understand if you have changed your stance on how you are going to deploy capital toward buyback in 2015?
Mark Guinan: No change. In our 5-point strategy, we talk about the fact that we are committed to a majority of our free cash flow returning to shareholders and then above and beyond that we weight the best use of cash or the most critical need for that cash and typically we say we balance that between M&A and additional share buybacks. Given the M&A we executed last year, we did take on some significant debt and we have been paying down that debt. So really this comment is more of a short-term - the guidance that we are giving, it includes a flat share count. At the Investor Day, I just for simplicity sake, I gave you earnings growth without share reductions, that does not imply that going forward there could not potentially be buybacks to reduce our shares outstanding. But it was really just to make it a little clearer in terms of what we were suggesting. For 2015, we have not in our guidance we have not assumed a reduction in our share count and we wanted to make sure that was clear.
Darren Lehrich: And so the guidance basically suggests about 6.5% EBIT growth, is that fair to say at the midpoint?
Mark Guinan: Yes, I think that is reasonable. As I am sure you understand when you have amortization fall off $0.04 approximately from 2014 to 2015, it actually makes the cash EPS look less favorable, I wouldn't expect that kind of a change every single year going forward. So it kind of confounds the comparison a little bit. So that is why we thought it was important to make clear that we started with the 6% to 10% on the old basis and then we kind of did the math and bridged to the cash. And so instead of $0.40 which it was in 2014, it is actually $0.36 in 2015 the amortization that we are adjusting out.
Darren Lehrich: Okay, thanks, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cherny from Evercore. Your line is open. 
Michael Cherny: Good morning, guys, and thanks all the details. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Cherny: So Steve, you made a pretty impassioned statement as I would view it relative to what is going on with the long-term review of the clinical lab fee schedule. And I keep coming back to this concept and topic of I think I tend to agree with you that the entire market should be represented in this testing basket. And so when you are having our conversations with CMS, what is the pushback as to why they say that at this point or why they are not jumping up and saying that this will be all the participants? Why are they holding back given the fact that this is still a pretty full market as you mentioned with all of the various different segments that are represented?
Steve Rusckowski: I will share with you - I wouldn't say that they are holding back. What we are doing is we're trying to work through this rulemaking process with them and if you think of about gathering all the data that they need to gather to get a real thorough reflection of the market, it is very complex. So you are dealing with all the independent commercial labs, big and small. You are dealing with all the contracts we all have with our commercial payers. And then you are dealing with all the different diagnostic tests that we have. And then also you are dealing with hospitals. And so part of this is trying to understand how they are going to require the reporting for a representative view of the market. It was always in the intention of the bill, it is in a bill that hospitals are part of the market and therefore they need to report. And what they are working through is how they are going to be able to accomplish what was intended by the bill from Congress and that is what they are working through. With anything, it just takes time. We haven't seen where they are with it. We continue the dialogue so as we said in our remarks, we are hopeful that we will see the rules in 2015 as we should so we can collect the data in 2016 and we shouldn't see an adjustment to the clinical lab piece scheduled sooner in 2017. And that is still the timetable we are working with and we are doing everything we can to help them to make sure they do realize that they will get our market representative view including all participants of the markets - the market including hospitals.
Michael Cherny: Thanks, Steve. Just quickly relative to the M&A comment, have you seen any change in the attitude of sellers over the last 3 to 6 months in terms of their willingness to sell either more willing or less willing given some of the changing market dynamics, given some of these questions you have brought up such as what is going to be included with the clinical lab fee schedule, what is going to happen with regards to FDA legislation, of LDTs, anything different when you go out and talk to potential acquisition targets?
Steve Rusckowski: I would say this is we have a right strategy. We have always had the strategy of getting a portion of our growth from acquisitions. We said 1% to 2%. As you know, we are higher than that number in 2014. We believe we will have some opportunities that as Mark said are not in our guidance in 2015. If you look at what we have acquired in the past, we think that's some hospital outreach businesses that we believe will be accretive to us. We picked up some regional laboratories, 1 big one with Solstas and then we bought a couple of business that are in a faster growing part of the market, this is Summit in wellness and also a business in drug for our solutions testing business which is quite strong for us. So we are optimistic that we do have a reasonable pipeline for acquisitions and we believe we will meet again our commitment of that 1% to 2% topline growth in acquisitions in 2015. As far as is there more interest or less interest, I won't comment on that. I would just say it is consistent with what we have seen so far. But healthcare in general is going to consolidate and we will be a consolidator and therefore we think for the mid- to the long-term this is the strategy.
Michael Cherny: Thank you very much.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bret Jones from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Bret.
Bret Jones: Hey. Good morning.
Steve Rusckowski: Hey. Good morning.
Bret Jones: Hey. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about, we have been talking about M&A quite a bit this morning. Can you talk about what happened with the Summit Health deal in terms of reversing the contingent consideration? Was this relative to kind of volume expectations, was it cost synergies a little bit behind schedule or anything along those lines?
Mark Guinan: This is Mark. It was completely revenue based and nothing to do with cost. And I'm sure you are familiar with some of the ways that you work through differences between buyer and seller over the projection of the business going forward is setting up some of these contingent considerations or earn outs. And without getting into too much detail, you might assume that the seller have a view and we have a little different view and so that is the way we came to an agreement on the purchase price. So we are happy with the performance of Summit. It is meeting our expectations. It may have fell short from some potential upside that would have given the seller some upside in the purchase price.
Bret Jones: Okay, great. Then I just wanted to follow-up on the reimbursement side of the equation for next year within your guidance. Are you still assuming a 1% to 2% pressure? I wasn't quite clear. I know you said lower government pressure but I didn't know what you were contemplating on the private pay side?
Steve Rusckowski: Dan, do you want to handle that one?
Dan Haemmerle: Sure. The 1% to 2% is really the range that we have given at our 2012 Investor Day and it related to the period 2013 to 2015. So if you look at that period, that 1% to 2% range we still feel pretty good about what we said for next year. No specific guidance but we would expect that reimbursement pressure will be more along the lines of what you saw in 2014.
Mark Guinan: Yes, so the 1% to 2% included 3% in 2013 and so that was not 1% or 2% every year. It was a CAGR and then to be clear as Dan said, we said 2015 should be more like this past year.
Bret Jones: And then can you just…
Steve Rusckowski: And then one…
Bret Jones: I’m sorry. 
Steve Rusckowski: Lab fee schedule - the effect that we know of. Yes. 
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. So the clinical lab fee schedule on the Medicare side has been reduced for 2015. It is a combination of a couple of different factors but it is going to be a reduction of about 25 basis points and on the physician fee schedule that is one where there is some codes - some codes that have moved up, some codes that have moved down and net net it is really essentially neutral in rounding in terms of how you think about overall impact.
Steve Rusckowski: So those 2 pieces are less than what we have seen for the last 3 years.
Bret Jones: That's very help. Lastly, any big commercial renewals that you have coming up?
Steve Rusckowski: Nothing that is notable that we would share at this point.
Bret Jones: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.
Amanda Murphy: Hey. Good morning, guys. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Amanda
Mark Guinan: Good morning.
Amanda Murphy: Just a quick question on the mix. I think you mentioned that the mix benefit was positive this quarter and I am thinking if we do the math it is around 50 basis points. I wasn't sure about that but can you just talk a little bit about what is driving that? And then how you think about that going forward because I think mix has been a pretty - it has been at least a headwind for a long time here so just curious about next year if you can give any commentary there? Thanks.
Mark Guinan: Yes, it was a help. As we introduce new offerings like BRCA that tend to have a higher value per requisition, certainly that helps. Some of the headwinds that we have had in the past as we have always shared has been really in the pathology part of our business which does also have a high value per requisition and some of these reimbursement cuts in that space which certainly has impacted overall revenue per requisition. And again, I want to stress that you should not assume there is a direct relationship between higher revenue per requisition as a higher margin and lower revenue per requisition as a lower margin. It can be a little bit misleading at times depending on whether it goes up or down and making an assumption on that impact on the bottom line. So we really expect as we continue to go forward overall to see favorable mix as we introduce some of these new higher value service offerings.
Steve Rusckowski: And Amanda, we saw, as Mark said, some growth in esoteric, we also saw overall continued progression and improvement in our overall test per requisition as well.
Amanda Murphy: So is the right way to think about it kind of in that 50 basis points ballpark? It used to be higher than that at one point I think.
Mark Guinan: Yes, it used to be higher. If you look at what we said, the reimbursement pressure was less than 50 basis points, the business and test mix offset that to get us from a revenue per requisition perspective essentially flat. So it is something less than 50 basis points is a fair way to think about it.
Amanda Murphy: And just last one. I don't think you mentioned the Mopath situation. Has there been any change there in terms of payments from some of the legacy - ?
Mark Guinan: No changes at this point, Amanda, nothing really worth mentioning on the call.
Amanda Murphy: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Isaac Ro: Good morning, guys. Thank you. 
Steve Rusckowski: Good morning, Isaac.
Mark Guinan: Good morning, Isaac.
Isaac Ro: Hey. I just want to ask a question on free cash flow. You had a nice improvement year-on-year but we are still off the high from 2012. So would you be willing to offer a little bit of guidance on what you think free cash flow could look like this year and what some of the key levers are to driving it?
Mark Guinan: The guidance that we provided is $850 million in operating cash flow and $300 million approximately in capital. Certainly 2012 when you look back 2012, the EPS was again higher than 2013, 2014. We are starting to get back to that relative level. We do have some - as I said, some headwinds this year. Again back to that payroll cycle again, it is the same amount of expense flowing through the P&L. It just happens that if you cut the checks on December 31 instead of January 1, it happens to hit your operating cash flow in 1 year versus the next year. So that is really the anomaly that I think distorting our cash flow both operating and free cash flow in 2015 relative to really the performance trend. So we are very focused on cash. Hopefully, Isaac, you see that. We have said that we expect cash to grow commensurate with earnings. As we move forward and get the high single digits to potentially 10% compound earnings growth over the next several years, you should expect cash to be in that ballpark.
Steve Rusckowski: Isaac, one other comment just on the 2012 strong performance. Keep in mind there were some tax payments that got deferred into 2013 related to Hurricane Sandy and some benefit related to some interest-rate swaps so a couple of items there that helped that 2012 performance.
Isaac Ro: Sure, understand that. Thank you. Just secondly on portfolio rationalization, I think you mentioned a little bit kind of your thoughts around progressing there. Wondering if you could maybe put some criteria out for us in terms of what you are using to evaluate some of those moves?
Mark Guinan: We use similar financial metrics that we would use for an acquisition so we look at kind of the standalone. If we continue to hold onto that asset and what kind of value creation we think would take place if we held onto it and then we would look at what the market might offer us for that same cash flow. Or potentially in the cases where we monetize where they may have a better view of cash flow and think they can do better with the assets than we could. And that is where you can end up finding a deal. So it is really back down to the financial metrics around NPBs and looking at the return on invested capital and things like the earnings impact. That is the evaluation we use.
Isaac Ro: Got it. Thanks so much, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: Thanks, Isaac.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Bryan Brokmeier: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. 
Steve Rusckowski: Hey, Bryan. Good morning.
Bryan Brokmeier: Looking at the impact ACA had on your business in 2014, could you provide some color to help us anticipate how volumes and revenues may impacting 2015? Should we start to see it happen somewhat quickly in the first quarter, maybe a quarter or 2 later? Sort of some color around what you saw last year.
Steve Rusckowski: So what we have said in 2014 is we started to see some modest underlying improvement particularly around Medicaid lives with the expansion of Medicaid in many of the states. That was probably the most notable lives that we saw entering the system. And as I said earlier as far as our market projections, we do believe there is going to be gradually more insured lives in this country going forward and when those matured lives enter the system they are going to need what we do and that is a good fact. We think the Medicaid volume dynamic we saw in 2014 will continue. We think the exchanges will continue to build and then we also think the employer mandate will help us as well. So this will be a gradual build. We haven't given specifics but it is already assumed in our view of the market and assumed in our view of our guidance or outlook for 2015.
Bryan Brokmeier: Okay, thanks. Mark, fuel prices have been cut in half. I know it is not a large expense for you but if 1% of your cost decline by 50% that translates into $0.03 or $0.04 in EPS or 2% to 3% in EPS growth by my estimates. Is a 1% of your total cost a fair estimate of what you fuel costs were and now they are about 0.5% of your total cost? And the $0.03 to $0.04 a fair estimate?
Mark Guinan: Yes, what I will tell you Bryan, is it is significantly less than 1% so it is not at the 1%. It certainly is helpful and I was asked this question at the previous call that it is small millions. It is not several pennies but it is certainly helpful to our cost at this point.
Bryan Brokmeier: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Speaker: Hey. Good morning. This is Zach [ph] for Ricky. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on ACA a little bit. And if you look at the actual lives from the ACA whether it is Medicare exchanges, are you seeing from the individuals any commentary you can give on the actual utilization of those individuals versus the total number entering? And then what you are seeing from pricing on exchanges versus utilization or versus Medicaid?
Steve Rusckowski: First of all, what we said before, we are doing every quarter we do a dipstick reading on what is going on with our underlying volumes and you heard in my remarks to start this call, we actually are calling it now on a same provider basis. So we are taking good existing customers, we are comparing year-on-year assuming that whatever volume increases we see there are really truly utilization increases. What we said last what are we will continue to say this today, we are seeing some slight improvement in underlying utilization and we think that is a good indication of what could be happening in the marketplace but that is what we have seen so far. As far as pricing on the exchanges, we actually have said in the past we think it is consistent with what we see in general in our commercial contracts so we feel okay about that for now.
Unidentified Speaker: Okay, cool. Thank you. Then just on your market share growth versus the hospital labs, I know earlier you talked about excluding hospital outreach, any changes in the dynamics of what you are seeing from hospital-based testing?
Steve Rusckowski: What we saw happening in the last 2 or 3 years is hospitals buying physicians and as they bought physicians their trying to direct a lot of the laboratory services to their outreach businesses and that did have an effect on this industry. The overall acquisition of physicians by integrated delivery systems continues but they are running out of some room. Obviously in the specialist areas, most of the specialists in some specialist areas are already working for integrated delivery services or integrated delivery networks like cardiologists but there is still some primary care practices that are starting to pull in. With that said, we believe it is less of a dynamic than we have seen in the past but it is still a dynamic, they do compete with us in the marketplace and that is why it is so important that when we look at this market based view on prices that we will use for the refresh of the clinical lab fee schedule that we include them in the market.
Unidentified Speaker: Great, thank you.
Steve Rusckowski: Thank you.
Mark Guinan: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey. Good morning, guys. Hi. Good morning. So just a follow-up to that last question. As you talk to your hospital partners and some of your targets, how are they viewing the potential changes to reimbursement because it could be a pretty significant cut for them. So is this starting to drive the conversation of them wanting to pursue or explore strategic alternatives or options for those hospital-based labs?
Steve Rusckowski: This is why we have focused on this as one of our 3 platforms of growth in our restore growth strategies. We built a laboratory professional services business and what we are doing is having a dialogue with the CEO and CFO of integrated delivery systems around their labs strategy which would include how we can help them run their inpatient plan which we call laboratory management and what we can do to be a bigger strategic supplier for their more advanced testing we call reference testing. And then finally is what are their plans around outreach. And in those dialogues and I will share with you that our funnel and our prospect list of those conversations has built to a higher level than we would have anticipated. The interest of having the dialogue has increased and very rarely do we find a C-suite of an integrated delivery system not interested in that discussion. So what you are talking about and what you are asking is right in line with our strategy and we are still very optimistic about the prospects on this part of our strategy.
Brian Tanquilut: The follow-up question for you, obviously congratulations on finally getting the organic growth same-store positive. But what gives you guys the confidence that we can get to 2% to 3% number considering that we are coming off of a positive 40 basis point number for Q4?
Steve Rusckowski: Remember the 2% to 3% does include the carryover on acquisitions. It doesn't contemplate new acquisitions. And what you have seen is our progress on the underlying organic volumes over the last several quarters and particularly in the back half, we are tracking at a better level than we did in the first half. So that is why we feel good about our outlook for 2015.
Brian Tanquilut: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Steve Rusckowski: With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call. As you can see we are making good progress executing our strategy. We met our commitments for 2014 and we raised our dividend once again. We appreciate your support. And I would like to wish you all a good day. Operator?

Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our Web site at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the Web site. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I will provide you with highlights of the quarter. We will share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. During the third quarter we delivered against our expectations. Continued to make progress against our strategy and reported top and bottom line growth. In the quarter, revenues grew 6.5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.10 and cash from operations was strong at $271 million. What I would like to do is start with some brief comments on industry trends. We have said, diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare and we are determined to be paid appropriate for the value we provide. In this respect our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but the reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do. To give you an example, in July, Tricare announced it had committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases. During the third quarter, we saw progress of payment on codes that previously had been denied. This is a nice sign of progress we are making as an industry. Also in April, Congress passed the so called Doc Fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule until 2017. We have been working with our industry trade association to participate in a rule making process. This will define new rates based on a market weighted median of commercial rates from a broad range of labs which include both large and small independent labs as well as hospital outreach labs. We remain hopeful that this will produce a representative view of market‐based pricing. Being appropriately reimbursed for the value we provide is critical to our success and we compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price. Also, we continue to work closely with our trade association on another important issue. And that is to oppose the FDA’s proposal to regulate laboratory developed tests, referred to as LDTs. We strongly believe that unnecessary and duplicative regulation could delay patient access to life saving treatments and compromise America’s leadership in diagnostic discovery. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, while it’s still early, we continued to see modest shifts from uninsured patient volumes in the third quarter to government and other payers. Regarding the market dynamics, we saw additional signs of improvement in healthcare utilization during the quarter. And then finally, we will provide you an update on our views on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day in New York City on November 5th. Now let’s look at the progress we’re making executing our five point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we again made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we’ve made and efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are yielding positive results. We saw continued improvement in sequential trends in revenues, organic volume and organic price. If we exclude business we walked away from, organic revenues would be favorable. Revenues showed strong growth in several product categories driven by our clinical franchises, which included prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness, and infectious disease. Last quarter we told you about the partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Our plans were to provide annotated reports on solid tumor analysis based on a panel of 34 clinically actionable gene mutations. We launched those expanded OncoVantage panels during the third quarter. Solid tumor cancers account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year. Also, as promised, we began to offer our customers national access to Sequenom’s non‐invasive prenatal test. And we continue to build our professional lab services business and finalized yet another agreement with a medium sized community hospital on the East Coast. We are making good progress advancing conversations from our pipeline into proposals and new business. These are all great examples of how we are empowering better health with diagnostic insights to make this a better world. We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made a number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our lab of the future in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England market. The Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. As you know, the company shared an initial target of $500 million in July of 2011. Since then, we have increased that target to $600 million. Delivered the original target a year earlier, and now expect to exceed the new run rate target by delivering $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014. Over the past year, we have been advising you that we will update our future plans for Invigorate at Investor Day. We intend to deliver on that commitment and we will provide you with additional details on our plans to deliver total run rate savings in excess of $1 billion. In addition, we made progress integrating recent acquisitions. We told you that Solstas and Summit were expected to be dilutive for the first half of 2014 but accretive in the back half as we work through our integration plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made realizing the expected synergies. I’m happy to report that these acquisitions as well as Steward and ConVerge, were all accretive on an adjusted basis during the quarter. The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence. Our simplify strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign to also include improving our organizational capabilities, culture and processes. We continue to strengthen the management team and build a high performance culture. And we have also continued to strengthen our board. Recently, the board elected Dr. Jeffrey Leiden as our newest Director. He currently serves as Chairman, CEO and President of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Jeff is the third new board member added this year with significant CEO experience. Coupling this with his deep management, scientific and clinical background in healthcare, this will strengthen and complement our board’s capabilities. Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We generated $271 million in cash from operations during the quarter. We utilized that strong cash flow performance to return value to our shareholders through dividends and stock buyback program and to repay debt associated with the Solstas transaction. As you can see, we continued to make progress executing our five point strategy. Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our latest guidance details. Mark?
Mark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 6.5% ahead of the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and the divestiture of the Enterix business last year, our underlying consolidated revenues were essentially flat to the prior year, reflecting another sequential step forward in our path to restoring growth. Our diagnostic information services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition in Q3 was 60 basis points lower than the prior year. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, revenue per requisition was slightly favorable versus the prior year, and improved sequentially from the second quarter of 2014. Compared to a year ago, price pressure continued to moderate and we benefited from favorable test mix. Volume for the quarter was 7.8% favorable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 8% to volumes. Last quarter, I shared that we had made prudent decisions regarding pricing and in some cases decided to walk away from existing business. Excluding the impact on revenue from these decisions, our underlying volumes were favorable to the prior year by approximately 1.5% and represents another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year volume growth. Q3 revenues in our diagnostic solutions businesses which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were lower by about 70 basis points compared to the prior year. The divestiture of Enterix reduced revenues for our diagnostic solutions businesses by nearly 2%. Excluding this impact, our diagnostic solutions businesses grew by approximately 1% compared to the third quarter of a year ago. Adjusted operating income at 16% of revenues was about 50 basis points below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to the increased funding of management compensation compared to a year ago and the initial lower margin profile on our recent acquisitions. Earlier this year we shared with you that we expected the Summit and Solstas acquisitions to be dilutive in the first half of the year and accretive in the back half of the year. I am happy to report that these acquisitions were accretive in the third quarter on an adjusted basis as we made nice progress on those integration plans. In addition to delivering on our integration plans, we continued to make progress on our Invigorate program. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion over time. As I shared last quarter, we will provide additional details at our Investor Day in November. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was 7.8% better than a year ago. As a result of the company’s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $48 million, principally related to restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.6% and reported EPS by $0.22. Last year’s third quarter reported operating income from continuing operations included the gain on the sale of Ibrutinib royalty rights, the loss on sale of the Enterix business and restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a net benefit to reported operating income of $395 million or $1.64 per diluted share. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Our DSOs were 46 days, a 1 day improvement from last quarter. Cash from operations was $271 million in the quarter compared to $186 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $102 million in the quarter compared to $51 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $62.03. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments for the year by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also made progress against our debt repayment commitment by reducing our debt by approximately $90 million in the quarter. Turning to guidance. We now expect full year 2014 results from continuing operations, before special items, as follows. Revenues to grow approximately 3.5% compared to a year ago versus 2.5% to 3.5% previously. Adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.03 and $4.07 compared to previous guidance of $4.00 and $4.10. Cash provided by operations to approximate $900 million and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Now I’ll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Mark, if I recall correctly, about a year ago you joined Quest. And actually a year ago on this call you shared several priorities. And those priorities included improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our five point strategy. Just as we are making progress on our five point strategy, we are also making progress on our commitment to improve our guidance and deliver on our commitments. Well, to summarize. We delivered a second solid quarter of top line growth as we continue to build momentum. We made good progress executing our strategy and our Invigorate program remains firmly on track. As a result, we delivered 8% earnings per share growth and we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014. And then finally, I would like to share, I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide some longer term perspective and deeper updates on our strategic plan. Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser. Sir, your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: First, a quick question on the volume number. Mark, you talked about 1.5% organic volume figure for the quarter which I think is the best number that you have done for a very long time. So can you just share with us, where are the volumes coming from? Are you seeing it from exchange population, Medicaid population, or are you starting to see improvement in core business utilization? And also just kind of the margins that are associated with the new business.
Mark Guinan: Thanks for the question Ricky. Couple of things. First off, organic volume was pretty flat year-over-year. What I talked about is, there were a couple of specific accounts that we had made a decision based on pricing to walk away from, earlier in the year. And what I said is, if you exclude those then that volume would have been up 1.5%. But nonetheless, I think the important message is that organic volume trends continue to improve. And when we started in the beginning of 2013, minus 200 basis points, since then we have crossed the threshold to less than 100 basis points of decline. And now essentially organic volume has been flat in the most recent quarters. So there is an improving trend. Where is that coming from? I think it's somewhat across the board by payer type. We did say there was some reduction in the uninsured. We had continued to see some modest growth in Medicaid. However, it's really in some of the growth past our franchises that we have talked about before. So PDM continues to be an area of strength. Hepatitis C continues to be an area of strength. Obviously, we have launched our BRCA offering which is growing. So it's no single payer. I couldn’t certainly attribute it specifically to anything in the Affordable Care Act. Although, certainly it seems like it’s directionally positive. So that’s what I would say is, it's continued growth in the areas that have been growing and just utilization picking up a little bit and then I think just our business gaining strength.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And just kind of like, one follow-up there. Obviously, I think last quarter you said that the impact on volume, once you normalize from the businesses you exit was about 1%. It seems like it is 1.5% now. So is this a function of you exiting additional accounts, or is this just kind of like an impact of a full quarter of the same existing business that you have exited last quarter?
Mark Guinan: It's the same account. It's not additional accounts. So it's really just the impact in this quarter was a little larger than the impact in the previous quarter, given the timing.
Stephen Rusckowski: What you see though as you said it, is as we’ve said consistently, we are going to move step-by-step improving our underlying business. And you see some underlying improvement in the third quarter versus Q2. So we feel good about that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Glen Santangelo. Sir, your line is open.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Steve, just wanted to follow up with you on some of the pricing comments that you made. It seems like the company also experienced a sequential improvement in organic pricing trends. And so I am wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit more color and clarity around what you are seeing in terms of Medicaid pricing? Any big commercial contracts coming up or what's really driven that slightly better organic pricing number?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Thanks, Glen. If you go back to 2012, we have been consistently talking about this. We provided guidance that over a three-year period we expected real price, and when we say real price it’s really freezing other variables and just looking at unit price changes with contracts and Medicare, Medicaid reimbursement, would be reduced by 1% to 2%. It was higher in 2013. And then what we also said is, we believe it's going to be lower this year into 2015. And we actually believe we are on track to achieve that guidance we provided. In that respect, we are seeing lower year-on-year comparisons on pricing, sequential year-on-year comparisons in price. Contractually, we have the visibility of this. We don’t have any major renewals coming forward. We already shared with you the effect of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule on our price this year, which was about 1.75% this year. And then also what we see overall if you look at revenue per req, is a mix in our business. So when you go through that mix in our business which is different than what we talk about with price, this quarter and even compared to Q2 we saw a richer mix which generated revenue per req which was favorable. So, Mark, I don’t know if you would like to add to any of that.
Mark Guinan: Yes. I think Steve covered it. We said in the first quarter price was down about 100 basis points and second quarter about 80 basis points, and this quarter was down about 30. I think it's a combination of the timing of contracts being more disciplined but also, quite frankly, putting more rigor into our pricing efforts across the organization on things such as client bill negotiations and things like that. So I think as an organization we have really instilled a greater discipline around price and obviously we are also benefitting from the timing of contracts that we didn’t benefit from in 2013. And then to Steve's mention of revenue per req, when you exclude the impact of acquisition mix as I said, revenue per req was actually up and so it was some slight price decline offset by some favorable tests and payer mix.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: And maybe if I could just follow up with one sort of longer-term question on pricing. Obviously, a lot of questions around 2017 and the potential changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And I think, Steve, you commented on some of the lobbying efforts that are going on. Could you maybe give us some of your initial reactions with maybe how you see market pricing being defined by the regulations and who is included and who is excluded in that sort of market price? And are you sort of happy with the direction that’s heading as obviously it's going to have some impact on your business and I am just curious if there is any comments to kind of make, initial comments to make at this point. Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Glen, I appreciate that. Well, as I said, we are working hard as a trade association. We are all working on this because it's very important. First of all, we are working with CMS on the rule making process to make sure we get it right. And as a matter of fact a couple of weeks ago we were visiting CMS and we were talking through how they will gather the data. You cannot get a full view of the market without all the competitors in the market. And as I said in my introductory comments, that includes large independent labs like ourselves, smaller independents and hospital outreach. We have been consistent on that and we are trying to work through just how we will collect the data from all those three pieces to get a real representative view on the market. As you know, there is wide variation in pricing and actually we provided in the market from the trade association, a quick snapshot on what we believe the true market-based pricing would be by certain codes we did a sample on. And we look at that actually, the CMS prices are not widely out of line from the median that we had sought on the market in that survey. So we will continue to work through the rule making process. They will gather the data in 2016. And Glen, until you gather the data you do not know what the results are. But if we have a thorough process, a good process and we really gather the data to really get a market-based price, we believe that the outcome will be the outcome but it's not nearly as bad as what some people have intended. But we have got some work in front of us to keep on working on this to get it right in the process and gather the data correctly and correctly represent that in the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Cherny. Sir, your line is open.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group: So I want to delve a little bit more into some of the commentary you had around the business that you walked away from. As you think about, I think you did this on pretty much contract by contract basis, but what are some of the metrics specifically? I assume it's not just price or just margin. I mean how much of it is impacted by the return you got from the businesses. Maybe walk through some of the financial metrics that will cause you to say that this contract or this business is no longer for us.
Stephen Rusckowski: Let me start and then I'm going to turn it to Mark. First of all, we're trying to build value as you would expect we would. And in building value we're trying to make sure that we drive earnings per share growth which you saw this quarter. And in that regard there is lots of levers and one of which is price. And in our portfolio of our clients and our customers, and we have a wide range of customers and clients. And so what we have done in executing our plans is to take a careful look at all the business we do and to make sure we keep on getting as much value out of those accounts as possible. So some of this I would describe it as hygiene to keep on working through our portfolio of businesses and some of the actions we have taken have helped us improve our margins and you see that reflected in this quarter's results. But, Mark, why don't you add to that, specifically what have we adjusted for to get to 1.5% growth, when we adjust for these decisions we have made.
Mark Guinan: Yes, I think even Michael was asking also about the decision criteria. So, yes, obviously the margin is a significant driver in the decision which of course is the outcome of price, with some variables depending on where the geographic location for that business is and therefore what are the other costs associated with it, such as logistics and so on and so forth. What does the book of business look like in terms of the test mix and the payer mix. So there is a number of things that go into it. Pricing is the biggest driver in that margin decision but there are some cost variables as well that we look at. I think the importance here in why we decided to share it was we wanted to send the message that not all volume is value creating volume and we are focused on value creating volume. And there is also some competitors in the marketplace that compete on price, that is not us. And to the extent that we find ourselves in situations where the price is not rational, we are going to walk away and we are going to stick with our strategy. So that's really why we decided to share this. It's not as much about in some way modeling a organic volume and suggesting it's different than what the actual results are, but helping people understand that volume alone is not going to give you margin and growth, your bottom line and your cash flow, but it's got to be value creating volume.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group: Thanks. And then just one quick question or quick thought on some of these hospital outsource arrangements. So obviously a new opportunity for you. Can you talk about how some of those conversations evolve? You talked about the midsized hospital on the East Coast. What led them to decide to work with you and then over time what type of capacity you have to add on incremental types of these contracts?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. It comes to us in a lot of different ways, Mike. First of all, we have a sales force that's selling to about 50% of the hospitals. So we have good presence in all the hospital systems throughout the United States with our sales force. Second is, we have very good executive access. And when we talk about this as part of our strategy, we have garnered a lot of interest from hospital executives. And quite often myself and a few of the leaders on this business are spending time discussing with hospital CEOs and typically there CFO, what their lab strategy is. And like so much in healthcare, you see one then you see one. And so we sit down and we have a conversation about our lab strategy and we talk about the whole range of possibilities of different working relationships, where we can do reference work, we could buy your outreach business, we can form a joint venture. We can run your hospital laboratory, which we call laboratory management. And we eventually end up with a place that is tailored to what they are trying to achieve in their system. And so the contracts and engagements we have announced, all are very different, all are quite different. And I could tell you that some are small community hospitals and some discussions that we are having are large, very large integrated delivery systems that are substantially re-engineering what they are doing in healthcare. And as part of that they are thinking about where they put their resources and what's the best approach to laboratory services. And in that respect we are generally thought of as a trusted partner and we could help them with that. So that’s the way we approach it.
Mark Guinan: And I just want to add, Mike, just to be clear. When you ask about capacity, certainly a lot of these deals come with reference work. So we may have been doing the reference work or we may be getting the reference work. But in many cases we are actually managing their work for us. So it's not additional strain on our lab capacity. It's actually our capabilities to help them run their lab better together with our procurement leverage, is really where the value creation comes from. So it's not bringing all their in-house testing into the walls of our laboratory. It's actually running their lab for them with their people.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group: No, that’s very helpful.
Stephen Rusckowski: Just to add to that. When we have a large hospital laboratory management deal, what we arrive at is an opportunity for them to save somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% on their hospital based laboratory cost. And one potential strategy we deploy to get there is we take a portion of their menu and we actually move it to our geographic laboratory in the system. The more high volume oriented portion of their menu where we could still respond in an adequate way to meet the requirements of running their hospital. And so it's good for us because as you know most of our laboratories are really in full force starting at midnight to 8 o'clock in the morning. And so during the day we actually have a lot of capacity idle and so it's an opportunity for us to use that capacity to help with this portion of our business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Clair. Sir, your line is open.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: I guess the first one from me, just wondering, you spoke about the FDA regulation of LDTs. So just curious, what your exposure there is and what do you think the cost would be to push these through for approval?
Stephen Rusckowski: Well, first of all as you all know, we are already regulated. So we already meet the requirements of CLIA. So we have already have oversight. And so the question that we all have as an industry is, why do we need more and some portion of this would be redundant with what we are already meeting. And so there is a concern about how these two (indiscernible) as we go forward. And frankly the proposal in the language has been silent on that topic. Second is, in essence, what the language would say is that LDTs are devices, medical devices. And when you meet the regs of medical devices, there are substantial changes in getting regulatory approval for new products and also having a quality system that meet those regs. We haven't provided the size of that for labs like ourselves but it's not insignificant. And there's two parts again. There is one getting a new product to the marketplace and new solution to the marketplace and then second is, running your operation on a day to day basis. Our concern, particularly when new innovation comes to the marketplace is, what it would take for us to bring new innovation. Particularly in the case where some laboratory developed tests may require a PMA for approval and that’s a lengthy drawn up process. Where today we believe we can with good data, support that our LDTs we introduce to the marketplace are safe and efficacious and therefore do not require what a device manufacture would need, and that’s our position on it. So we haven't sized it. We haven't provided it. But it is substantial. There is concern about the redundancy that we would have in this industry. And what we would like to do is to understand what we can do to bring these points forward as a trade association and we are doing that.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was just hoping that we could get a quick update on some of the women's health products. So specifically, Pap volumes, BRCAvantage and IPT?
Stephen Rusckowski: Sure. Mark mentioned where we are getting some of our growth. Well, BRCA continues to grow. We are seeing nice sequential pickup in our offering in the marketplace. As you know, that’s a big market and a market that’s still growing and we are starting to gain some share. So we feel good about progress made there. In non-invasive prenatal testing, we talked about our introduction of Sequenom's solution in the marketplace. We are seeing nice growth in that market. And as far as Pap is concerned, we continue to see the slowdown of volumes quarter on quarter until we get to some normal steady state of volumes given the new clinical guidelines that are out there in the marketplace. So we still haven't quite bottomed out there yet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier. Sir, your line is open.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Steve, you said that you saw a richer mix of business. Was any of that mix onetime in nature? Was it a trend of higher priced tests that you expect to continue? I assme the BRCA test is one positive factor there that should continue but are there others?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. So if you look at some of the growth we talked about, most of the products we are introducing in our clinical franchise is our new solutions that have higher prices. And so therefore if you look at the mix going forward, you should see some effect for that on a continual basis. So that’s some of it. Second is, we did say that the acquisitions that we brought into the sector are revenue per req, and if you adjust for that we actually saw the improvement year-on-year. But there is nothing here that was one big one off if you will, if that’s what you are asking, that won't continue going forward. Mark, you will like to add to that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Just to add to that. Steve talked about the fact that we had actually Tricare payments. But as we have said before, and I will confirm, it's not material. So it's good to see that. That’s a positive sign. But that was not an extraordinary catch up. It's not significant in terms of our overall revenue but still nice to see. So absolutely not. This is really where the business is trending. There is nothing unusual and actually we would expect to see more growth in those higher value hence higher priced areas and favorable mix going forward. The one exception is, we've talked about our laboratory professional services does have a lower revenue per req. So obviously depending on the timing of some of those deals, that could have a mix impact that goes the other direction. But as we have also stated that despite the lower margins, those are very attractive from a return on invested capital perspective. So still very value creating.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Okay. And the unprofitable business that you walked away from, were these contracts that you had to terminate, were you able to renegotiate terms and similar agreements that you ended up not terminating? And are there more of these that you may walk away from in the current quarter or in the 2015?
Mark Guinan: Yes. What I would say is, as Steve mentioned, we did some hygiene work. So we looked across our portfolio and we looked at some specific books of business that we didn’t think were creating acceptable value. We engaged with those parties around some pricing discussions, weren't able to come to a reasonable outcome in our onion. And that was kind of a discrete exercise which I would call a portfolio rationalization. As we go forward, we are going to have the same discipline in any new offerings, any renegotiations etc. etc. So there always could be, for the same reason, account that we walk away from because we say, hey, given your pricing position and the competitive price environment, this just doesn't make sense for us. However, I don't want anyone to think that there is going to be regular rhythm of exiting accounts. This was really kind of a refresh of our portfolio and that’s we have taken the time to talk about it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Darren Lehrich. Sir, your line is open.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: So I just wanted to come back to the margin topic. It sounds like you clearly exited some unprofitable business that accelerated in the third quarter. And then Mark you are describing a little bit of a pick up from Tricare and I think you said in your prepared remarks that the deals were accretive in the second half versus dilutive. So when we look at margins down year-over-year and sort of a stable pricing environment and some of the things you are describing. What are some of the other factors at play with margin? Is it the mix of your hospital management business? Maybe just help us think about the margin decline year-over-year despite, I guess, some of the things you have described in the exited businesses which were a drag.
Mark Guinan: So obviously, Darren, margin is our total enterprise and when you look at despite the fact that the acquisitions were accretive, they are not yet to the margins of the ongoing organic business. So from a mix perspective year-over-year since we didn’t have those books of business, there is some negative mix impact. We also reference the fact that, we have talked several times about the fact that management incentive comp would be a headwind this year because last year we didn’t pay out anywhere near the target and we are still accruing and hoping and expecting to pay out more to that target. So that’s a headwind as well. And then we have talked about inflation. But with the $200 million we are getting from Invigorate, largely those two things, the inflation and the management comp, should be offset. So really what you are looking at here largely is a combination of the mix impact of the new book of business we have and then bad debt was up 40 basis points year-over-year. And I would really say, those are really the contributors to that decline. So we feel good about the margin going forward, the margin profile. Certainly also as you mentioned, some of these laboratory professional services which were really just starting to ramp up, initially just like an acquisition those margins are now or they are going to be in the long run because there is things to do to get those operationally to their long term margin. So it's a lot of different pieces but we feel good about generally where our margin is heading.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just remind us, again the management incentive comp, the year-over-year impact on margin from that?
Mark Guinan: We haven't quantified it. But typically we said, hey, and previously if we get about $200 million of Invigorate savings, when you add merit inflation and I guess SWB inflation and the management comp, we had a big chunk of that was going to be taken up for both of those items. So it's not insignificant.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then my follow-up here is just, as it relates to like your pathology. You mentioned some modest success with Tricare. We have been hearing that still a lot of the State Medicaid programs are challenging in terms of getting paid for molecular pathology. So how much is still out there in terms of what was denied and can you just give us a brief update on how you are seeing the progress with some of the state programs.
Stephen Rusckowski: Dan, why don't you take that one?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, Darren, we have said in the past the total molecular coding impact for us when you look at the umbrella of tests we're looking at, represented about 5% of consolidated revenues. That puts an umbrella over the entire amount. When you look at this and that 5% across all payers, okay, commercial payers, government payers, etc., we continue to work through this with all the payers, commercial payers as well as government. And on the Medicaid program, that's state by state and its code by code. So we are engaging in different discussions in different states and a different levels of success. We spoke to one state last year that had overturned their position and started to reimburse on a particular code late in last year. So there was a positive sign there. Other states have been more challenged to move the bar with that. But it's something we continue to work on and we look at. The state we reference last year, we look at the Tricare scenario here that we talked about earlier today, is two good proof points and we will continue to work the issue one payer at a time.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line is open.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs: Just wanted to a question about fourth quarter seasonality. You know we have seen an uptick in healthcare utilization across the board, I think in the fourth quarter for the last few years. And I'm wondering if your guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that trend will continue or perhaps increase this fourth quarter.
Stephen Rusckowski: Mark, why don't you take a [shot at] (ph) seasonality we see in Q4 typically?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Obviously, when we model any given quarter, we model the year, we take into account historical performance. So any sort of seasonality we may or may not have seen would be one of the basis for our forecast. So I don't think we are expecting any significant deviation from our quarterly pattern. So really what's driving Q4 is where we see the business trending, both in terms of some of the growth areas, some of the areas that may be a little drag like Paps. And then things like potential for laboratory professional service in fields and so on and so forth. So we are expecting a, I think as we get into this time of year, a average weather month. So we certainly have built in, based on history, some sort of weather impact. But nothing extraordinarily good or nothing extraordinarily bad at this point.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs: If I could just scratch you a little bit there. I mean what is different this year then of course the enrollment for ACA and all that is changing. Deductibles and cost burdens and so forth. So there is plenty of reason to think that people might be deferring utilization till the end of the year and all that. So I am just curious, as you think about forecasting, that was a meaningful change to your process?
Mark Guinan: That certainly, I think could be within the trends we have already seen from the third quarter, some of that. Maybe more pronounced in Q4, given, hey, I got a procedure better I do it in December than January. Is it material enough at this point? Is it materially different enough from what it has been historically? Don’t know. We have not certainly built anything that’s a major shift change. So, yes, I think that dynamic has always existed with people that have high deductible plans and certainly the trend has been more and more private plans as well have a high deductible feature. So we have not assumed any major impact from the Affordable Care Act that will kind of skew fourth quarter. And if it's upside, we will be pleasantly pleased as much as anybody else.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy. Ma'am, your line is open.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: I just had a follow-up on the PMA discussion. So in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of hospitals, do you have a sense of how CMS is looking at some of the new bundling legislation that they have proposed for 2015 as part of [hops] (ph)? Does that meaningfully impact who from a hospital perspective may or may not be included in who is providing data for the 2017 pricing?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. It's a good question, Amanda. Bundled payments in hospital in-patient obviously is a cost for hospitals and therefore when you think about their revenues, as a matter of fact if you look at the language that was in the bill, it says the majority of their Medicare revenues are from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And if you are running a hospital outreach, that’s the majority of your lab revenues to Medicare therefore they should be included. So the bundle side and the in-patient DRG side of hospital in-patient laboratories is part of the cost of doing business of running that hospital. And really what we are looking at is that outreach portion of that should be included because that is the market as we all know.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: And is that still roughly about a third of the hospital market. I think that’s what the data suggested historically in terms of just outreach.
Stephen Rusckowski: It depends on what -- but if you look at the market, it's roughly about 40% of the total market, this hospital outreach.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay.
Stephen Rusckowski: The total market. And the rest is independent laboratories, big and small.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. And then on the molecular, the Tricare and the low Pap pricing situation. I don’t know if I am -- maybe this is a bit of wishful thinking, but have you guys got any sense of whether you might get anything from a retroactive perspective at this point?
Stephen Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. I don’t. I think we have been pretty consistent and we don’t expect any major windfalls from retroactive reimbursement. So even on Tricare, we mentioned that we were getting paid for a portion of Tricare all along for the active military personal. Many of these were covered. It was really for the retirees of the family members. So it's not as if we are getting paid nothing. And so once in a while you may get a windfall, like in 2013 we mentioned there was one state that started reimbursing for cystic fibrosis and it went retroactively back to the beginning of the year. But still you are talking about small millions not anything in the tens of millions or anything that would be materially significant.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby. Sir, your line is open.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, Steve or Mark, just two quick ones. Can you comment at all on the Solstas revenue retention rate and possibly could you size the fuel opportunity year-over-year. What kind of benefit might you see there?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. So first of all, we are pleased with the integration of Solstas, we said that in our introductory comments. We are working nicely through our integration work which we feel good about. As we mentioned, many of these acquisitions we justify the business case based upon cost synergies. And we are integrating Solstas nicely into our operation. We feel good about that. As we make the transition, we have integrated two separate sales forces into one. We feel good that that has happened in an orderly way and in general we are tracking to what our business plan was for that business so far. And as we said, it's accretive along with other acquisitions this quarter. So we feel good about that. And also in the back half we expect that to continue. So, Mark, anything you would like to add?
Mark Guinan: No. I mean as Steve mentioned, we are tracking pretty much on our business case. And as we have shared in the past when we model these kind of acquisitions for conservatism, we do build in some level of attrition in each of these deals because despite of our best efforts to not lose any of those accounts, history has demonstrated that there are various reasons why you will get some attrition. So I would say, right now Bob, like Steve shared, we are pretty much on track to our business case.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And the fuel?
Mark Guinan: You mean fuel for growth in 2015?
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: No, I am sorry. Just gasoline prices being down, it's not a huge opportunity, but...
Mark Guinan: Yes. I mean certainly that’s better news than we would have thought six month ago or so. So, yes, we are still in the process, Bob, and obviously I am not going to talk about any guidance or anything else for 2015. We are still in the process of putting up plans together for 2015. But certainly that’s a good tailwind at least for now since we have a large fleet and certainly that should be helpful.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: We are talking pennies though not dimes, correct?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir, your line is open.
A.J. Rice – UBS Securities: First, just maybe quick, to ask you about your thoughts with respect to share repurchases. Obviously, last year was a year where you took in a lot of proceeds from asset sales and licensing agreements and this year has been one more characterized by acquisitions. Within the context of that, do you have any sort of way to articulate your view on -- update your view on share repurchase and how they fall out in the capital deployment mix?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yes. Well, look, capital deployment commitment is the same. That is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been standing by that. And that will continue. You saw our purchases this quarter, Mark will give you an update on what we have done year-to-date. Also as you know, we feel like share repurchases were heavier in 2012 and 2013 and the acquisitions were heavier in '13. If you look at the two together, it's pretty consistent, pretty good weight based upon the two little heavier acquisitions where we took out the debt. But we stand behind our commitment of returning the majority of our free cash flow and we are tracking well against that and we saw a good cash flow this quarter to support that. So Mark?
Mark Guinan: A.J., for this year, I talked about the need to delever, post the Solstas acquisition. As we mentioned, we paid down $90 million in the most recent quarter. So we do have a commitment to get down closer to the 2.5 rate from a spike of up to 3. We were at it post Summit acquisition. So we have been making it a priority to pay down debt. In terms of what we are going to be doing going forward at the investor day, I am going to talk a little bit about the philosophy and some potential outcomes in terms of paying down further debt or getting to that leverage ratio. And then obviously when we give guidance for 2015, I will get specifically around what our intents would be and...
A.J. Rice – UBS Securities: Okay. And I guess at this point in the call, I'll take the bait and ask you the obligatory question about Theranos. Is there any update that you are seeing in their posture in the marketplace that you would want to share? And I know you've said from time to time you would be open to talking to them if they had any interest in talking to you about what they have and how you might work to collaborate. Any update in any of those areas?
Stephen Rusckowski: No, A.J. No new news on what they are doing in the marketplace. Essentially they are running some pilots in a couple of locations. As a laboratory, again, what they have presented in the past to the market is some disruptive approach to some routinely provided diagnostics. If in fact they have a disruptive technology, we are all for it, listening about that. And one would hope that a company that had something like that would like to talk to one of the largest providers of diagnostic informational services. But no news to share on that other than what you have probably heard and we have said so far.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Most of my questions' answered, so I'll do just one quick one here and let you go. I wanted to talk about restructuring charges for a second and $48 million this quarter over $100 million year-to-date. I guess, presumably the fourth quarter has some assumption about $20 million-$30 million perhaps of excluded charges. I just wanted to understand, what's the glide path over the next couple years as your cost saving programs mature and come to fruition? Are we still looking at hundreds of millions of dollars of one timers to get to that or is there glide path for that diminishes maybe more quickly than that?
Mark Guinan: Yes. So, Gary, I appreciate the question. Really not in a position to comment on the future at this moment. At the investor day we are going to talk about the next stage for Invigorate. And as part of that, we will lay out not just the benefits but also the required investment, both capital and expense. I do want to mention that the adjustments this quarter were not all restructuring. Certainly there was a significant integration and you could imagine with an acquisition the size of Solstas, as we have mentioned it typically takes 18 months to complete that integration. And you might imagine that the first six to nine months is where you have a significant amount of those integration onetime expenses. We did just open up our lab in Marlborough, Massachusetts and with that we are moving out of some other facilities. We did have some one timers there to get into that new facility. And then finally we did have some legal expenses, onetime legal expenses and those adjustments as well. So they are not all restructuring per say. I want to be clear. And there is not -- certainly you should not look at this quarter as kind of being a consistent representation of the kind of expenses that we will be adjusting out going forward. It really depends on all those different factors and what's going on in the business.
Stephen Rusckowski: Any other questions? Okay, if not, as I said in my introductory comments, we had our second solid quarter of top line growth and we continue to build momentum. We are doing a good job executing against our strategy and we look forward to seeing many of you on our Investor Day on November 5th in New York City. So thank you all and talk to you soon.

Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Quest Diagnostics’ Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. At the request of the Company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of this call, including the presentation and question-and-answer-session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead sir, thank you. You may begin.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. This morning what I would is provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through the guidance. This quarter we did restore growth revenues grew 5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2% to $1.8 and then finally cash from operations was strong at $280 million, which is up 34% from 2013. So let me start with the industry trends where actually reimbursement outlook has been improving. First, we saw some signs that healthcare utilization improved during the second quarter. Also in April, the Congress passed so-called doc fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the clinical IP scheduling until 2017. This provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based on a market weighted medium of commercial rates from a broad range of labs, which includes both large and small independent labs as well as hospitals, out reach labs. And it also restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts. And right now we are working through the rule making process. Earlier this month, CMS released the proposal for the 2015 physician fee schedule, that proposal provides a modest improvement from the current fee schedule, which is much needed after the significant cuts experience over the past few years. And then last week we learned that Tricare committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases. Finally, our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do. As we have said diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare. And we are determined to be paid appropriately for the value we provide. We did see continued sequential progress on reimbursement during the quarter. Being appropriately reimbursed for the value provide is critical to our success. We compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price. You’ll hear more about this later in the call from Mark. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, the enrollment through the exchanges ramped up late in the first quarter. While it is still early, we did see modest shifts from the uninsured patient volumes at the certain payer types during the second quarter. We continue to expect that the Affordable Care Act will be neutral to slightly positive for our business in 2014 and net positive over the long run. I would expect to update you further on reviews on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day, which will take place on November 5th in New York City. Now let’s take a look at the progress we are making in executing our five-point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we’ve made in efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are starting to yield positive results. We are seeing continued improvement in sequential trends and revenues, organic volume and organic price. We are seeing continued improvement in sales productivity. We saw a strong revenue growth in several product categories driven by clinical franchises including prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness and infectious disease. In addition, the clinical franchises are positioning us for future growth. What I would like to do is to share a few comments on two partnerships that we established during the quarter. First, we are very pleased to be partnering with Memorial Sloan-Kettering to use molecular testing in next-generation sequencing to improve physicians' capability to treat patients with a variety of solid tumor cancers, which account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year. The goal is to give local community-based oncologists access to these strengths of Quest and Memorial Sloan-Kettering to improve their ability to treat their cancer patients. Initially, physicians who order Quest OncoVantage tumor panel will benefit from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering data through a co- branded clinical annotation report to have access to a patient's prognosis, guide treatment selection, and monitored disease progression. Over time, the goal is to build on this partnership to develop new diagnostic solutions in addition to more research in clinical trials. Second, we also partnered with Sequenom to offer national access to its MaterniT21 PLUS noninvasive prenatal test. Beyond these two collaborations are clinical franchises are also delivering insights from our extensive database to improve health. Let me show you a couple brief examples. You many may have seen that The Wall Street Journal covered our latest health trends report showing that about half of the patients complied with their prescriptions for pain medication. In addition, we continue empower patients to manage their health information through what we call our MyQuest application, which is powered by our Care360 which now has nearly one million users. These are great examples of how we delivering on our vision, of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We are also continuing to focus on opportunities to work collaboratively with hospital systems and integrated delivery networks. Last quarter we announced our fourth professional lab services relationship all these are now operational and generating revenues. Our pipeline of new opportunities continues to expand in this area. Additionally, our M&A program enable us to restore growth in the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Summit Health to bolster our growing wellness business. We also completed the acquisition of Steward Health's outreach business and made progress on Solstas integration. In total acquisitions added approximately 7% of revenues during the quarter and also is better way for us to add some very talented people to the organization.  We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made the number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our two new national operation centers; one in Kansas and one in Tampa, to enhance extend customer services for clients and employees throughout the United States. We have added jobs in each of these markets and put in state-of-the-art technology to enable these teams to deliver a superior customer experience. We also began moving into our new state-of-the-art facility of Marlborough, Massachusetts, which we use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England healthcare community. And finally overall, our Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. We planned to provide you additional details on our plans to not just meet, but also exceed our long-term goal of $1 billion in cost savings at our Investor Day later this fall. The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence. A simplified strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign it also includes organizational capabilities, culture, and processes. We continue to imbed capabilities in our organization aimed at building a high performance culture and we’ve been driving transformational change for about 18-months and we have made a lot of progress, but this type of work as you all know actually takes time and we’re still in the early stages of the process. We have strengthened capabilities in our management ranks and also we’re building capabilities on our Board. We’ve recently welcomed Vicky Gregg as a new director. She recently retired as CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee. She also has held a series of senior roles at Humana and serves on the board of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Her healthcare intern perspective and also her deep experience in healthcare information technology will strengthen our board. Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information service business. We generated $200 million of cash from operations in the quarter which reflects progress in our approach to delivering and managing working capital. Inline with our plan we made investments in our business, made two acquisitions and continue to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Well we’re on-track to meet our commitments for 2014. Now Mark will provide you with an overview on our second quarter financial performance and update you on our latest view on guidance. Mark.
Mark J. Guinan: Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 4.8% ahead of the prior year. Our diagnostic information services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues grew by 5.3% compared to the prior year. Revenue per acquisition in Q2 was down 2.3% compared to the prior year. The impact of recent requisition negatively impacted revenue per requisition by approximately 1%. The remainder is attributed to changes in our business mix and price erosion. Pure price erosion was less than 1% in the quarter; we recognized that price erosion has been a challenge for our business; we will remain focused on receiving appropriate reimbursement for the value that we provide. Part of my focus will be on ensuring a disciplined approach to pricing and along those lines we will and have already begun to make prudent portfolio decisions as we move forward. Volume for the quarter was 7.7% favorable to the prior year; recent acquisitions added approximately 8.5% to volumes. As I mentioned, we have already begun to make prudent decisions regarding pricing, and in some cases that means walking away from existing business. During the quarter, such decisions reduced our underlying volumes by approximately 1%, excluding acquisitions and these deliberate portfolio decisions, our underlying volumes were slightly favorable in the quarter compared to a year-ago. Again, we are making sequential improvement on volumes. Q2 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses were down 1.1% compared to the prior year, the decline is entirely due to the divestiture of Interex last year, excluding the impact of this divestiture our diagnostic solutions business would have improved by approximately 1%. Adjusted operating income at 15.5% of revenues was about 1.4% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to reimbursement pressure and recent acquisitions which carry lower initial operating margins. Of note, this was the first full quarter of integration for Solstas. As we shared previously, we expected Solstas to be dilutive in the first half of the year, given the magnitude of that business and the fact that we haven’t yet fully realized the synergies, it had an impact on our margins, we estimate that Solstas eroded our margins by more than 50 basis points during the second quarter. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our Invigorate program which offset increases in our wage bill as well as price erosions. As we indicated on our last call we continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run-rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion overtime. Adjusted EPS of $1.84 was 1.9% better than a year-ago, as a result of the company’s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $34 million principally restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1.7% and reported EPS by $0.16. Last year’s second quarter included $19 million of cost associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1%, and reported EPS by $0.07. As expected bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved 40 basis points from the prior quarter an increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 3.9%. Our DSOs improved by two days from last quarter to 47 days. Cash from operations was $280 million in the quarter, compared to $208 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $57.74. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As well as meet our debt repayment commitments which we discussed on the last call. Turning to guidance, we expect full-year 2014 results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2.5% to 3.5% compared to a year ago, versus prior guidance of an increased of 2% to 4% compared to a year ago, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.10, compared to prior guidance of $3.95 to $4.15. Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million. We took another positive step forward to restoring growth this quarter and continue to make nice progress against our integrate targets. With that in mind we remain committed to providing guidance that is realistic and achievable. Finally, I would like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement certain commercial contracts will anniversary later this year. On volumes we anticipate that are focused on pricing discipline will create some additional headwinds that will continue through the remainder of the year. Ensuring that we are paid appropriately for the value we provide will enable us to build value over the long run. Regarding acquisitions you should assumes Solstas will continue to benefit our revenues in the back half of the year by approximately 5%. But also keep in mind that we have two acquisitions, Dignity Health and ATN, that anniversaried in the second quarter. With that said, we expect our recent acquisitions to begin the benefit EPS gradually through the year as we realized synergies. As a result of these items we now expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be better than the 2013 level and closely approximate our second quarter performance. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. So to summarize we restored growth in the quarter. Trends improved across the Board and pricing, volume and revenue we continue to make good progress executing our strategy and have more to do. And then finally, we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014. Now, we would be happy to take any of your questions, operator.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Lisa Gill. Thank you your line is open.
Gavin S. Weiss – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thank you, this is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. So you talked about seeing some positive benefit from ACA volumes and I just wanted to get some more color on what type of payer mix you are seeing there. I assume it would be Medicaid, but can you talk about how that is impacting revenue per requisition and the profitability on those tests.
Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Sure, thanks Lisa, first of all, your guess on that is correct and we did see an increase in Medicaid activity in volume in the quarter and we are trying to track this, as I said in my remarks it is early. We’re trying to understand the ins and outs so what’s happening with our volume and where the lives are going. So and we trying to market down to go growth the revenue per req effect as well because there is a mix change here as well.
Mark J. Guinan: At this point, Lisa, it is still early there is small changes, I wouldn’t say there was anything material enough to impact revenue req in a quantifiable fashion. As Steve mentioned we saw some increase in Medicaid though not in all of the states that you would have expected. So it still is early and we also saw a slight decrease in our uninsured volumes. So there are some early signs of the ACA, but certainly not anything material enough to give you the kind of depth that you are probably looking for at this point.
Gavin S. Weiss – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that is actually helpful. And then in terms of the business that you are walking away from that is not profitable, is there a specific type of test or is it certain payers that you are walking away from?
Mark J. Guinan: It is more of the client bill area so we have some client bill accounts where as we look at it we’ve decided like you do in your products portfolio and other things as we have to make business decision around how we create value that it doesn’t make sense continuing with those clients. So we understand and agree that there should be a lot of focus on volumes, but also want to make sure people understand not all volumes creased equal, and just like we needed to reshape our portfolio along our products and business we also need to do some clean-up of our portfolio around our customer base.
Gavin S. Weiss – JP Morgan Securities LLC: Okay great, thank you very much.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So we've also taken a look Lisa, some of our practices and a variety of our businesses and pathology will be a good example, we are just taking a look at some of the practice has given a substantial changes that’s we've had a reimbursement as you know in the last year and made deliberate choices to reduce some in some areas that we thought were not the best interest of building value overtime. So that’s what we are referring to in our remarks.
Gavin S. Weiss – JP Morgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Brett Jones. Your line is open.
Bret Jones – Oppenheimer & Co: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Hey Bret.
Bret Jones – Oppenheimer & Co: I wanted to start with the organic price comment where you said you saw some organic price improvement, was that primarily a managed care contract which to me sound like they were going to anniversary in second half or was that really around the client bill as you were talking about walking away from clients?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so we saw a sequential improvement in what we define as real price erosion and so sequential improvement is the decline and our price erosion is better in the second quarter versus Q1. We've indicated going into the year, we expected to have less price erosion in 2014 than we experienced in 2013, we’re still standing behind the guidance, we provided it in the fall of 2012 which that on a – we believe our price erosion over a three year period would be 1% to 2% and we feel good now that in fact what we believe would happen is happening and we have reasonable visibility. So I’ll turn it to again Mark and Dan to give a little more color on exactly what's happened with the price erosion in the quarter.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes and just to build on what Steve shared, right the price erosion we are looking at it from a sequential perspective some things anniversaried was a good example, sequestration which I think we all knew is going to anniversary at April 1, so the year-over-year comparisons are getting better, now less than 1% if you thought about it more from an absolute basis on a sequential basis revenue per acquisition is inline with what it had been running at, but that year-over-year comparison is getting better.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes and just on your question about the customer portfolio decisions we would not capture that in price, that would be in mix, so any decision to move away from certain business would be in the revenue per rack mix rate are not in the price calculation.
Bret Jones – Oppenheimer & Co: All right great that’s helpful. On volumes, is there anyway to tell if there was a rebound of volumes due to weather that you saw in the first quarter, were there regions that were hit hard in Q1 that were especially strong this quarter?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, you know that’s a great question and its something that we constantly ask ourselves is when weather happens is it’s a deferral or is it actually a reduction and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest that Q2 benefitted greatly from the decline in Q1 and we picked that up. I really think as we look at the quarter, we feel it’s a true run rate of demand in that quarter versus being some sort of the pick up from that depression in Q1 and a lot of that Q1 weather happens fairly early, some was January, some was February but March wasn’t all that bad of a weather month. So you would have expected probably if you got some pickup, it may have been in March.
Bret Jones – Oppenheimer & Co:  Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Willoughby.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning Bob.
Mark J. Guinan: Good morning Bob.
Robert M. Willoughby – Bank of America – Merrill Lynch:  brought the high end of the revenue range down despite a pretty healthy beat here on the second quarter. Can you give us any indicator as to what kind of fell out of the high end of the expectation there?
Mark J. Guinan:  Bob, you got cut off in the beginning, could you repeat your question please?
Robert M. Willoughby – Bank of America – Merrill Lynch:  Yes, you had a healthy revenue beat here in the second quarter, yet you brought that revenue range, the high end of the range down for the year. Was there anything in particular that kind of fell out of your expectation for the year?
Mark J. Guinan:  No, Bob as you know that the beat was against external I guess projections, not necessarily against what we were expecting. So I mean we feel pretty about Q2, it’s pretty much on plan and I think your take away should be based on the updated guidance. What we’re really same as the year tracking as expected obviously we had some disruption in the first quarter with the weather, but once we've gotten beyond that we feel like we’re on-track to the guidance at the beginning of the year and we’re comfortable and therefore we’re hoping you will confident that things are looking good. So I wouldn’t read too much quote into the beat in the first quarter, we really pretty much we landed right about where we expected which is good.
Robert M. Willoughby – Bank of America – Merrill Lynch:  Okay. And you referenced possibly exceeding the $1 billion of cost savings numbers here and I just kind of compare that with the comment that you are walking away from some business that is poorly price or that isn't paying you well. We've heard about that since about the mid-90s for the lab companies. I’m always amazed that this business finds its way into your portfolio. And if you are cutting the cost as dramatically as you can, why aren't retaining that business or frankly, poised to grow faster here if those cost savings do come through?
Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Yes. So we’re doing this is in a prudent way Bob. There are some business they obviously might've been on the margin in the past; because of the strong cost improvements it’s still highly attractive for us so to your point we’re looking at this in a rigorous way. But at the same time, we transact a lot of activity in a variety of businesses and so what we are making sure we do is prudently go through our business portfolio by regions and price appropriately. And in some cases, if we decided to, decide that is not the best interest to continue with the client. So that’s what we are doing. But our price opportunities along with the opportunities to retain business have been helped as you’re pointing out, with our Invigorate program. We are ahead of our plan. The initial goal was $500 million. We increased it in the fall of 2012 to $600 million. We have said this year that is going to approximate $700 million. We are teeing up or share with you a glimpse of the future. We see actually more opportunity, so we are deliberately going after that to make sure that we are stay in the marketplace is aggressively as possible and make money and build value as much as we can.
Mark J. Guinan: And Bob as you know not all volumes created equal and it’s both on the revenue and the cost side, so the difference between a capitated payment and a fee-for-service arrangement can be dramatic. The other thing is the cost to serve can very dramatically depending on the what kind of payer situation it is, whether it’s in bad debt or it’s in billing or it is in logistics. So, I think what we are doing as we are doing a detailed rationalization to try to figure out, where we can create shareholder value and focused and then some other areas where maybe where better half moving our focus away from that business. So that’s what we are talking not given up on volume growth, this is kind of a short-term get the portfolio right and then really focus from that new based going forward.
Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch:  Mark, what is a reasonable share repurchase assumption for the second half?
Mark J. Guinan: As I’ve said previously, with our $900 million of guided operating cash flow and $300 million of capital spend is about 600 free cash flow and that we’re committed to returning a majority to our shareholders. Now we’ve done a couple of acquisitions that we are funded out of our operating cash flow most recently Summit and Stewart. And then I also have a commitment to repaying some of the debt we took on incrementally for Solstas. So, at this point, what I’ve really talked about is doing enough share repurchases to prevent dilution and not gotten specific, but certainly with our dividend a little less than $200 million and our commitment to delivering at least half of our free cash flow. You can back into something north of $100 million in share repurchases, but I’ve said we’re going to do anything near the level we did in 2013 and probably not significantly more than just preventing dilution.
Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line open.
Isaac Ro – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Good morning. Thank you guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Hey Isaac.
Isaac Ro – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So on the ACA I know we are obviously still early stages trying to figure out all the moving parts, but I would be curious if you could may be try and tie in the impact that you got from ACA relative to the trends that you saw in bad debt. Was there a direct benefit to bad debt, because of the ACA coverage?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: No. On bad debt again I don’t think the movement yet is significant enough for you to see it, its less than rounding at this point, so it very, very early. When I look at bad debt historically there is a seasonal variation as you are very aware so as you progress throughout the year you expect some sequential improvement. We referenced that. In terms of the year-over-year increase on bad debt, it actually was driven really by Solstas. So we took on a business that had a higher bad debt rate than our rate and we consider ourselves and I’m sure you look at the numbers to be one of the best-in-class, if not best-in-class. And part of those synergies we are going to drive to the Solstas business is improving the rate of bad debt. So initially that mix drove it up a little bit, but if you look at the core organic bad debt, the work that we are doing on improving that area and some of that is within Invigorate, really that organic business bad debt rate would have been down as a percent of revenue year-over-year.
Isaac Ro – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That was helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: But really through our effort and our work, not through the benefit of ACA.
Isaac Ro – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on your cost savings targets. You guys raised the goals there, but I don't think we got a lot of color on exactly, first of all, where you expect those cost savings to come from. And then secondly, if you could maybe venture if in fact the pricing and volume environment tracks in line with your expectations, what kind of a margin benefit we should expect from these incremental savings over the next couple years. Thank you.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes, so thank Isaac so we’ll provide you more color on this at our Investor Day in November, as we said in New York so hopefully you will be there for that. You should expect that we’ll get out of the new forward looking goal is a continuation of some of the work we already have done. We have more opportunities to do more work related to the streams we have talked about before, what we do around procurement, what we do around functional excellence, what we are doing around just across the board looking at improvement opportunities and how we do our work in all the different complicated areas of our operations. So some of it’s a continuation, but I have shared in the past as a matter of fact we shared it at our first Investor Day in 2012. Is that there will be a second tranche of improvement that we see an opportunity to really take a harder look at re-engineering our processes, streamlining activities and then enabling them with the right IT to allow us to get to the next level and that’s what we are going to provide more color in November Investor Day, and that’s where a second piece of the improvement we see will come from.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it guys, thanks so much. See you in November.
Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Massaro. Sir, your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning, Mark.
Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you.
Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.: So you had a nice job lifting the volumes organically on a sequential basis. Could you help us kind of walk through when you see that kind of more meaningfully lifting? And I know you talked about certain aspects that helped your organic volumes, but could you maybe just walk through what you think some of the largest contributors to that would be? 
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah. Sure so if you go through and think about what we’re doing as far as, our strategy for restoring growth, first improvement we’re gradually same and you have to see the sequential is what we’re doing about our sales force last year, we actually we put in place in organizational structure we put in place better tools we’re build the capabilities to that organization and we feel much better today that we did year ago whether go to market organization we started to see some results from that. On that across the board that we have a very comprehensive salesforce. They call on primary care physicians they call on the variety of specialty areas that we call on. They call on hospitals. They call on integrated delivery networks and across the board we’re much stronger today then in the past. And in the service business as you know Mark this takes time and you gradually get new accounts and we’re starting to see some of that in what we called sales productivity. Second is part of our change as a company as we create a clinical franchises, we actually made modest investments in those clinical franchises which is a lot of to introduce products and solutions in a different way than we’ve ever done before probably the most notable example of that is what we have done with BRCA which we introduced in the fall of last year, it’s a good example. We are bringing solutions to the marketplace and then commercialize and then in selling those in a much better way then ever before and so we’re seeing improvement in our volumes from those solutions start to take hold as we sell this solutions in the marketplace. And then third, as we have built laboratory professional services business and I’ve said in my introductory comments that is building momentum, we announced in the first quarter that we had four deals that were operational and we are executing against those I will share you that we have significant conversations going on with significant systems throughout the United States. I’m often in front of hospital CEOs and integrated network CEOs and hospital chain CEOs about what we can do to help them with their lab strategy and how we can partner. And that’s helping so the sequential improvement we saw as well in the second quarter. So all three had opportunity improvement we are seeing and that will continue to help us as we go into the second half. So let me pause there. Anything else, Mark, you would like to add to that?
Mark J. Guinan: Yeah, I think you recognize that when you look at the overall growth rate really what it is, is mathematical calculation of many sub businesses that are growing in our some cases declining and when you look some of the drivers that have been headwinds for us over last several of quarters, we felt utilization was certainly an issue. So the marketplace overall was down and we are starting to see some positive signs. Again, we have imperfect information like you, we look at many things hospital admissions, physician officers and some of you look at scripts.. And what we have started to do is look at what we call same-store sales are equivalent when we look at accounts that have some sort of stability. So that not accounts where either dramatically they are up and down, which is probably driven by changes in membership or something like that and try to look at the overall volume year-over-year to get a field for how is utilization, how is the market. And as we look at that it looks like we have some stability maybe some slight growth and certainly not the decline that we felt like we experience last year. So that’s one of the drivers certainly that we feel the market it is improving and we all hope that the ACA will accelerate that if anything. The other to get when we had obviously is in area Paps guidance. Guideline change is really impact to that that’s not gotten completely behind us that’s been a major headwind for us. But on the other hand, the guideline change in the industry it doesn’t be offset the path guidelines certainly is a tailwind. We talked about our prescription drug monitoring business being the growth engine or wellness business to being the growth engine certainly in the tox area we are seeing some uplift. And then certainly in the gene-based areas, most notably our BRCA business we are seeing growth. So, when you look at the mix that’s where we are feeling optimistic about a growth and volumes moving forward.
Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.:  Thanks. Just one quick follow-up. You mentioned prescription drug monitoring. Do you know what your drugs of abuse volumes were in the quarter and do you think that that could accelerate going forward?
Mark J. Guinan:  We did see a nice growth in the drug abused area this quarter. I believe overall at least near double-digit growth for the quarter to having provided any guidance relate to that business going forward though.
Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.: Great, thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning A.J.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC:  Hi, thanks. Hi everyone. Maybe just to ask a little bit more about the comment you made on being pleased that Tricare has come out with this announcement. Have you had any feedback from them as to when you actually might start seeing some payments from them or whether confirmation on the comments about retroactive catch ups and Then I guess I would broaden that out and my sense is there are some states that have been dragging their feet on paying for some of the molecular diagnostic testing. Have you had any positive discussions there? Maybe just some update on that general area.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Dan do you want to handle that?
Dan Haemmerle:  Yes. Sure. A.J., thanks for the question on Tricare. First part of your question was related to when we’ll see payments and any details related to the retro. Don't have a lot of detail on that front so it’s a little bit of wait and see. We are having dialogue on that front though and working with the trade association and as soon as we know we will be sure to talk more about it. We would say, though that on Tricare and molecular coding we have seen some reimbursement in the past on certain codes. So when we do see some lift, we expect to see some lift but keep in mind we have seen some payment for some testing. With respect to different states we're seeing some progress and we saw some progress last year with different states and I think couple of states that had not been paying specific tests. One state in particular was not paying cystic fibrosis testing for all of their population. So they have put some edits around that so we continue to work through that with different states, but it’s one at a time and we continue to have dialogue and hope to get to a better place than we are today.
A.J. Rice – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay. And then maybe just broadly re-contracting. You are talking about some of the things you are doing proactively on price. But can you just remind us, are you pretty much done with the major contracts that need to be renewed for this year, however you define major? Are there any opportunities out there that you are bidding on that may be things that you could potentially pick up?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, hundreds of contracts out there so it’s just only some level of dialogue going on in terms of major contract we shared earlier this year that we did renegotiate and extend our relationship with Humana is the major contract that we spoke into.
Mark J. Guinan:  And A.J, we look as Steve said earlier, we feel very comfortable with the guidance we've given on price the 1%, 2% over the three year period of time which obviously implied something lower and this year and next year given the 3% that we experienced in 2013. So we certainly have contemplated all of the contracts we need to renegotiate the other thing is at the last call I mentioned and we reaffirm that I expected peer price erosion to mitigate and decline throughout the year. So hopefully that will give you an envelope for confidence and where price might play out for the balance of the year.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC:  Okay, great thanks a lot.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning, Gary.
Mark J. Guinan: Good morning, Gary.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.:  Couple of question one we’ve been hearing about some pretty significant Aetna out-of-network lab cuts and some renewed efforts to on the doc fix side and I wondered if you had seen any benefit from that or expected to.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: First of all we don’t comment on specific relationships we have, but we are working proactively with Aetna. As you know we are their national provider for lab services and they have an ongoing active program to drive as much volume into our business as possible, given what we offer in terms of value to them. So we feel good about that and they are helping us making sure that we do the right thing for their membership. Would you like to share anything beyond that in.
Dan Haemmerle:  Gary, not sure exactly which price points you are referring to. I did see some trade publication to put some news out there I think it was limited to non-contracted providers and certain sub-specialties and certain smaller geographies is our understanding on some of what we had read on some of those cuts. So the pricing that was out there, to the extent people had a question about, did not impact us, but was pretty limited from our understanding. 
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.: Right. Second question, I think people tried to dig into this a little bit. I am just going to ask it a little bit different. I had followed Mark's comments kind of walking through the total volume and the acquisition impact and then the deliberate contract exits to getting to a statement where organic volume was up slightly year-over-year, which is certainly better. What do you guys think when you see a Labcorp reporting a plus 3 organic volume number? Certainly part of that answer is probably mix of services, but what does is that make you think about just kind of how you are performing in the marketplace and share gains, share loss? Or do you think that is purely a mix differential driving the apparent reported difference?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah, so I appreciate the question Gary, obviously not going to comment on anybody else, so I will talk about how we think we are doing. The other thing to notice not everyone calculates organic volume consistently and I am sure you guys work to try to tease that out and get an apples-and-apples comparison. So when we offer up organic volume, it is true organic volume. We don't make any exceptions no matter the size of the deal, so you can feel comfortable that when we call it organic it is organic. In terms of share, it is very difficult because of the lack of market data. So as I mentioned, one of things that we are really trying to figure out ourselves is how is the market growing and to both assess ourselves how we are doing and also be able to share with you. When we have started to look at, what I mentioned was kind of our same account sales levels. But there is also mix differential, so some of the businesses that have been impacted by guideline changes and by other changes in demographics might disproportionately impacted various labs and providers differently. And as we have mentioned in the past, we have the largest pathology business and certainly those pathology cuts disproportionately impacted us. So we don't think we are losing share overall. Obviously the national labs and even independent labs have a sub-segment. There is an awful lot of providers out there, including hospital outreach, so it is kind of hard to just look at the small segment and the national labs and look at each of those two and determine where the share might be coming from, if there are share changes and differential. So not trying to be evasive, but it is a very difficult question to answer, and I think the best answer I can give you as we don't feel like we are losing share. We feel like last year a lot of impact was utilization in the market and some of the impacts that were driven by the guideline changes and by the pathology business being really hit by those cuts and that this year we are starting to recover some of that. So that’s kind of how we view our performance. And as we committed, we want to return to growth. And as several people have noted and as we have said, we are not there yet but we feel like we are making progress.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah, so let me just add to that. So, we feel good now that we are making sequential improvement and in our services business it builds. What he outlined is what we are doing to restore growth has started to show its merits so step-by-step we will see progress. As we have said, it is complicated when you look at the volumes. We had noted that we actually took some actions that affected that. When you adjust for that we saw a slight improvement in organic volumes and that is an improvement versus the prior quarter, which is good. I will also share with you that we noted some clinical franchises that are growing, but if you look at broadly when we take a look at our volumes for gene-based and esoteric testing it did grow. We already talked about drug of abuse growing. And even when you look at the routine volumes, and some of it gets back to Mark's comment about the same account or same-store analysis we do, we actually have started to see some improvement in that as well. The other thing that we need to think about so there is continued to have softness in TAP volumes given the guideline changes that have been in place for a few years now. And we continue to see softness in TAP volumes what offsets these improvements we see in the big areas that we are focused on, genetic testing and then the core platform business of what we called routine. So across the board we feel good about the progress made in the quarter. We are building on all the work that we have done in the past and we have more opportunities in front of us. And it’s a big market out there, so we focus on the entire market. We compete with hospital outreach, we compete with regional labs. We compete with many laboratory providers. So when we look broadly at this industry we think there is plenty of opportunity to grow in this market. We are focused on the right areas that are growing and we will continue to restore growth as we go forward. And I think this quarter is a good example as we are proving that we are showing sequential improvement this quarter and we will show more sequential improvement as we go forward.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Sure. That is a pretty comprehensive answer, so I appreciate that. One last quick question for me. Certainly you have achieved some success in the cost cutting. You can look at either COGS or G&A per a session and see that is declining over the last couple of years. But along with that obviously you have had to spend a fair amount on restructuring and integration. Just quick count, I think roughly $115 million in 2012 and 2013 and on pace for over $100 million of restructuring charges this year, so there is kind of $0.40, $0.50 of earnings impact that we have routinely been excluding from normalized results. So the question was just do you have some visibility? I know Invigorate is expected to continue in the next few years. Do you have some visibility on the trajectory of the restructuring and the integration expense?
Mark J. Guinan: We will quantify that to some extent in the Investor Day. So, certainly as we are developing our detailed plans that we are intending to share last this year and obviously start implementing, we are looking at the savings side but obviously we are also quantifying the investment. So we certainly will be sharing that later this year.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I will just add that one of the strategies of our five-point strategy is to deliver on disciplined capital deployment. And so any place we put money on the table we, and Mark and I in particular look through the business case that justifies it. That is included in what we do around capital investments, it includes what we do around Invigorate savings, and it also includes, as you would expect, a business case that will give us good shareholder return for any acquisitions we will do. So everything is well underpinned with good returns based upon the goals that we have for the company.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Okay. I will wait for some more detail on that, thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you.
Mark J. Guinan: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Lieberman. Sir your line open.
Mark J. Guinan:  Good morning Gary.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned hospital outreach in part of the answer to the last question. Could you maybe characterize the overall hospital outreach environment? Are hospitals increasingly getting to the business? Are the managed care payers doing anything incremental to try to steer physician volumes away from the hospitals and to you guys?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so Gary its interesting, and the reason why we are so optimistic about our dialogue with the hospitals and its great delivery networks and hospital chains is, as we thought what happened as there become a larger patients responsibility with high-deductible client when we have. And patients are starting to look at their out-of-pocket cost and then with the dynamic of physicians joining integrated delivery networks and as we all know in the past two or three years some portions of our volume has moved to hospital outreach and as we all know their prices in the industry, their commercial rates are higher than ours. Its drawing some attention from patients, from physician and also the systems are evaluation is this going to be sustainable. So we have engaged with many different system you see one lab strategy, you see one lab strategy, in some cases they decided to rely on us for those service. So we bought University of Massachusetts, we bought Dignity Health, then we bought Steward Outreach. Examples were in fact they decided that’s in the best interest to rely on us as Quest to provide them with their laboratory services.  So I would say that the momentum on that topic continues to build and I think the strongest dynamic that’s helping force this is transparency around price, and the patients starting to feel the impact of price increases because of decisions that have been made in the health care system and the most notable is they are going to a physician for number of years, their physicians sold their practice to a hospital and lo and behold instead coming place, coming to Quest with some of the great value we offer. They get told to go to the laboratory inside the hospital and what they find is a much bigger bill than they had in the past and they have to pay for it themselves. So this is getting back to the systems and getting back to the physicians and in general that’s starting to turn and that’s part of our dialogue with these systems.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, thank you. Then I guess just going back to your comments in terms of the business that you exited. It wasn't clear if there was sort of a characteristic that applied to that business. Was it more fee for service, was it more capitated? Maybe a little bit more color on it.
Mark J. Guinan:  Yes. Actually you are correct I didn’t provide that so all I said was it’s in the client bill area but really didn’t provide any more on that I’m not going to get into any more detail.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Then maybe finally if you could just give us some color on the progress you are making with BRCA and maybe any challenges or early successes there?
Mark J. Guinan:  Yes. First of all, we are encouraged. We keep on building. We introduce the products as you know in the fall last year. We think there is a tremendous market in front of us. We have a compelling value proposition. We have good reach with our channels. We are putting in place even more comprehensive salesforce to go at the market, getting to the right call points, we feel good about commercial contracts that we have. So encouraged by the progress we made and also this is a part of where we expect to get some growth in the second half. 
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Mark J. Guinan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen. Your line is open.
Nicholas M. Jansen – Raymond James & Associates:  Hey. Quick question regarding your net cost savings year over year. Did you provide that? And if I missed it, I apologize. But I'm just trying to get a sense of adjusted EBIT was down about $12 million year over year. I know about half of that is higher bad debt. You acquired Solstas and a couple of other acquisitions over the trailing 12 months, so I am just trying to get a sense of how much the underlying business is down when we normalize for the cost-cutting savings? Thanks.
Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Dan do you want to answer it?
Dan Haemmerle:  Yes, we didn’t provide that reconciliation. And just to remind you that we also have a cost headwind this year that we mentioned going into the year, which is really restoring our management incentive accruals at this point with the hope and expectation that we are going to achieve our objectives. Last year, unfortunately, given the year, we ended up not spending a lot in that area and so that was a headwind this year. Certainly don't take the margin change as being an indication that Invigorate is not delivering its cost savings. It is just that this year, as we mentioned upfront, there were a couple of things in addition to the wage increase, the annual low single-digit wage increase that we give, and then the price erosion we also had this management incentive headwind.
Nicholas M. Jansen – Raymond James & Associates: Okay, that is helpful. And maybe just kind of a broader speaking question. Maybe this is an analyst day type question, but are you guys able to grow EBIT when rev per req is flat to down? Is it too much of an uphill battle given cost inflation? I'm just trying to get a sense of, if there was no cost-cutting programs going on, would this be an industry that can grow EBIT if test mix and payer mix remain under pressure from a rev per req standpoint. Thanks.
Dan Haemmerle:  Yes. Appreciate the question and we will provide a little more color on the industry and what is going on with our margins going forward. The interesting part of the revenue per req calculation is that it is an interesting aggregation of a lot of different aspects of our business. We do provide visibility on what we call our price erosion where we try to freeze all variables and say what is the real price change year on year related to commercial contracts and what we are getting from CMS. And that is one aspect. As you know, there is other aspects. There is payer mix, there is business mix, there is geographic mix. You put that all together, so when you look at revenue per req you get some – you can draw some conclusions that aren't necessarily the conclusions that are quite clear directly related to margins. You can actually have a high revenue direct business that has low margins and you can have a lower revenue per req business that has high margins. And so it is an industry metric that we have used and there is a lot of variables within it and we have seen a decline in it, but I think going forward, as we think about describing where we are going to get our margin lift, we also need to talk about the real margins embedded in a variety of businesses, geographies, payers as we go forward. Mark, would you like to share any more around that?
Mark J. Guinan: I think you have captured it well Steve, which I understand why revenue per req is used as a proxy for profitability and margin, but to Steve's point, it is not true in all cases and actually, as we have talked about some of the mix impact, that should not be deemed to be a hit to profitability. We have done some acquisitions in the past, including one about a year ago, that had a lower revenue per req but is quite profitable. Again, I know you guys have less than perfect information but don't always take revenue per req, either an increase or a decrease, as necessarily an indicator of an increase or decrease in profitability. There is more to it than that.
Nicholas M. Jansen – Raymond James & Associates:  Thanks for the details guys.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Amanda Murphy. Thank you, Ms. Murphy, your line is open/ 
Amanda L. Murphy – William Blair & Company LLC:  Hey, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up to something you mentioned earlier on the pathology side. So I’m just curious; it sounds like maybe that is becoming a benefit for you just given some of the reimbursement challenges there. So, I guess I'm curious, just given the exposure you have to AmeriPath, is that something that could become a more meaningful tailwind for you going forward? And then just how are you thinking about that market from an M&A perspective now?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks for the question. First of all, with all the reimbursement cuts that we saw last year in pathology we have gotten a lot of questions about does this help you. And I would say this: we haven't seen a meaningful change in hospitals systems thinking about potentially outsourcing or redirecting some of their work. Second is, we do characterize our Pap volumes as part of our AP business and pathology business. As you know, Pap continues to decline. I mentioned that as part of the offset to some nice growth we saw in some product categories and categories of our testing. So Paps, given the guideline changes, continue to decline. We haven’t bottomed out yet in terms of Pap volumes based upon the new cycling of when those exams should happen. So I would say, Amanda, overall we haven’t seen anything meaningful yet but we are watching it because the reimbursement changes were significant. It is a clearly different business and it is in the area that we do see and we expect nice growth, which is in our whole oncology and clinical franchise. And so, therefore, in the future there will be more volume related to the tissue business and we expect that that would be a nice opportunity for us to take advantage. But the example that we brought up brought up of working with Memorial Sloan Kettering is a great example. We are trying to leverage our presence in pathology, leverage that over to genetics and also molecular diagnostics to really have an effect on oncology and cancer care. And we think that is promising as we go forward, but in the short run we haven’t seen a notable change.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair & Company: Got it, okay. And then just a question on the Medicare side. Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty just in terms of how they might implement the private-pay side of things going forward, and you mentioned a bit about this. But how do you think about this in terms of how it impacts Quest and the larger labs? What are the puts and takes there and how should we – I guess what should we be looking for from an investor perspective about how you guys might be positioned long-term in Medicare reimbursement?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, right in the middle of what we are calling – what they call the rule-making process. And I will share will share with you the trade association that I am now the chair of is actively engaged in this, so I will tell you my colleagues that sit on the Board with me are also very active engaging in this, I feel very good about we are doing as a trade association to make sure that we are quite involved and how they will eventually develop which will be a median market-based price approach to the clinical lab fee schedule. So rule-making is happening as we speak. They eventually do the sampling in 2016 to reevaluate codes in 2017. To support this as a trade association we actually had a third-party do a sampling of the marketplace, which goes back to the wide variation we have around prices in this industry. In fact, what we showed for a variety of codes that CMS pays for, but if you look at the wide variation they include hospital outreach, which is the highest price, and then you have large nationals, like ourselves, which are, in most cases, some of the lowest prices have best value in this industry. CMS is actually in the middle of the fairway from that early sample that we did. So we have to do the rule-making first. We want to make sure we have a representative sample of the market which will include large players like ourselves at our nearest competitor. Second is regional players, and then finally outreach. And we have had public hearings on this. We are doing our fair share of lobbing to make sure that we approach it with realistic pragmatic sampling technique that has a true representative sample of the market, and that will gather that data. In some cases, yes there might be some market adjustments done, we don’t until we get the data but actually in some case we believe that we are under reimbursed by CMS, and that’s the facts demonstrate this. There might be some modest increases as well. So we are in the middle of the process we feel good about that we are going to make sure it’s done in the right way or trying to help CMS come up at the right approach. We will get the sampling done in 2016 and then we will see how that affects the clinical lab fee schedule in 2017. So that’s where we are? But we are on top of it and we think its good approach that were active engaged.
Amanda L. Murphy – William Blair & Company LLC:  Okay, thanks very much.

Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.
Dan Haemmerle:  Thank you and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10‐K and Current Reports on Form 8‐K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on our website. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning what I would like to do is walk you through the industry dynamics, talk about the impact harsh winter on the quarter and review progress against our five-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and walk you through the guidance.  So let's start with the industry dynamics and the legislative dynamics in particular. As you know our industry has been facing unprecedented reimbursement challenges from the government from a long history of reimbursement cuts. The new provisions of what's called the Doc Fix Legislation that related to the clinical fee schedule remove a dark cloud that was hanging over our industry. This legislation gives us an outcome that is much preferable to earlier government proposals. What is does is it delays adjustments to the clinical out fees schedule until 2017. It provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based upon a market weighted medium of commercial rates for abroad or in laboratories and importantly it restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts. I look forward at working on this with our trade association, particularly in my new role as Chairman. Now there's been questions about the pricing mechanisms in the legislation, and let me provide some clarity to that.  First, this needs to be top defined through the role making process, but it's designed to be representative of the entire commercial laboratory market. The legislation includes hospitals, out reach laboratories and independent laboratories. The laboratory industry agrees that everyone benefits from including a broad spectrum of providers in the network.  Now beyond the recent legislation we continue to believe the affordable care act will be net positive for the industry. In the near term we expected it to be neutral to slightly positive for Quest in 2014. The enrolment process was in line with our expectations, that is bumpy roll-out followed by a late surge near the deadline, and we believe that going into the second half will see some impact, but again neutral to slightly positive.  As we all know this was an unusually harsh winter in many parts of the country. And this had a significant impact on many businesses. During the quarter we estimate that the harsh winter reduced our revenues by 2% and EPS by $0.11. At this winter and more like last year revenues would have been essentially flat to the prior year and EPS would have been favourable to 2013.  We saw signs of continued stabilization in the underlying trends. Sequential year-over-year trends improved for revenue, volume and revenue per acquisition.  As we said in January, we want to deliver guidance that is both realistic and achievable. While the slow start to this year clearly is a challenge. We are confident that progress we have made on growth initiatives, particularly as a result of acquisition activities will enable us to meet our commitments.  Given this environment and actions we are taking, we now expect to show revenue growth beginning in the second quarter. In a few minutes Mark will share color on our 2014 guidance. We have been dealing with dynamic market forces and we are in the process of updating our longer term view. We do expect to share this with you later in the year at our Investor Day Presentation. But in the meantime we continue to be bullish on the longer term growth drivers of this industry. First, the market will benefit from continued population growth and favourable demographics as baby boomers move into Medicare and live longer. Also advanced esoteric testing will grow as precision medicine drives demand for advanced diagnostic insights. And despite the slow uptake for the affordable care act, more ensured buyers will gradually begin to enter the market each year. And then finally, medical guideline changes do influence physician behaviour and we expect to see increases in some tests such as hepatitis C, non-invasive prenatal testing, lymph syndrome and lipid testing. Over the long term we see significant opportunity in being a high quality, low cost provider of diagnostic information services which are essential to healthcare delivery. We remain committed to executing our five-point strategy and what I'd like to do now is to give you an update on progress. Our top priority for 2014 is to restore growth. We are making solid progress on our growth priorities. On the business development front, we've completed seven acquisitions at the beginning of 2013, including three this year. Prior to our January call we announced the agreement to acquire Solstas. I'm happy to say the integration is now well under way. I've been impressed with the professionalism in the quality of the Solstas team that I had met. Solstas will help us improve top-line performance and strengthen our presence in important region of the country. We also recently completed the acquisition of Summit Health a few days ago. Summit solidifies our leadership decision in the fast growing wellness business. In this business we partner with employers in health plans to provide an overall health assessment, including biometric screening as well as a comprehensive laboratory analysis. Summit is complimentary to Quest owned wellness offering whose customers tend to be large employers. Both businesses have been growing organically in the double digits. Summit offers wellness services largely through third parties, including through large health plans and employers. And both Summit and our wellness business also works closely to help retailers and urgent care centres meet their necessity explored new business models. Our specimen collection is largely based on vein puncture and Summit relies largely on fair sticks. This positions us well in the major Wellness segments including screening, immunization, coaching and disease management.  At Investor Day on 11/20/12, we indicated that we are targeting 1% to 2% of revenue growth through strategically aligned acquisitions. As we have shared Solstas Lab about 5% to revenues on a annualized basis. In addition other acquisitions including Summit and Stewart, we add an additional 1% to 2% to revenues growth in 2014. Beyond the quarter growth we have been highlighting the opportunity to target with hospital systems in integrated delivery networks. Our investor day on 11/20/12 we spoke about the challenges that integrated delivery networks would begin to have as a result of intensified reimbursement pressure and following utilization.  There are many ways that Quest Diagnostics can help from performing reference testing to various forms of laboratory management partnerships, all the way to including purchasing of hospitals outreach business, such as our recent agreement with Stewart Health System.  What we're seeing over the past year is increased interest from the C-suite of integrated delivery networks, interested in learning more about our broad experience across the spectrum of service offerings. During our last call we announced that we have reached agreement with three humidity based hospitals, and we indicated that we would have more to share. I am pleased that during the quarter a lab professional services team reached agreement with a significant regional integrated delivery network. This is a multi-million dollar opportunity evolving several sights. We have taken out hundreds of this client's former employees to operate this lab network and we begin to generate revenues earlier this month.  These are all exciting opportunities for us. This last win is further evidence that hospital leaders are open to new ideas to help them manage the emerging challenges of reimbursement pressure and lower utilization. We have the experience and expertise to help tailor solutions for the needs to hospitals of all shapes and sizes. Finally, we are seeing results from our focus on specific disease stay-in conditions. We talked about the strong growth in our Wellness business, combining with Summit Health, will strengthen this business. We have also seen solid growth in our toxicology and prescription drug monitoring offerings, as well as improvements in Hepatitis C, BRC Advantage, and non-invasive prenatal testing. In Oncology, women's health, we have launched a test to assess the risk of lymph syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the higher incidence of colon, rectal, and other cancers. While we are making progress, we need to keep our focus on this top priority of restoring growth. We also continue to make progress driving operational excellence.  Our Invigorate cost reduction in this is expected to approach $700 million in run-rate savings by the end of this year compared to 2011. And we also are committed to our longer term goal of $1 billion in savings beyond 2014.  As we have said the operational excellence program which we call Drive, is improving our quality and efficiency, it will enable us to improve our overall customer experience. You know driving operational excellence is really all about creating a superior customer experience in towards that end we recently launched what we call Our My Quest, which is by Care360 patient portal that allow patients to take ownership of their own results and manage their conditions more effectively. A new federal rule that took effect earlier this month, gives patients in all 50 States the right to view their tests directly without first being authorized by a physician. We also made great progress on our simplifying the organizations strategy last year. So in 2014, our intention has been shifted towards building a high performance culture, focusing on our behaviours and delivering results.  We also made some important organizational changes. First, I'm pleased that Lidia Fonseca, an industry veteran has joined Quest as our new Chief Information Officer. I worked with Lidia years ago at Philips in Marlborough. Lidia is now fully engaged in this part of our plant to strengthen our IT capabilities, which includes improving the customer experience and driving efficiencies that will help us reach our $1 billion goal. Also as previously announced John Hayden, formally our Senior Vice President of Operations has moved into a key role to oversee our equity joint ventures. He has succeeded in the operation role by Jim Davis, who has deep operational experience and had led our Employer Insurance and Products businesses. Finally we continue to review our portfolio for opportunities to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services and enable us to continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We remain committed to our plan to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  The harsh winter made a particularly tough quarter. But we are seeing signs of continued stabilization in the business and closed this quarter strong in March. We are making progress and recognize that there is much more to be done.  Now I would like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of numbers, Mark.
Mark Guinan:  Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.75 billion were 2.3% below the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues were 2.1% below the prior year. Volume was 0.07% favourable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 3.5% to volumes. The seasonably harsh winter depressed volumes by approximately 2% compared to the prior year.  You've heard us talk about the impact of weather on our business in the past. Given the severity of this past winter let me take a minute to give you some color on how we calculate the impact of weather on our business. Our analysis is based on specific declines in volume versus trend for a specific geographies related to various specific weather events. Adjusting for acquisitions in weather, we are estimating our organic volumes decline less than 1% compared to Q1, 2013. This year-over-year comparison is essentially in line with our exit run rate from Q4, 2013, and is an improvement in the comparison from the earlier periods of 2013. Revenue per acquisition in Q1 was down 2.8% compared to the prior year. The recent acquisitions and price erosion each accounted for about 100 basis points of the change. While changes in business mix accounted for the remainder. However we except this metric to improve as we move through the year, as certain items will anniversary, including sequestration and certain commercial rates that were renegotiated during 2013, consistent with what we shared with you in the fall of 2012. We continue to plan our average reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015. Q1 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical cross testing, healthcare IT, and our remaining products businesses were down 4.3% compared to the prior year, with approximately half of that impact related to the devastator of Inter X last year.  Adjusted operating income at 13.5% of revenues was about 1.7% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to lower margins associated with reimbursement pressure and limited flexibility in our ability to remove costs in response to short term weather events. Despite these challenges we continued to make progress on our Invigorate Program, which helped offset wage bill inflation and lower margins on our more recent acquisitions.  As we indicated on our last call, we expect to achieve approximately $200 million in real life savings during 2014, and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term gaol of $1 billion over time.  Adjusted EPS of $0.84 was $0.05 below the prior year, with an $0.11 headwind resulting from the impact of the unfavourable weather in the quarter. Special items totalling $28 million principally restructuring in integration costs, reduced reported operating income as the percentage of revenues by 1.6%, and reported EPS by $0.13. Last year's first quarter included $45 million of costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.5%, and reported EPS by $0.17. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 4.3%. Two issues to keep in mind on our bad debt, first as you think about the year, our bad debt expense is typically the highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with the un-met deductible amounts. Second, from a benefit design perspective, as we shared in our last call, we expected that employers would shift more costs to individuals and we see a continued increase in the prevalence of high deductible plans. Despite this trend we believe we are managing the change in operating environment and continue to see improvement in our collection rates across our various pair categories, as a result of our efforts to drive operational excellence. DSOs were 49 days, a two day increase from last quarter, principally as a result of the Solstas transaction. That is our results include all of the Solstas accounts receivable balance, but only revenues since the early March close date.  Cash from operations was $84 million in the quarter, compared to $47 million in the prior year. Cash flow for Q1 is seasonally the weakest of the year and as we explained last year our Q1, 2013, cash flow was reduced to a tax payment that has previously been deferred. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $32 million of our common shares at an average price of $52.80. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also acquired Solstas and recently went to the Capital markets and ran a very successful $600 million bond offering last month at attractive rates, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and also remain committed to paying down the majority of the debt associated with the Solstas transaction over the next 18 months. Turning to guidance, our guidance remains unchanged to what we shared last month. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2% to 4% compared to a year ago. Earnings per diluted share to be approximately between $3.95 and $4.15. Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million. While the first quarter was negatively impacted by the weather, we continue to believe that guidance is realistic and achievable, and will benefit from our recently completed acquisitions and our efforts to restore growth. Finally I'd like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement keep in mind some items were anniversary this year, including sequestration and certain commercial contracts. On acquisitions, you should dial 6% to 7% revenue growth into your models for the remainder of the year, 5% from Solstas and an additional 1% to 2% from other acquisitions in the year. And we expect acquisitions to benefit EPS gradually through the year as integration plans unfold, both Solstas and Summit will be dilutive to second quarter earnings but accretive for the full year. As a result of these items, we now expect second quarter EPS to approximate the prior year level and to show growth in adjusted EPS in the back half of the year.  Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen Rusckowski:   Thanks Mark, and to summarize the harsh winter hurt us in the quarter, but we are seeing positive signs in underlying trends. Fortunately Congress lifted a cloud from our industry with a recent legislation that effects the clinical out fee schedule, and our top priority for 2014 is restoring growth.  We are pleased with progress we are making on our growth priorities and particularly the recent acquisitions. As we said in January, we believe our 2014 guidance is both realistic and achievable. Now we would be happy to take your questions, operator.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse:  Thanks and good morning. I just want to follow-up on the pricing question. Mark, if I heard you correctly, I think you sort of talked about the revenue pre-requisition being down 2.8%. You kind of laid out the different components being acquisition, price erosion, and business mix. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the price erosion and business mix, you know components of that erosion because I think if I heard you correctly your assuming that pricing will be down 1% to 2% this year and next year. So given that you’re down almost 3% in 1Q, should we assume that you’re going to start an anniversary in some of these acquisitions and ultimately in some of these contract renewals and so we should see pricing start to improve sequentially throughout the year. Is that the right way to think about it?
Mark Guinan: Yeah I appreciate the question Glen. So first off the 1% to 2% guidance is really a three year from 2013 to 2015. So what we're, what I was trying to emphasise is that we're not deviating from what we had communicated. You know starting with our investor day in 2012 and I think pretty consistently, each time we have a chance to address it. So the, when you look at the 2.8% that I referenced, the revenue per rack, this quarter about 100 basis points was true price, and that's what we are referring to when we talk about the 1% to 2 percentage. True price independent from business mix and business mix obviously comes in two forms. One is, should we do acquisitions, for instance we've talked about the toxicology acquisition, we did mid last year. That can have a different structure and had lower revenue per rack, obviously also lower cost per rack as well, and therefore it has a negative mix impact on us.  The other one is the mix within our core organic business as we go forward and things can shift you know quarter-to-quarter depending on tax mix and so on and so forth. So the trend throughout the year, what I'm really talking about is the comparisons year-over-year will improve. Not necessarily you know forecasting and improvement in overall rent per rack, although we have talked about the fact that we have seen a positive trend in a number of tests per acquisition and that's certainly something that we would expect to continue.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Okay, I appreciate that. Steve maybe if you can just follow-up on the molecular diagnostics piece of the business. You know your primary competitor obviously has called out you know some big challenges getting paid in that area in 2013. Maybe we start and see a little bit of reprieve on that in 2014. Could you maybe comment in terms of what your collection experiences have been related to the molecular diagnostics and ultimately do you think this could be an opportunity as some of the payers start to maybe ease up a little bit on some of the restrictions here and can just be a tailwinds. For U.S. we think about the balance in 2014 relative to 2013.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah. Thanks. Glad it. Let me just underscore something that Mark just went through. We feel that we have good visibility on pricing and there has been a lot of interest at pricing in the past and as we said our guidance for the next three years is 1% to 2%. We shared at 2013 it was going be about 3%, we ended at about 3% and we actually showed in the first quarter that were making movement down. We actually believe that we’re executing well against our pricing discipline approach in the market place and the 1% real price effect in the first quarter, I think, underscores that strategy. So, Dan answered your on molecular diagnostics. Actually, we continue to work with payers and what I’d share is even though we had been in constructive dialogue, I would not say that it’s material change than what we’re getting paid for by payers. So, this is a continued process we continue to work at. We’re hopeful we’re having a good dialogue and good discussion, but I can’t say in the first quarter there was material change of what we were paid for versus prior quarters.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse:  Okay, thanks for the comments.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Thanks brother.
Operator: Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley:  Ah yeah, good morning.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Just a couple of questions here. Obviously, we’re hearing a lot of commentary around hep C. I just want to get your perspective. Are you seeing any upside to your hep c testing business as a result of sociability [ph] you expected to be a meaningful contributor for the remainder of the year?
Mark Guinan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. We did actually mention in Steve’s prepared remarks at just one of the areas that we had seen growth in. So, yes absolutely we’d seen growth and we expected to contribute to our overall business success for after remainder of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. And can you quantify for us?
Mark Guinan:  Yes.
Stephen Rusckowski: Now I’ll take that. It’s tough to quantify. I think as you’re commenting has a lot of visibility right now with the new drug therapies in the market place and now there is effective treatment for hepatitis C. There is lot more visibility to it and so therefore we should see some tailwinds in the testing we performed, but we can’t quantify for you at this time.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then on your ACA comments, obviously, it’s early on and we get most of the uptick in lives towards the - actually we’re getting in first quarter. But any early insights on ACA-related volumes? How are patients on exchanges utilizing that services versus kind of like your non-NCA population?
Stephen Rusckowski: Well. The best way that will I answer at this point were so digestive what we’ll see. We are at commences that for this year on the neutral-to-slightly positive for us in our numbers. We [indiscernible] of this industry or trying to understand the true impact of the exchange. We still believe there was increase at Medicaid volumes and we’re also trying to digest it and have it on the employer’s side. The [indiscernible] breaking is as you know we do have a larger percentage of our business with highly top [ph] peoples. We are relieving a fair percentage of the new lives. We will have higher deductibles and as interest they are aiming for our business both in [indiscernible] but actually these people will have to pay our pocket. It’s exactly [ph] what it does to pressure our bad debts. So, we’re digesting it all. We don’t have better fill for it yet, but again we believe it will be neutral to slightly positive in 2014. Mark, will you care to join? 
Mark Guinan:  Yeah. There is someone come out at us. One of the very positive aspects amongst many of the Affordable Care Act is that there is a number of diagnostic and preventative treatments that are not actually subject to many patients responsibility. It’s not clear that that’s broadly understood. So, until that’s broadly understood certainly the passion would be so much needed to taking advantage of past not having to work after deductible and these higher deductible plans. So, I think it’s very early. I think it’s the answer. And we’ll be interested, we’ll be monitoring it. I’m sure you’ll be asking us about regularly but it’s just too early to make a call at this point.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Let me just assemble [ph] on last comment on you for Affordable Care Act again. We believe Affordable Care Act continues to be net positive. This is free and net positive for us. We have said in the past, we’ll continue to say that more people are determined to continue with what we do and that’s the trust.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley:  And that’s – those are included in your 1% to 2% assumptions for pricing trends going forward? Yeah.
Stephen Rusckowski:  We have to do this.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Cherny with ISI Group.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning.
Stephen Rusckowski: Good morning.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc: So obviously, a few weeks ago everyone knows the push-outs you mentioned of the clinical lab fee schedule reimbursement changes. In terms of your negotiations there I guess you obviously think that the clinical lab has been a bit of the crosshair as seen with us for a while now. This is clearly a sign of positive for you guys. What you think was a key tipping point in convincing CMS to delay some of these costs particularly? And also what you did mention much also was the downside limits on those cuts of 15% released [rail guards] up to 17%.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah, Michael. I have described it this way is if we did a good job actually as an industry as you know active with the Miracle Clinical Episode Association so are number of people in this industry. We expect a fair amount of time walking the halls of Congress getting Congress involved and what this industry has paid in the past and what is at risk if it in fact we didn’t have any what we’ll describe as guard rails on the process going forward. Fortunately, we got them to listen. We were fortunately there also thinking about how they would do this year’s doc fix. We took advantage of that opportunity, and fortunately with the build-up was passed it allowed us some time now to get it to a good dialogue about the rule-making process and also that will allow us to have a comprehensive market view by code that will eventually set the prices that will take effect in 2017. So, we’re encouraged by that. We have worked on furloughs [ph] to make sure the rules are done correctly and eventually when we do the market analysis and again when I set up my remarks it’s a full market view including all segments of the market place and we feel good about that. We think it serves all segments well to be participants in that survey, and when we go through the data in 2015 and 2016 we’ll eventually have new prices in 2017. We did have caps at the per code level. You know they are at 10%, but until you get the market data you’re not sure really what the effect would be per code, but that’s 2017. So, we feel good about the process, we feel good that we’ve some time to digest it and create some stability with us but this is unknown in the market price and as I said from my earlier remarks it actually lifts the cloud that was over this industry that worked in the past. So, we feel good about what’s happened.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc:  Great. Thanks. And just quickly relative to maintaining the 1% to 2% compounded reimbursement cuts to 2015. Are there any other really unknown there are swing factors one way or the other that could impact on ’15 and the year currently debating to you positive or negative?
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah. Mark would you like to add that one?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. I think the add to that is no. I don’t think there is any other wildcards, at this point certainly not in the radar. So, I think as you mentioned in the past we’ve got a good handle on the cycle of commercial renegotiations. I think we got a pretty track good of be able to kind of guard rail those as Steve mentioned and we called the 3% going into 2013 that includes negotiation but had yet to be completed. At that point, we at that pretty much nail right on the head and we talked about obviously our setting those lower rates in 2014 and 2015 and certainly as we shared this quarter it seems like we’re delivering on that. So, at this point, we feel very confident in those guard rails of 1% to 2% that we mentioned over that period of time.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hey good morning, Darren.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I just keen to one of your comments, Steve, just around what you said you’re in the process of updating your longer term view. Can you just remind us what is your current long-term view of the market? I recalled at the initial Investor Day that you had hosted you thought it was around 4% market growth and maybe just give us a sense for how you’re thinking any differently about the longer term view.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Sure, well enough you to reiterate what we said in 2012 and I guess we have to update it. So, it’s all decimals, but we’ll tell you what we said. We said that we believe that market place was a good market and that’s this market will be growing at about 4%. Now in that market assumption, we assumed the Affordable Care Act would be taking full force in 2014 and as you know that hasn’t happened, so that was a big assumption in that. Clearly, this has been pushed out. It could be more of a gradual build and we’ll eventually come back to you with our current assessment of the market. This fall we’ll evaluate what our current forecast is as far as the Affordable Care Act. On the Investor Day I said my comments were really arranged [ph]. The population is growing, we’re all living longer and we [indiscernible] will be into the med care system. Also, advanced diagnostics are critical to persist with medicine. These all have very positive effects on other Diagnostic Information Services that are needed in the market place. So, we’ll update this when we have our Investor Day in the fall. Some of the assumptions that we had at 2012 really have changed, but we still are optimistic and bullish of the process with this industry.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s all for DGX [ph]. It’s clear that you’re suggesting here that the ACA benefits may just come in more gradually and that seems like a key assumption that’s changed and this would be cherished. Are there any other things that maybe changing for the better in your view because we’ve heard a lot from you just about the activity in the hospital domain? And I’m just wondering if you think you gain more traction there such that you have a different view the other way in that part of the market?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. We’ll see as it’s in our comments. We’re encouraged by the traction we are getting with our dialogues in hospitals. We’ve announced the relationships over the first quarter too a bit about those, and in their [indiscernible] range of difficult relationships that we formed but still got the boasted integrated delivery system. We feel good that they have decided to continue to work with us and for other in our relationship. We also announced the small hospital punitive [ph] hospital in North-western Connecticut this week in [indiscernible] again is a community in North-western Connecticut, but [indiscernible] hospital all these happened [indiscernible] the same thing and their cost structure there is [indiscernible] about that. We also announced with [indiscernible] is that there is [indiscernible] integrated delivery system that has multiple [indiscernible] and all the multimillion dollars as the volume for us and we’re encouraged about that. We started to see some of this. Then we shared this with you because the [indiscernible] is to build our discussion continued to build around and we think about that, but we’re not so optimistic that at this point we’re going to change our guidance because there are so building and you need to bring [indiscernible] will progress. We feel bit of our guidance for this year.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. That helps for me. Just one follow-up really with regard to your Q2 commentary, I guess be implied on flat year-over-year guidance for Q2 is roughly 6% to 7% below consensus on ETS line. Are you saying that most of that is the diluted nature from the DOs? Can you just suppose think about prior year you’re giving us this Q2 flavor at this point?
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah, I do appreciate the question. First up, generally, we don’t really address consensus but what I can tell us you is that if we look at the year obviously we’re guiding to something that’s just little bit better than flat year-over-year. So, really the question is how the cord is to get lay down. In the first quarter your nickel [ph] behind and you mentioned that you do have a little bit of delusion in the second quarter from soft business of it, which really implies that we’re going to pay cut nickel or so in order to grow [indiscernible] in the back half of the year as these acquisitions really become creative through the integration synergies that were driving and take a little time to accomplish. So, yeah I’m not quite timed to your 6% to 7% below consensus, some of the priority was about 6% and while we’re not speaking precisely, giving you precise number in Q2 which does try to simulate generally flat, a little bit of growth on the underlying business offset with a bit of delusion on the two recent acquisitions. 
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. That’s all folks. Thanks very much.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Um hmm.
Operator: Next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum.
Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum: Hi guys. I also just wanted to say hi to Lydia. I worked with Lydia too and I think that’s a great hire.
Stephen Rusckowski: Great.
Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum:  I wanted to ask a couple of questions too about the hospital deals because it seems to me like those are really starting to take off. That’s the first thing and you probably talked about this before. But can you just remind us sort of what your targeting in terms of return on capital with these deals? How we should think about what the metrics that they really need to achieve for you to want to get involved with – I assumed margin is probably less of a concern than return but maybe just elaborate and then we’ll have a follow-up.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah. I’m characterizing that every hospital has its own lab strategy. They were approaching peacefully just working in and were having a discussion about the lab strategy and just like so much it helped to see one strategy seem one strategy same for the lab. And what we try to give you is portfolio of all the different opportunities, which we find exciting. People are engaged dialogue with us. It all starts. We have a strong hospital business as you know. We do reference testing for hospitals and people don’t really like relationship and some of these deals will take the form of laboratory management and the deal we talked about that’s a multi-side deal has a portion of that laboratory management. We also have forms of joint ventures in the past. We have a number of successful joint ventures with integrated delivery systems. And finally, in some cases hospitals want to get out of the outreach business and already between [indiscernible] and the [indiscernible] stores selling the remainder of the household outreach that today of course some hospitals coming their way. It is an encouraging time that many systems are now thinking or rethinking what they should do in the labs base in the setting that’s best for them to focus on what they do well and rely on earlier [indiscernible] we do well for them. So, we think that’s encouraging. This supports what [indiscernible] We believe those two large role drivers of value are growth and return on invested capital, and we think that this business or lab professional services business will allow us to restore growth and at the same time be accredited to our return on invested capital targets as before. And I will turn to Mark to add some color to that as well.
Mark Guinan: Yes, Steve mentioned. Bill, I’m sure you’re smart, at least deals come in different shapes and forms. So, we buy a business from average business like they were still like [indiscernible] there’s some of the greater invested capital but you also will get higher margins because you owned the business. Whereas in some of the other deals we’re really just partnering. Obviously, we don’t have as much investments and the margins, therefore, are acceptably lower to still get an attractive return on invested capital. So, we’re really focused on growing our return on invested capital. Certainly, we try to do as well as we can in the margin in every given deal, which suggests that the structure of the partnership deals are going to be lower margin with lower invested capital than the acquisitions. I also want to make sure we’re clear because you mentioned that some of the acquisitions are lower margin that’s really the initial margin, so until we drive those synergies. But as we mentioned and I think I specifically addressed on the January call once we get Solstas, for instance, up and running we expect those margins be comparable to our base overall business.
Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum: That’s helpful. And do you have an actual return hurdle than an acquisition have to gather a deal have they hit that you can share?
Mark Guinan:  Yeah. No that we can share. Well, we have, as I said, we’re really targeting to grow our return on invested capital. So on the acquisitions we do mention that we wanted to be a creative on our RIC basis by the third year but have not shared specific overall RIC targets or hurdle rates. I mean as you know, Bill, there is some subjectivity on this because everything has different levels of risk. So, we certainly would not accept anything below or cost of capital and we turn on getting to grow our RIC, which suggests they all have to be above our current level of our RIC but we haven’t shared special hurdle rates.
Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum: Okay. Great. And then just one final question, I guess, for both of you. There seems to be an ever-growing mass of clear wave especially labs and for the most part you haven’t done a lot in that area, you’ve done a couple, I guess, in the past. But can you just kind of tell us your view on that? Can those be attractive opportunities? Those seem to be growing really fast, but I know that there can be other concerns maybe about integrating them with the business like yours, but I just be curious if you think that’s an opportunity for growth or not.
Stephen Rusckowski: That’s so. First of all, one of our points of our five-point strategy is to build or deliver disciplined capital deployment and as part of that we have a goal to go over 1% to 2% through acquisition. And what we said is we want to use our money wisely. We’re going to look for strategically aligned accredited acquisitions, and as you get from our comments this morning we feel good about the progress we’re making, we are on the high end of that range. We provided it in our five-point strategy. We’re tracking well against it. So, Bill in terms of speciality labs we will consider speciality labs that are strategically aligned and they need to be creative. Every deal is a deal by itself and we need to look at it based upon how we can make money for our shareholders, but we’ll consider it but in the end that’s be aligned. We also would consider make [indiscernible] considerations whether we could do it ourselves and whether it’s wise for us to invest on buyings so that we can do it ourselves, but at the end we need to deliver on our goals of making money for our shareholders and we’ll continue to put up through that filter.
Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum: Okay. Thanks.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Thanks Bill.
Operator:  Next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Good morning, Amanda
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company:  Hi guys. So, I just had a follow-up on some of the questions around volumes. I know there is a lot going on in the numbers that I’m curious. What you guys are seeing in terms of underlying dynamics relative to HAS [ph] plans just in excluding reforming [indiscernible] not. Are you seeing that impact Q1 volumes or benefit Q4 volumes at this point? 
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah, I think looking at that level of granularity it’s a little bit tough and especially looking at the first quarter, Amanda, with the amount of weather we saw it’s tough to read too much in some of these trends at the moment. 
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. And I’m just curious about the pathology side of the business. Are you seeing, I guess two questions there, one, any attempt to sort of insourcing dynamics that’s given all the reimbursement issues in this phase? And then secondly is that an area that you think maybe - or I guess are you seeing more assets in that area, come to market, is that something that you would consider being more active in terms of M&A?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. Let me give you some color on pathology. Clearly with the ADA [ph] three or five cuts last year, there’s more pressure on everyone to make money in pathology services and also on the tech side. You would have expected given the pressure that there will be increased interest in outsourcing if you will. What we shared before then really haven’t changed. We haven’t seen enough material change on people’s perspective on this, but we do have discussions with hospital systems, we go department if you will by department talking about what their strategy is in pathologies consideration, but no notable change at this point. 
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. Thank you very much.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Thank you.
Operator:  Next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffary.
David Clair - Piper Jaffary: Hi good morning, everybody.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Good morning.
David Clair - Piper Jaffary: First question from me. I was just hoping we could get an update on BRCAvantage and your NITT businesses. How are they performing compared to your original expectations and any color on reimbursement?
Stephen Rusckowski:  Yeah, sure. Let me take that. BRCAvantage as you know we entered the market place in the fall. We did this very, very quickly after the Supreme Court decision in June, we feel good about that. We’re gaining traction in the market place. As you introduced product you first have to introduce it to your customers. There is a variety of segments in this market place from the surgery to radiology to women’s health specialist, and we’re doing that as we speak. We’re actually tracking to our internal plan, which obviously would have a ramp build into it and we feel good that we’re making the progress we would expect. But also non-evasive prenatal testing is a growth market for us, we’re focused on that as well. We feel that with the progress we’re making there we think it’s a fast growth market place. It is a great example where medical guidelines are actually stimulating demand for us and we’re taking advantage of those new guidelines of the market place. So, in summary they’re both tracking, they’re both opportunities for growth for us and we’re looking about their prospects. And Dan, any colour you can give us on reimbursement for using one of those? Mark, would you want to add anything to that?
Mark Guinan: Yeah. We have successfully negotiated reimbursement rates with the typical health plans that we contract with. We feel good about the prices again similar to what Steve said on expectation as not just volume but the reimbursement rates that we thought we could achieve. We’re feeling good about those. So, the reimbursement environment is reasonable certainly like any other task that starts to get lot more attention - the payers start to put some things in place like pre-authorizations, etc. that can slow down the process, make things a little cumbersome and you’re going to work through some of those issues initially to smooth up the process but no major hurdles on reimbursement in those two categories right now.
David Clair - Piper Jaffary:  Okay. Thank you. And then as you look at the portfolio right now, are there any businesses that you’re kind of looking at potentially the best thing or what’s your thoughts there? I know you’ve pointed out in the past that the [indiscernible] products business is something that could potentially be divested.
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. So again go back to our five-point strategy what we have worked on in the course of 2013 as we’re focusing on Diagnostic Information Services. Back in 2014 we actually sold four assets too small too larger. We continue to evaluate some other portions of our portfolio. When we had our Investor Day on 2012 we did talk about looking at our strategic options for [indiscernible] products, we’re currently still evaluating that. And we’ve got a few others that will evaluate but we’ll keep you informed as necessary. We continue to stay focus on our core business, which is Diagnostic Information Services and there is a few things we might consider changing in our portfolio but we made excellent progress making sure that we’re focused on bringing more Diagnostic Information Services companies into our portfolio with our acquisitions.
David Clair - Piper Jaffary: Okay. And then just one quick one on guidance. I’m assuming the update that you gave at mid March did not include Stewart or the IDN that you’re talking about right now. So, should we assume that these deals just get you more comfortable with guidance or should we assume that there is potential upside here?
Stephen Rusckowski: Yeah. Within the guidance we earmarked with the 1% to 2% for strategically aligned acquisitions. So, while we may not know exactly which acquisitions there might be, we typically have a pipeline. So, the Solstas’ acquisition kind of stands outside that given its size, you should really look at some [indiscernible] and the other two as kind of being within the envelope of that 1% to 2%. So, they weren’t explicitly in the guidance. I think you should assume they were in place of [indiscernible] guidance.
David Clair - Piper Jaffary: Okay. Thank you.
Stephen Rusckowski: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group.
Stephen Rusckowski: Hi Brian.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Hi good morning.
Stephen Rusckowski:  Good morning.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: How large is your clinical trial business? And despite the recent slowdown are you seeing any impact to that business from the recently high level of biotech financings?
Stephen Rusckowski: Mark, go and check that.
Mark Guinan:  Yeah. We have not shared the specific size. It’s one of the smaller businesses within our Diagnostic Solutions. But certainly the slowdown in R&D span has had some impact on the overall market within the clinical trials laboratory area and has made growth a little more challenging. But we also feel good about our service offering and some of the relationships that we have, which really enable us to maintain work with some of our - as preferred provider for a couple of the drug development company. So, it’s been tough headwinds but not anything of major significance in terms of the slowdown and we feel good about that business both today and about its future prospects.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Alright. Thanks. And was the doc fix legislation a fact during your acquisition of the remainder of the Stewart Outreach business and more broadly how does it impact the M&A environment?
Stephen Rusckowski: We’ll say that the doc fix legislation had no bearing on your view on our acquisitions that we’ve done in the past and also this year. And as far as the environment going forward it provides the lift, if you will, the cloud that was over the industry where we’re happy about that and it provides us some time now to work on the rule making we feel good about that. So, what it did do the doc fix is it will at least provide us with more clarity around pricing and in 2015 and 2016 some reasonable confidence around the clinical lab fee schedule pricing that we should be considering while we’re looking at acquisitions. So, it’s a part of the conversation, but I can’t say it had an overwhelming consideration for what we do with Stewart.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Does the legislation also make scale much more important in the industry?
Stephen Rusckowski:  Well, I think there is a lot of dynamics in general around scale in this industry. It’s true for the broader health care industry. Frankly, what you see us driving is a continuation of what we believe is necessary health care and more and more consolidation. What we did with Solstas, what we did with the other acquisitions are consolidating this industry. We think that’s strategically helpful to us and also we can make money our shareholders and we’re going to get continue to track down that road because we believe it’s the right strategy for Quest Diagnostics and I think it’s consistent with what you see in other parts of health care overall.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stephen Rusckowski: Okay. Thanks.

Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, I'd like to take you through the top line performance, update you on utilization and reimbursement trends, review our progress against our five-point strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and walk you through the guidance. So we always have said that 2013 would be a building year, and it was. And we have made good progress. During the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 2% from 2012. Volume increased 2.3% and sequential year-over-year trends improved for revenue, volume and revenue per requisition. I'd like to start by discussing the evolving industry dynamics. As you know lately, there's been a lot of discussion about headwinds in this industry, specifically from utilization and reimbursement pressure. Now we identified and discussed this at our Investor Day more than a year ago, and we have provided periodic updates. So what I'd like to do is to remind you of what we said and share our perspective on the marketplace. First, it is clear to us that health care utilization declined broadly in 2013. And it is conceivable that this trend could continue through 2014 based on the acceleration of employer to employee cost shifting and benefit plan design. Second, in terms of the expected market growth from the Affordable Care Act, it is now clear that the benefits will take longer to realize based upon the slower rollout. And then third, as we said in 2012, we continue to expect reimbursement to decline 1% to 2% per year, on average, from 2013 and through 2015. Given this guidance, we now expect revenues to be flat to down 2% for 2014, excluding the impact of Solstas. In a few minutes, Mark will give you some color on our 2014 guidance we introduced this morning. Now we continue to be bullish on the long-term growth drivers of this industry. This market will benefit from continued population growth and favorable demographics, as baby boomers move into Medicare and live longer. Esoteric testing will grow as physician medicine drives demand for advanced esoteric tests. And despite the slow uptake for the Affordable Care Act, more insured lives will gradually begin to enter the market each year. And then finally, medical guidelines drive physician behavior and we expect to see increases in some tests, like hepatitis C. Over the long term, we see a significant opportunity being a high-quality, low-cost provider of Diagnostic Information Services, which are essential to health-care delivery. With this, we remain committed to executing our five-point strategy, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress. While our top priority for 2014 is to restore growth, and I'm very pleased that our planned acquisition of Solstas Lab Partners is expected to contribute approximately 5% of consolidated revenues on an annualized basis and strengthen our presence in an important region of the country. And we will provide Solstas customers with access to Quest's full menu of esoteric testing and also our industry-leading Care360 connectivity solutions. As you know, our planned acquisition of Solstas is dependent upon necessary regulatory review. Our five-point strategy committed us to refocusing on Diagnostic Information Services. Since our Investor Day, we divested 4 assets, yielding about $800 million in proceeds. And we acquired 4 organizations, which supported our goal to generate 1% to 2% revenue growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. The Solstas transaction beats our stated investment criteria. One way of looking at Solstas is as a multiple fold-in acquisitions spread across 9 states. Also this combination strengthens our laboratory professional services organization. We see laboratory professional services as an important part of our growth strategy. After building our capabilities and pipeline for over a year, we are now pleased to announce that we've reached agreement with 3 hospital systems on lab professional services arrangements. We're excited about these opportunities. They do take time to implement and, therefore, we do not expect to see top line benefits before late in the second quarter, and this is built into our guidance. Innovation is another key element of our strategy to restore growth. Our new clinical franchise organization is helping us focus on servicing market needs and filling gaps in care. I would like to share just 2 examples of the progress we've made during the quarter. First, our introduction of BRCAvantage test. That happened in the fourth quarter. And second, we created a partnership with UCSF, as you know, one of the country's top academic medical centers. And organizations are now collaborating to turn UCSF's biomedical research into advanced diagnostics in autism, oncology, neurology and women's health. Our new franchise model is enabling us to act like a focused boutique laboratory, while maintaining the advantages of our scale. We also continue to make progress driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate cost-reduction initiatives ended the year ahead of expectations, with more than $250 million in realized savings in 2013. We also exited the year with run rate savings of more than $500 million, and this surpasses the original Invigorate goal that was established in 2011, a year earlier than planned. This positions us to exceed our $600 million goal in run rate savings by the end of 2014, and this, again, compares to the run rate of 2011. And we now anticipate run rate savings approaching $700 million, and we also continue to be committed to our longer-term goal of $1 billion of savings beyond 2014. Now as we have said, operational excellence is not just about cost. We call our program Drive. It's about improving our quality and efficiency and this will enable us to improve our overall customer experience. We additionally simplify the organization and we're building a new culture, so we can improve our operations and grow. As part of this, were deploying a new set of behaviors and are becoming more external and customer focused. And hopefully, you can see this by the growing number of partnerships that we're announcing, like what we've done with Hologic, University of Massachusetts and as I just said, UCSF. And then finally, we continue to deliver on disciplined capital deployment. We shared this last year, that our plan is to continue to return a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We met those commitments this year and announced earlier today that we've increased our dividend by 10%. This is the third increase since 2011. Well, while we are in a difficult operating environment, we are taking the right actions to make our company a stronger and more effective competitor. We are making progress but at the same time, we recognize there's much more to be done. Now I would like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Good morning. As I discussed in the third quarter call, I am focused on improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our five-point strategy. I am pleased with our performance and pleased that we exceeded top and bottom line expectations. Our commitment remains to provide you with guidance that we believe is realistic and achievable. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter performance. Beginning with revenues, fourth quarter consolidated revenues of $1.76 billion were 1% below the prior year. Diagnostic Information Services revenues were 0.7% below the prior year. Volume was better than the prior year by 2.3%, including a benefit of acquisitions and our underlying volumes were lower by approximately 0.5%. Revenue per requisition in Q4 was down 3% compared to the prior year. Our second quarter acquisitions, principally Concentra's toxicology business, reduced revenue per requisition by approximately 1% in the quarter. As we expected, underlying revenue per requisition year-over-year comparisons improved as certain commercial contract changes anniversaried. Our underlying revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, underlying revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by approximately 3%, as we guided at the start of the year. I also want to address some specific business mix issues in the Diagnostic Information Services business. During the quarter, we did not see a material change in reimbursement or denial rates on molecular diagnostic codes from what we had been seeing earlier in the year. We saw strong improvements throughout the year in our toxicology and wellness businesses. In 2013, our anatomic pathology revenues were lower, principally due to softer volumes, including the impact of guideline changes on our Pap [ph] business and reduced reimbursement, principally from CMS. Turning to our Diagnostic Solutions business, Q4 revenues were unfavorable to the prior year by 4.2%, largely due to softness in our Clinical Trials business. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was 16.1% of revenues, about 90 basis points below the prior year. With the decrease principally due to lower revenue per requisition, a significant portion of the lower revenue is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiative, as Steve mentioned earlier. Adjusted EPS of $1.03, was $0.02 better than the prior year and better than our guidance of $0.93 to $0.98. As a result of the company's ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, restructuring and integration cost of $12 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 0.8% and reported EPS by $0.06. Last year's fourth quarter included $36 million of costs associated with the restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.1% and reported EPS by $0.14. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.7% or 30 basis points higher than the prior year. The higher bad debt was driven by payer mix, as changes in employee benefit plan design continue to shift costs to patients through coinsurance and higher deductibles. We expect that trend to continue. Despite that trend, bad debt was stable to improve for every payer type, and the biggest improvement was related to cash collections from patients. This achievement is the result of dedicated effort in our Drive Operational Excellence program. DSOs were approximately 47 days, an improvement of 1 day from the third quarter. Adjusting for the ibrutinib tax payment in the quarter of $175 million, our adjusted cash from operations was $385 million in the quarter compared to $380 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $76 million in the quarter compared to $60 million a year ago. With the increase related to additional spending to support our Invigorate initiatives and the investment in our new Lab of the Future in Marlborough, Massachusetts. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million common shares for approximately $113 million. For the full year, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of our stock and we have approximately $828 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Turning to guidance for 2014. We are expecting results from continuing operations before special items and the benefit of the planned acquisition of Solstas as follows: Revenues to be flat to down 2% compared to 2013; earnings per diluted share to be between $3.90 and $4.10; cash provided by operations to approximate $900 million and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Let me share a few comments about our assumptions. On Solstas, we have not included a benefit in our forecast at this time. However, we expect that it could contribute approximately 3% to 4% to revenues this year and approximately $0.05 to $0.10 to adjusted earnings per diluted share, depending on the timing of the close, which, at this point, we anticipate in the second quarter. We expect to finance this deal with debt. We've targeted a long-term debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 and 2.25 and therefore, our intent is to pay down a majority of this debt over the next 18 months. Just to be clear, the guidance of flat to down 2% does not include Solstas. However, assuming we close Solstas in the second quarter, that would imply guidance of 2014 revenue growth of somewhere between 1% to 4%. Related to the Affordable Care Act, we have signaled for the past few quarters that we are expecting a muted impact from the Affordable Care Act in 2014 due to the delay of the employer mandate, a reduction in the number of states that have decided to expand their Medicaid programs and initial challenges related to the implementation of the insurance exchanges. Additionally, we continue to see an increase in the amount of cost sharing deployed through benefit design changes, which will put pressure on utilization and bad debt. As a result, we believe the Affordable Care Act will be neutral to slightly positive in 2014, but we still expect to see a bigger benefit over the long run, beyond 2014. On reimbursement. CMS reduced the clinical lab fee schedule by 0.75% in January. The physician fee schedule was also reduced in January by CMS. In addition, commercial reimbursement pressure continues, although we expect fewer negotiations in 2014 than in 2013. As we shared earlier, we reached agreement on 3 new lab professional services partnerships during the past few weeks. We expect them to be implemented later in the second quarter of this year and provide some volume lift as we head to the back half of the year. However, keep in mind they generally carry lower margin than our traditional business. On Invigorate, we're expecting approximately $200 million in realized savings this year. These savings will help offset price erosion, inflation in our wage bill and annual incentive compensation. And finally, as you build your models, I want to remind you that the sequestration reimbursement cut will not annualize until the end of the first quarter. I also want to note that the unusual cold and snow and ice storms this month have negatively impacted our business. This impact has been taken into account in the full year guidance and obviously, is fully contained in Q1. 2014 has been a challenging year to model, with more operational variables in play than the normal year. In the short term, there are pressures on our industry. However, based on our scale, new organizational structure and progress we are making on our five-point strategy, We believe we have a good plan that positions us well for the longer term, now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, again, 2013 was a building year for Quest. We saw sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and we continue to make good progress. Despite the current tough environment, Diagnostic Information Services remain critical to health-care delivery and we believe this industry is attractive. Finally, we have the right strategy to help us navigate the challenges and deliver superior shareholder returns. Now with that, we'd be happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cherny from ISI.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So I just want to dig in to Solstas a little. You guys have had a pretty targeted M&A approach over the course of the year in terms of buying hospital outreach labs. Solstas is obviously a little bit of a bigger bite in terms of capital outlayed contribution. Maybe could you talk a little bit about what initially attracted you to Solstas, specifically kind of how they came on your radar screen? And then from a growth perspective, once you on-board that into your organization, what do you think that can do to drive incremental growth as you look to that first point in the restore growth effort?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Thanks, Michael, for the question. Let me start and then I'll turn it to Mark. First of all, what I said in my comments earlier is that we have set our focuses on Diagnostic Information Services. Second, I would say that Solstas has always been on our radar screen. And what we said in our five-point strategy is we would look for strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. We said on an annualized basis it would be in the 1% to 2% range. And at the same time, what we have said, we would consider larger acquisitions than what we've seen with the acquisitions we've done to date, which are 4. But at the same time, those don't come around that often. So Solstas became available. As you know, it was owned by Welsh, Carson. We went through that process. We're happily saying at this point that we're engaged to acquire Solstas. It's all dependent upon regulatory approvals. It is strategically aligned with our business, and we believe it meets our accretive thresholds that we have shared, as far as what we expect to get out of the acquisitions. So Mark would you like to add to this as far as what we expect from growth.
Mark J. Guinan: Sure. And I'll just add 2 points, really, Michael. One is the same financial metrics that we have discussed in evaluating some of these small tuck-in deals have certainly been applied to this deal in terms of our focus on ROIC. We've got an NPV metric and then also we've talked about the fact that we're looking for things to be accretive in the second year. Obviously, this one looks like, based on the timing, we'll be able to achieve that in the first year. So the same kind of financial rigor that we put in the smaller deals that's been applied to this one. And in many ways you might look at this as a kind of a consolidation of multiple, small tuck-in deals all at once because it's very similar to the type of deals that we've been talking about in our 1% to 2% strategy. The other thing is we've talked about reshaping our portfolio. Obviously, you can't time these things perfectly, but as we monetized some assets last year, and now we've added the Solstas business, it's kind of swapping out some things that were not key in our focus areas and then adding, obviously, a large business that's very similar to our core.
Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then, Mark, one quick housekeeping question in terms of the guidance. Any expectations built into the guidance for buyback?
Mark J. Guinan: At this point, you should assume generally flat share count, that our buybacks would be enough to prevent dilution. And obviously, we'll evaluate things throughout the year in terms of the best use of cash. But no significant buybacks within our assumptions. But sticking to our strategy around returning a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders, so certainly not deviating from that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci from FBR.
Andrea Alfonso - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: It's actually Andrea Alfonso subbing in for Tom. I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question about Solstas, particularly if you could provide additional color on operating margin, payer and customer mix, and what type of visibility you might have on client retention following the close of the deal?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. Good questions. Obviously, we went through a lot of due diligence on this. We just gave you the comments about the financial thresholds. We feel very good about the opportunities we have to consolidate this in our existing operations. This is from a sales perspective as well as from an operational perspective. We've shared in the past we particularly like acquisitions that a large portion of the synergies are based upon cost. We see a good opportunity for this acquisition to do that. And as Mark just said, it allows us to meet our thresholds for our financial targets going forward, so we feel good about that. As far as retention, we actually, as part of the planning for the integration, feel good about how we can combine our organizations in each of the respective states. As I said, it crosses about 9 states. We've done a detailed look at those accounts. We also have taken a look at how we would integrate, again, dependent upon regulatory approval for this transaction, integrate our sales forces. We think that's a prudent plan. And we actually feel good about retaining the majority of the business that we would acquire. Obviously, when you make any change, there's always going to be some reasonable attrition. You can never retain it all. But we think our plans in place are solid plans. So -- Mark, would you like that of that?
Mark J. Guinan: It's just that, I think, as many people are aware, this business does contain -- a portion of its revenues are through laboratory professional services agreement, and that does tend to come with a lower margin. But once we get through the integration period, we would expect that the like and like elements, so kind of their core business margins should be comparable to Quest's organic margins. And then the laboratory professionals, for several services margins would be similar to what we expect to get in Quest as well. It's just that the mix is slightly different than Quest overall.
Andrea Alfonso - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And separately, I did have a question on the quarterly EPS progression. You touched on a couple of items such as sequestration in the cold, cough, flu. But I'd be curious to hear if there may be any other changes that you're seeing that would -- that typically impact the seasonality, the historical seasonality, given the changing benefit design landscape?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. I'm not going to get into more detail on the quarters as I thought it would be prudent just to mention that the weather has had impact. And I guess the good news is that we waited to give our guidance until we had a chance to see that play out. The other thing that is typical is, it depends and it really is material where the holidays fall. It depends, sometimes, quarters you have more or less billing days than last year. But there's really nothing beyond the typical things that we see year-over-year that drive a little bit of difference in quarter-to-quarter. I think the big change in which -- I'm sure everyone was familiar with, but I want to just to remind people, was the sequestration started in April 1 of last year, and then just to address the issue around the weather here in January across the country.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: First off, could we talk a little bit about capital allocation? Going -- looking at your guidance, capital expenditures looks like it's up a little bit higher than historically. Is there some onetime or new spending items that you guys are looking at this year?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. So this really is being driven by the next phase of Invigorate. As we have mentioned previously, the second phase of Invigorate is more about really redesigning our processes and our tools. And some of that requires greater investment. So I really attribute it entirely to the next phase of Invigorate. And it should not be seen as a long-term level. It really is to get to that savings level that Steve referenced, which is the $700 million exit rate in 2014 and then the $1 billion beyond that.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Would that include consolidating systems and improving those types of operations, Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Those are certainly things that you should expect to where we're working on. Those are critical to driving efficiency and effectiveness.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: It's -- what we actually spent was within our guidance for the year. So it's consistent with what we'd shared.
Mark J. Guinan: I think he was talking about the $300 million guidance I gave for 2014.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes. And then looking at your 2014 revenue guidance of flat to down 2%, just wondering, we know what you're thinking about for revenue per requisition over the next couple of years, but where do you think organic volume is going to shake out this year? I know it's hard to crystal ball that, but given the utilization trends we've seen, just wondering if you have any color or thoughts you can provide for us.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, let me start. First of all, consistent with what we've said in the past is that we are assuming in our guidance our strategic goal for acquisitions. So there's some portion of that in the guidance, number one. Number two is we assume some price erosion, which is consistent with our stated guidance that we provided back in 2012, which is 1% to 2%. And if you recall, we've been consistently saying that 2013 would be a stronger year, if you will, in terms of price erosion. We actually guided at 3% in 2013, and then after 2013 we'd see less. And so, therefore, we're still saying 1% to 2% for that period of time, 2013 to 2015. Second -- third is, we still are assuming some question marks around utilization. And so we put that altogether, Kevin, and that's how we came up with the 0 to down by 2%. And again this excludes Solstas.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Right. I guess, I was trying to see if you could help us out on organic growth, Steve? Organic volumes.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. So we're not going to give a specific number at this point, Kevin. But I think, directionally, if you think about Steve's comments that we do have some additional small tuck-in acquisitions assumed, because that is part of our strategy, and then a price decline that would be smaller than we experienced in 2013, obviously, to get to that guidance of 1% to 2% over the 3 years, you can probably land on what we're thinking in organic volume. And the drivers are, really, the things that Steve referenced, which is we don't expect, as I mentioned in my comments, that the benefit plan redesign is done and we continue that -- we expect that to continue to be a driver on utilization. So that's certainly one factor. Another one, certainly, there's some uncertainty around the SGR fix. We don't know how that's going to play out. So as I mentioned, there's a number of variables this year that made it difficult to model. And we think that the guidance range we've given, as I said, is realistic and achievable given all that uncertainty.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I have a few things, I guess. First of all, just, you made a comment that the uptick, albeit a modest 30 basis year-to-year in bad debt, was largely co-pays and coinsurance. I just wonder where you stand now if you have a sense of how much of that bad debt is coinsurance and co-pays, as opposed to truly uninsured.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Sure. A majority of it is really co-pays and coinsurance, and we expect that to continue. We actually do reasonably well on the uninsured and it is a very small portion of our total revenue. So most of that is coming from coinsurance and co-pays.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then my other follow-up question was just to take a quick broad question on the Washington landscape. You mentioned the doc fix. There's also out there for 2015, there's this proposal to go and review the lab fees schedule line by line based on technological changes. Have you had either directly or through the trade association any update on any of those developments and what we can expect?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Yes, we have, A.J. As a matter of fact, this week, we're actively working with ACLA, our trade association. A matter of fact, we had a call to talk about where we stand. We've engaged with members of Congress. There's 2 sides of this, as you mentioned. There's the SGR fix. As you know, Washington now, there's talk about a long-term fix, not just an annual correction, if you will, for the problem. So whether that's going to be successful or not is the question and how they fund it is the other question mark. So we're in the middle of that. We are hopeful that our discussion around the broader discussion around the clinical lab fee schedule will help us. We put a proposal on the table. The proposal will allow us to prudently work with CMS of going through the codes, do this in a reasonable -- with a reasonable approach, have some time to respond, have some reasonable caps per year and do this over a period of time with good data, with good process and good discipline. They're happy to see our proposal. I mean, we're working this as the Washington process works. So we're actively on this as a trade association.
Operator: Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the hospital deals you guys talked about on the call here, can you talk a little bit more about the terms there? How much do they vary deal to deal? And then just talk a little bit about the pipeline you have for future deals of that nature?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. It's a good question. First of all, we're very encouraged about our building funnel, the discussions were having. As you recall, as part of our growth strategy, we believe that many hospital systems and hospital CEOs that I engage with, many are asking a question about their lab strategy. And you've seen 1 lab strategy, you've seen 1 lab strategy, just like any strategy in health care. So what I'll share with you, eventually, when we disclose the specifics on some of these deals, you're going to see a wide range of arrangements that we have. You'll see community hospitals, where we're actually taking on all their lab activities, and it's actually a reasonable revenue number for us. You'll see chains of hospitals that have decided to partner with us. As you know, we already have joint ventures established with a number of organizations, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, something we already have. So we are actually encouraged by the level of interest and the discussions we are having. And we are looking forward to be able to share with you some of the specifics as it gets to the place where we can disclose it. But a wide range of possibilities, as you would expect you would see in health care.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And in the aggregate, fair to say that you think those would be ROIC accretive to the company over a 3- to 5-year kind of basis?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. We're not going to do anything that doesn't provide growth and is accretive to ROIC.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then lastly, just, Mark, maybe on cash use, can you sort of rank -- or you mentioned sort of the dividend, obviously, and the financing terms for Solstas. But just curious how you rank order priority uses of cash this year between the various options?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Sure. So as I gave in the guidance, we're estimating approximately $900 million of operating cash flow. Obviously, we also generate some cash non-operationally as well, so we have more cash than $900 million to work with. If you take $300 million out for capital, that leaves about $600 million of free cash flow. Our commitment is to return a majority of that to our shareholders. So you should expect more than half of that. You know what our dividend is going to be, which should be a little bit south of $200 million. So certainly at a minimum, the balance between delivering over half and the dividend payment will be through share repurchases. And as I mentioned, throughout the year, obviously, we're going to look at other cash generation and uses and then base that decision based on what we think is the best way to create value for our shareholders. So that's kind of the basic guidance at this point and we'll, obviously, give updates throughout the year.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. One last one, if I could sneak in, on utilization. I think some the managed-care companies has talked a little bit about a pull-forward effect in the fourth quarter, ahead of ACA implementation. So just wondering if you think it's possible we might see a greater-than-usual seasonal dip into 1Q? And any color there would be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: It's hard to predict this, as you know. There's a lot effects in the fourth quarter. Obviously, this past year, there were some questions about how the holidays fell. We had an easier compare because of Sandy. Yet at the same time, there were some difficult days in terms of our weather in the Northeast. So you put it all together and we're not sure it had a material effect in Q4 other than what I just described. So hard to predict.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So I just have a follow-up on the reimbursement side. In terms of the 1% to 2% that you gave for 2014. Is it fair to say that you probably have some pretty good visibility into that number excluding, of course, the SGR fix?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. Mark, why don't you take this.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. I think it's very fair. If you look at 2013, we -- because of the magnitude of the reimbursement reduction, we chose actually to explicitly share that with you. And as we've talked throughout the year, and as we mentioned in this call, we hit that pretty much square on. So we have pretty good visibility throughout 2014, and we've built that into our assumptions. And other than SGR, we wouldn't expect there'd be anything that would surprise us materially. And again, that 1% to 2%, just to be clear, is 2013 through 2015.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So, I guess that -- I was going to ask about 2015 just given that maybe has a bit more uncertainty, particularly with the clinical lab fee schedule review. So are you still comfortable with that 1% to 2% in 2015 as well?
Mark J. Guinan: We don't really have any new information on 2015. And as you've seen recently with the physician fee schedule, there can be numbers that are thrown initially before there's really a lot of substance in terms of the discussions. So as Steve mentioned, we are actively engaged with the trade association, with CMS, on discussions. So we really don't have any information on which to update that estimate at this point. But that estimate, when it was put out in the Investor Day in 2012, did not contemplate any significant repricing of that schedule in 2015.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then, obviously, you've talked about M&A being a driver for you guys. Are you seeing anything -- or just an increase in opportunities at this point, given the reimbursement environment maybe not so great for some particular labs?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: That was part of our five-point strategy. We said we're going to continue to build our funnel of prospective acquisitions. They have to be strategically aligned. They have to be accretive. We've said this many times. We were targeting -- trying to get to 1% to 2% growth per year. As we've said, we've actually been on the high side of that range in 2013. We feel good about that. You saw the Solstas acquisition. What I'll share with you is we have other prospects on our list. We'll continue to evaluate those. Whether there's more on the list because of the environment, I can't say that. But again, we continue to be proactive in looking for areas where it would make sense so we can fold into our business organizations that would be aligned with what we need geographically and be able to return good returns for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I just wanted to go back to the hospital deals you referenced, Steve. Can you just maybe help us think about the kind of partners you have and the ones that start in Q2? Can you just talk a little more specifically there?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Unfortunately, I'm not going to give you any more color than what we have done, Darren. But I'll share with you, you're going to see, eventually when we disclose some of the arrangements, they're wide ranged. And I think this is very positive. It's not one specific type of arrangement that we'll have. And I think that speaks volumes, volumes to what we're willing to engage with health-care systems in doing. We approach many of these systems with a good reputation. We already deliver reference services to about 50% of the hospitals here in the United States. We have existing relationships in place. And so many CEOs in this integrated delivery systems are asking us for their help -- for our help in thinking through their lab strategy. And these take the form of large academic medical centers, smaller community centers, hospital chains, and they all have different plans and different expectations and we'll work with them, provided that in the end, we can deliver what they're asking for and second is, we'll get growth and a good return on invested capital. So it's a broad range of possibilities. And as we start to disclose this, you'll get a better feel for the different types of arrangements we'll have. And I think it speaks volumes again to the flexibility we have and the capabilities we have to be able to deliver on that.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got it. And then just one thing as it relates to this topic in Solstas. What is the status of the minority partners that were previously involved in the Welsh, Carson deal? It looks like Ascension. How are you thinking about the opportunity to work with them and what is the status of their involvement?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. So obviously, it's a critical part of the Solstas acquisition. And while we won't comment specifically on some of the interactions, we wouldn't have moved forward with this deal without full visibility to how that relationship might continue. We're acquiring 100% of Solstas so, therefore, this comes with the acquisition. We think it's going to be a good relationship and obviously, we're counting on continuing that into the future.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And just one last guidance question, if I could. With regard to the molecular pathology nonpayment issue, how does that get factored into your outlook and have you been able to resolve, at this point, any of that issue with some of the key states?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Absolutely. So first off, how does it gets factored in? Obviously, we've learned a lot since some of these changes have taken place over the last year. We have had a number of successes in getting reimbursement where initially there was some confusion or some issues with getting that. Some of it was just the time it took to some of the states to figure out the process for gaining reimbursements. Some of it was just a new requirement for more supporting data. As we've partnered with the various payers, we've learned a lot, and I would say we're making progress. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, we actually had some success in one particular molecular reimbursement code with a state Medicaid program that we've been working on all year. So absolutely making progress.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So in the past, you guided to your cost structure -- structuring, slating it about 2% to 3% every year. So does this still hold true? And then keeping that in mind and thinking about kind of like the contribution from the acquisitions, how should we think about margin expansion for this year? Or basically, what type of top line growth do we need to see in order to start seeing kind of that margin expanding, taking into account the benefits from Invigorate kind of like all in?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So let me begin, and then I'll have Mark fill in some of the details. And it feels like you have 2 questions there. One is related to Invigorate and the impact to the bottom line. And what we said this year that we're targeting $200 million for delivered savings in 2014. However, this will be offset by our typical offsets. One is we've talked about price. We provided the guidance around that already on the call. Second is we've talked about wage inflation, which we have every year. And we had that last year and will continue to this year. And then they will also be some other offsets to it. So our guidance assumes the Invigorate savings we planned for in 2014 and also the offsets. So, Mark, would you like to add anything to that?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. I know there's a lot of interest in margins, typically, people are looking for margin accretion. We're not going to give specific margin guidance. We understand the value, all other things equal, of accreting margin. But the laboratory management deals, as we mentioned, do come with lower margin, but they're going to give us growth and they're going to give us improved ROIC. And we believe that those are the 2 things we really need to focus on more than anything, given their high correlation to shareholder value creation. In terms of Invigorate, as Steve mentioned, we do have some things to pay for, whether it's price erosion, whether it's the wage inflation and, as I mentioned, we also have some incentive comp to cover year-over-year in 2014. So not going to get specific on margin, but some of the Invigorate drops to the bottom line, but a lot of it is paying for some other things that -- some costs that we have to Offset.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And as far as the market is concerned, in our opening comments, we provided you the color. It is an uncertain market. First of all, we talked about utilization in general. We do see this a growing trend of employers passing more of the health care cost to their employees. That affected us, as you know, in terms of our bad debt. Mark commented about that. We believe that could have an effect of further reductions in utilization in 2014. We don't know, but we're cautious about that. Second is we did say that the Affordable Care Act, because of its slow rollout, have a neutral to positive, slightly positive effect on 2014. But it's hard to predict based upon the new lives entering the systems with the new insurance products. At the same time, the net number has not been clear, and we're still working our way through that. And then finally, the price structure that we've talked about upfront. We feel good about the guidance we provided back in 2012. We feel we can still fit into that envelope and that's assuming also or includes what we did in 2013. So you put that altogether, you see the uncertainty that we see. And then we've considered all that in our guidance for this year, in 2014. And again, the guidance for our top line does not include Solstas, and Mark made that clear. With the Solstas, it's a different number. So hopefully, that's clear.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Right. And then secondly, now we're hearing a lot of chatter from payers and providers around kind of like the evolution from fee-for-service to outcome-based reimbursement and risk sharing. Does that come up in the conversations that you have with your payers and providers?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I would say it's a growing trend, and we continue to see this as an evolution. Obviously, with many organizations engaged in ACOs, there's discussion about eventual change from fee-for-service to a bundled payment, capital-to-payment system. However, it's moving at a slow rate. So it's not materially going to affect us in 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum.
William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division: So I guess I'm trying to look at sort of your business route with a slightly longer-term perspective here and understand -- I get what you believe are the drive -- or the pressures that you're facing in 2014, you've been really clear about that. I guess what I don't understand, why you think that 2014 is different than sort of any normal operating year? In other words, why wouldn't we expect those same kinds of pressures in the future? And then sort of along with that, what do you think is sort of a normalized model for you in terms of kind of revenue and operating income growth?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. I appreciate the question, Bill. And I'm guessing that many of you see the same longer-term attractive features of the market. And Steve mentioned those. Certainly, the demographics, I think, would pick up from the Affordable Care Act that are a little bit muted but going into the future. So I guess your question is more targeted towards -- are some of the headwinds going to go away? Not at -- I don't think our expectation would be that they're going to go away, there's always going to be pricing pressure. But certainly, the utilization issue that we've talked about, at some point, benefit plan redesign kind of gets done and it gets to kind of its equilibrium and its impact on utilization. Obviously, if there's some aspect of deferral where people are consuming less health care because they're deferring it versus they're just avoiding it, then that deferral catches up. So we can't predict the future any more than you can. But the expectation is that some of things that we're pointing to most specifically are going to either be reduced somewhat or are going to go away, and we're still trying to figure this out. But ultimately, the biggest thing is that the tailwinds, and it's not just the Affordable Care Act, but our belief that it's in the best interest of health care and society to do more diagnostics. Because if you want early detection or prevention, the way you do that is through more diagnostics. And we really believe that we are going to have the innovation and we're going to have the technology to help drive better decisions and, ultimately, better outcomes and lower costs. So that's our reason for optimism, not that we think that pricing pressures and some of the typical challenges are going to go away. It's really more that the tailwinds and the attractiveness of this space is a reason to believe.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So let me just add to that, Mark. Thanks, Bill, for the question. As we continue to believe, the Affordable Care Act will be net positive for the industry and for us. However, the rollout is going more slowly than we ever imagined back in 2012. So you asked the question why isn't this going to be the continuation for the future, well, we continue to believe that the train has left the station, there will be more and more insured lives in the system. And when there's more and more insured lives in the system, they're going to need what we do. So that's point number one. We do not see that affecting 2014 yet. We hoped for that 2 years ago, but we're not seeing it. You know as much as I do around that topic. Second is around demand. We've had 3 or 4 years of muted health-care utilization slowdowns, very slow demand. You can look at most studies; they cite the weak economy, the Great Recession, coupled with employer-benefit redesign. And we're all hopeful, with some recovery in the marketplace, this will have the offset of what we've seen for the last 3 or 4 years, so utilization will return. And with that, you talk to people in the health-care system, there's a fair amount of pent-up demand that should show itself back into the system and that will, prospectively, show itself mid to long term. We're not expecting this in 2014. What we do expect, that should -- things should start to improve as what I just described changes over time.
William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. So that's helpful. Just to push back slightly on that answer and just kind of see what else you're thinking about. I mean, it feels a little bit, not just from Quest but from the industry as a whole, that I've been hearing that same discussion since 2008. And so I guess one of the things I'm curious about is, as you sit around at the board level and think strategically, do you sort of create contingencies for, gosh, maybe this recovering environment never comes and are there other ways that we can be a growth business if the underlying growth doesn't really recover? Are there things you can still do to grow yourself?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good question. We're doing that, Bill. First of all, we're not assuming that this is going to change quickly and we are going to get a sunny day quickly in the overall market. We believe our growth strategy is the right one. We focused on 3 areas this past year in 2013. We'll continue to do that in 2014. First of all, we are the market leader, but there's plenty of opportunities in our existing market. And our focus on our sales organization will allow us to do a better job of executing what we deliver in this market. So that's point number one. Point number two, as you know, there are areas of this market that are growing, and so we've invested a portion of our portfolio of spending into those areas that are growing. We were one of the early introductions this year with the Supreme Court decision in June of BRCA. That's a new market opportunity for us. We'll get growth. We continue to see nice growth in our prescription drug monitoring business. We continue to see nice growth in our wellness business. So with our clinical franchises, we are investing in those portions of this marketplace despite the overall market that is soft that are growing, and that will help us get growth back into our business. And then finally is the third area, which we talked about earlier, is we've invested in laboratory professional services. We think this is, again, a new opportunity for us. It's going to build this year. And we think the prospects are still bright around that. So those are the 3 priorities that we talked about last year. They will continue this year and it's an example of how we're taking control, if you will, of our own destiny despite the soft conditions that we see overall in the market.
Mark J. Guinan: And the last thing I will add, Bill, and we've talked about this in the past, we believe pricing transparency is a huge advantage for us, and we believe it's just at the beginning. But we're going to see more and more pricing transparency, which will absolutely be an advantage for us in terms of our share in the market.
William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Those are hugely helpful answers and encouraging. I appreciate that. And then just one final question. Just, can you talk a little bit what you're seeing out there in the environment from other labs? Are you seeing sort of a meaningful uptake in the number of labs that are starting to cry uncle and looking for ways to get out of the business? On the flip side, there had been some trend to hospitals sort of taking share with internalizing tests and molecular tests and buying physician practices and whatnot. So what has the environment sort of shaping up in terms of what the other participants seem to want to do?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Let me start. First of all, you know in the fourth quarter there's been some announcements with some of our competitors in this marketplace, so it is a tough environment. Those are some of the larger players, but also a number of the smaller players you would expect to see the same pressure. I know I don't need to remind you, but I'll say it anyhow, is our dependency on Medicare as much less than many of the players in this marketplace who are much more dependent on Medicare. So all the pressure that we're talking around Medicare will affect others more than us. And that's felt out there in the marketplace. Second, as far as hospitals, they continue to look at becoming really integrated delivery systems. And to my earlier point about our discussions around laboratory professional services, they are now asking the question, do we want to continue to stay in hospital outreach? Do we need to focus on what we do well and rely on leaders like Quest Diagnostics to do what they do well for us? And that's a growing trend that we're seeing. We're early in that. We're having an active number of discussions in that regard, and we're hopeful. So I would say, what you'll see happening is an evolution of integrated delivery networks and actually, some settling out of what they will focus on in their organizations, given their acquisitions of physicians in the past and what that means toward what we focus on in conversations going forward. And we think that provides opportunities for us to grow.
Operator: Our last question comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I think most of the questions have been answered here. Could you maybe give us an update on the competition that you're seeing in the anatomic pathology business?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. Pathology, in general, hasn't changed a lot. I'm often asked the question given the substantial cuts last year in reimbursement, has there been a change of some of the movement we've seen with in-sourcing at hospitals. And what I have said in the past, I'll say it again today, there's not a notable change in the marketplace. We continue to be a market leader in that regard. We think it's an important part of our business. It's very strategic to our oncology clinical franchise, and so we're deeply committed to it. But we also know, and others are in the middle of it along with us, is with the reimbursement cuts last year, it's a much more difficult business to make money at and we're working through what we need to do to be successful with it long term.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe going back to the comments you made on the assumptions for pricing in guidance and specifically on the SGR fix. Is there some pressure that you're quantifying in the guidance or would that all be incremental to the guidance if there were any cuts to lab reimbursement as part of any health-care legislation?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Mark will take this one. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Certainly it was taken into our thinking as we gave the guidance. I'm not going to share with you what was our explicit point estimate for what the SGR might be, but as we looked at all of the drivers and the distribution of potential outcomes, we took that into account before we came out and gave that guidance of flat to down 2%.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Guinan. In addition, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jon Cohen will be joining us for Q&A. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'd like to start by taking us through the top line performance, share our thoughts on utilization and reimbursement trends as well as review progress against our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide detail on the results. Well, first, clearly, our third quarter performance was disappointing. We recognized that we have missed expectations this year and revised our guidance more than once. We understand it is extremely important to achieve expectations, and we are focused on improving our predictability. Our current view reflects 2 changes, the impact of a softer market than we originally expected and the fact that our strategy to reserve growth is taking longer to produce results. Before commenting further, I'd like to welcome Mark Guinan, our new CFO. Mark brings strong financial operations experience to Quest, providing us with a fresh perspective on how we can improve our performance and predictability. Mark and I are already deeply engaged in driving shareholder value by executing our 5-point strategy. Now let's turn to the market dynamics. All year, we have been saying that we anticipated continued revenue softness in the first half of this year, and that our efforts to restore growth would result in gradual improvement during the back half of this year. Although we have seen a gradual improvement in performance versus the prior year, our third quarter performance was less than we expected. As a result, we fell short of expectations for the period by approximately $50 million. As we all have seen from commentary from industry stakeholders including hospitals, physicians, payers, suppliers, competitors, the healthcare industry overall is facing utilization headwinds. At the start of this year, our expectation was that 2013 would have about the same level of utilization we saw in 2012. In the first half, we saw clear signs that health care utilization had declined versus last year and at this point it appears this trend continued. As we reported to you last week, despite seeing some hopeful signs early in the quarter, volume softened late in the quarter. Overall, despite the soft finish to the quarter, volumes remained in line with our previous run rate as organic volumes. Adjusted for our business days, they were lower by 2% versus the prior year. As I said earlier, in addition to the continued soft market, our initiatives to restore growth that we've been planning on to contribute in the quarter are taking longer to show results. Additionally, this industry also faces considerable and ongoing pressure on reimbursement. In 2013, reimbursement challenges have become much more pronounced. This includes the reductions in Medicare payments of approximately 5%; the cuts to pathology codes on Medicare physician fee schedule; the changes to Medicare fee schedules, including requirements from molecular diagnostics; and finally, the effects of renewed commercial payer contracts. These changes, just this year, contributed to the lowering of underlying revenue per requisition by 3.3% in the third quarter compared to 2012. We now expect underlying revenue per requisition before acquisitions to be down a similar percentage for the full year. On a full year basis, our price erosion will be greater than $200 million in 2013. Also, we're going to see traders [ph] association has been fighting additional cuts that have been proposed or discussed. This includes a measure to extend the fixed rate reduction of the clinical lab fee schedule through 2023, as mentioned in the President's budget proposal in April. And CMS has proposed significant changes to the physician fee schedule and a mechanism to adjust to clinical lab fee schedule in the future, as was reported in July. We are operating in a challenging environment, at the same time, we are making the changes to the way we operate. Together, these factors have affected our progress to restore growth. Now let me give you an update on our efforts and the progress we're making executing our 5-point business strategy. First, let me start by looking at how we are refocusing on Diagnostic Information Services. We have made significant progress on our portfolio review. Since last year, we sold our OralDNA dental diagnostics business, HemoCue diagnostic products business, ibrutinib royalty rights and, most recently, Enterix, all jittering gross proceeds of approximately $800 million, providing us flexibility to drive shareholder value. Our portfolio review is helping us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Our commitment is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and, in September, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase approximately $350 million of our shares and then, finally, year-to-date, we have deployed nearly $1 billion in share repurchases. In addition, our goal is to generate about 1% to 2% revenue growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. So far, we have completed 4 acquisitions, including the lab outreach business of University of Massachusetts and Dignity Health as well as Concentra's toxicology business and, most recently, ConVerge. Our first 3 acquisitions are on track and contributed 2% to revenues in the third quarter. In October, we completed the acquisition of ConVerge, our second this year in the New England market. Next, we're making progress driving operational excellence. With Invigorate, we are on track to realize more than $200 million in savings this year and remain committed to our goal of $600 million in run rate savings next year on a path to $1 billion beyond 2014. This strategy, in addition to making us more efficient, will also allow us to improve our customer experience. Now most importantly, we are building the capabilities we need to restore growth. Our commercial reorganization is complete. As we have said, restoring growth is a gradual process and it takes time. We have made investments on our clinical franchises and the laboratory professional services business. These investments are critical to helping us restore growth. The clinical franchises are beginning to deliver new solutions to meet customer needs and will help us grow esoteric and advanced diagnostic solutions. To give you an example, we're very excited to introduce BRCAvantage, a new choice of BRCA testing, that's intended to significantly broaden patient and provider access to testing for BRCA gene mutations associated with increased risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Quest BRCAvantage is based upon next gen sequencing technology, an expertise of cancer genetics and women's health matched by none and a rich service approach designed to better health care experience for the patient and the clinician. Our laboratory professional services team continues to expand its pipeline for hospitals of integrated delivery networks that are interested in working with us to improve outcomes and reduce costs. And then finally, we also continue to simplify the organization and build a culture so we can improve our operations and grow. We built an organizational structure to better service our customers by removing complexity, speeding decision-making and empowering employees. Along with this, we introduced new behaviors that will make us more agile, customer-focused, transparent, collaborative and performance-oriented. This week's launch of BRCAvantage demonstrates the power of our new organization and culture. Our key ancillary clinical franchise team work collaboratively with colleagues across our enterprise as well as externally with customers, suppliers and key opinion leaders to quickly develop and introduce this important solution. We're looking forward to launching many more successful solutions in the future. While we are in a difficult operating environment, we are taking the right actions to make our company a stronger and more effective competitor. We are making progress and recognize that there is much more to do. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: Thanks, Steve. As you and I have discussed, I have several priorities for the finance function. These include improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our 5-point strategy, starting with improving operations and restoring growth. I can assure the investment community that I recognize the importance of delivering on guidance, and we will instill the discipline to improve our predictability. I don't like surprises and recognize that investors like them even less than I do. Turning to revenues. Third quarter of consolidated revenues, $1.79 billion or 1.9% below the prior year. Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2.4% below the prior year. Volume was better than the prior year by 2%. Our first 3 acquisitions completed this year: UMass, Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business contributed approximately 2% in the quarter to revenues and approximately 3% to volume, in line with expectations. Volume also benefited by approximately 1% due to favorable business days. Underlying volume, excluding business days and acquisitions, was lower by approximately 2%. As we have shared previously, we expected this year to be a building year and we expected to build momentum and show improvement later in the year. Revenue per acquisition in Q3 was down 4.3% compared to the prior year. The impact of our 2 second quarter acquisitions, principally Concentra's toxicology business, lowered revenue per requisition by approximately 1% in the quarter, resulting in a decrease in underlying revenue per acquisition of approximately 3.3%. While under pressure all year from government and commercial payers, reimbursement was also impacted this quarter by increased denial rates and unfavorable test mix, both of which are related to molecular tests and coding changes made this year. Q3 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, Clinical Trials testing, Healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were favorable to the prior year by 4.1%. Adjusted operating income was 16.5% of revenues, about 260 basis points below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues. A significant portion of the lower revenue is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiatives. However, we are operating in an environment in which we continue to make investments in advance of the revenues we expect. For example, we are investing in clinical franchises in areas like cancer and women's health to develop and launch solutions like BRCAvantage. We are also making investments in our lab professional services offering, which is an important element of our long-term strategy to restore growth. We expected volume growth in the current year to fund some of these investments. While they have not, we have not slowed down the pace of investing. Also, keep in mind that Invigorate includes volume-based productivity improvements. While we remain confident we will deliver $250 million or more than the current year, the volume decline we've experienced has prevented us from realizing even more of the productivity savings we had expected. Adjusted EPS of $1.02 was $0.13 below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues, partially offset with cost savings realized from Invigorate and the benefits of our share repurchase program. As a result of the company's ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, restructuring and integration costs of $39 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.2% and reported EPS by $0.16. Last year's third quarter included $44 million of cost associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.4% and reported EPS by $0.17. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6% or 30 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase can be partially attributed to benefit plan design as patients shoulder an increasing portion of health care costs. DSOs were 48 days, essentially unchanged from the second quarter. Cash from operations was $186 million in the quarter compared to $395 million in the prior year. This is principally due to the following factors: adjusted operating income was lower by $54 million; higher cash in the prior year period due to a nonrecurring $72 million cash received upon termination of an interest rate swap agreement; increase in the size and the timing of tax payments of $38 million in 2013; and higher restructuring and integration payments in 2013 of $15 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter compared to $45 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.2 million common shares. So far this year, we've repurchased almost 1 billion of our stock. Turning to guidance. We are updating guidance based on our performance year-to-date, the current operating environment, which we do not expect to materially improve and based on updates from our business leaders. We expect full year 2013 results from continuing operations before special items to be as follows: revenues to be approximately 3.5% below 2012, prior guidance was to be about 1% to 2% below the prior year level; earnings per diluted share to be between $3.85 and $3.95 compared with prior guidance of $4.35 to $4.50; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million compared to prior guidance that it would approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures unchanged to approximately $250 million. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, 2013 is a building year for Quest. We are focusing on implementing our 5-point strategy in the challenging environment with a particular emphasis on our strategies to restore growth. This will require us to improve our execution. Our recent BRCAvantage launch demonstrates Quest's ability to empower better health with diagnostic insights. And this illustrates a great example of our innovation will help us restore growth. Despite the current tough environment, we believe we operate in a very attractive market, and our 5-point strategy positions Quest to deliver superior shareholder value. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Steve, I guess, starting off with -- one of the things that you guys called out in your press release last week was the 50 basis-point impact from increased denials on the molecular test. Will you be able to recoup the 50 basis points that was lost at some point or is that gone forever?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, good question, Kevin. Let's give you a little more clarity on what we were talking about there. It has to do with really denials for our diagnostic-related charges that are in this molecular diagnostic category. And as you know, there's been quite some discussion in the past about this code stacking and then also the new proposals. And we've commented in the past, we think, on the price side, we were okay. And then, actually, we got into the quarter and we see some issues associated with getting paid. So I'm going to turn it to Dan to give us a little more color on the specifics of what we saw and how much of that could come back to us.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, sure thing. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. As we think about the molecular diagnostics issue and we think about pricing in general, first, let me say this. We said that reimbursement pressure would be about 3% in the year from government commercial payers, if it continues to be in that zone, so that we should be -- we're still in line with -- in terms of fee schedule erosion. We also share, when you think about revenue per requisition, that we see some favorable test mix and test per requisition, and that would be offset by some unfavorable business mix issues, okay, as our wellness and toxicology business has continued to grow. In this quarter, we saw a deterioration in the overall revenue per requisition, not necessarily fee schedule-related, but more due to test mix as well as the molecular diagnostics issues. And when we think about the molecular diagnostics issues, it has turned into -- resulted in a softer test mix benefit than originally anticipated. And as we look to those denials, some of the denials are related to some tests that we recently launched during the course of the year and have been growing, so we'll see some unfavorability there versus expectations. And then also, we do, as you know, perform reference testing for about half the hospitals around the country. We've had some clients that have started to see denials on their end a little bit later and, in an effort to maintain their profitability, have started to alter their ordering patterns, okay? And as they've altered some of those ordering patterns, we've seen changes, again, in our -- it would show up in our test mix. So denials, probably on their end, that resulted in softer test mix. So some of this -- is there an opportunity to continue to work this and get some improvement in the future? We will be working it and hope to get some improvements. But at this point, it's early to say, and we know the prudent thing to do would be to record our revenues right where they are.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful, Dan. But you mentioned you launched some new tests this year. I was just wondering if some of those tests have CPT codes assigned or are those tests -- I mean how big of an issue was that? And should we expect this kind of 50 basis-point headwind to continue?
Dan Haemmerle: I would expect some portion of it to continue to the end of the year.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Steve, just going back to your prepared comments, you talked about weaker utilization this year. You saw it in the first half and in the latter part of the quarter impacting your volumes. I was just wondering, what makes you think this is an industry issue? Obviously, we thought -- I'm on the same page, I think, overall utilization is a little weaker. But do you think there's any company-specific issues here? I mean could you guys be losing share to some of the smaller labs or even the hospital-based labs?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Good question, Kevin. So we -- and, obviously, you're looking at what's happening in the marketplace and the results are starting to come in. So on the utilization front, as I said in my prepared remarks, and I've shared this with you before, we entered the year thinking that it will be about the same levels as we had last year and, in fact, it's been worse. We expected that Q3 would be similar to what we saw in the first 2 quarters. And actually, as we have seen regarding to the quarter, beginning of the quarter, we actually were encouraged. And then as we got through midpoint of the quarter, it started to slow down. And we actually have gone back and looked at kind of our underlying business. Operationally, I talked about our reorganization of our sales force, we're putting more focus on operational excellence. Yes, that's about efficiency but, as importantly, it's about enhancing our customer experience. And when we look at our underlying performance and if you look at the key measures and if you go back and look at -- we do look at this sort of top 1,000 accounts and say, "What is happening between Q2 and Q3? Is there anything exceptional in there?" What we see is less utilization. Also, when you go back and look at sort of where we might be picking up accounts or where we might be getting some defections related to hospital in-sourcing, it was about where we expected. So the big change, really, for the quarter is related to our belief that some of the programs we've put in place with our sales force, with our new products and with our professional services business would yield more than what we delivered, and that's the $50 million I commented to. But overall, if you look at the marketplace, and if you look at how we compete with regional labs, how we compete with some of the national -- large national labs, we look at our customer experience, we look at our product offering, we look at our access, there's no notable change in that. And actually, we are improving as our plan -- as it's improving throughout the year. So that's our take on the quarter. Obviously, we're still digging into exactly what's happening in each of the regions, what's happening by each of our payer types, what's happening by product category, and we'll have more knowledge about it as we go forward. But as we sit right now, that's our perspective on the quarter.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then one last question here, Steve. So apparently, there has been some guideline changes for women's health on the paps. Just wondering if you guys have had a chance to assess how much of an impact do you think this will have on your women's health testing business?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. The guideline changes for pap.
Jon R. Cohen: Yes. The guideline changes...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: This is Jon Cohen.
Jon R. Cohen: Sorry, it's Jon. As you know, these guideline changes do change to more than -- to less frequently than 1 year. And I think, in general, everyone is going to see some decrease in pap testing as a result of that, as physicians, particularly OBs and primary care, begin to seriously engage with the new guidelines that we're offering.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Tom Gallucci [ph], FBR.
Unknown Analyst: I guess, just on the volumes, for my first question then I'll ask a follow-up. Curious about the trend that you're saying you saw there was a little stronger in the first part of the quarter and weaker in the second part. Just trying to understand the magnitude of the dropoff that you saw or exactly what you're relaying here in terms of the trend.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Well, we are starting to get some data back from some of the industry watchers. And it appears that things did drop off in terms of physician visits in September more than what we had seen at the beginning of the quarter, so that's tracking with what we experienced. And second is I just saw -- we just are digesting some hospital admission data and it looks like the same happened on the hospital side, too. So it was tracking, actually, in the first part of the quarter, Tom, better than what we had experienced in the first half, and then it went to a place that was lower than what we saw in the first half. So -- and on average, it's about what we saw in the first half. But we were hopeful in the early part of the quarter that things were actually improving somewhat versus what we had experienced in the past. So it's our best perspective on this, and we're trying to understand how much of this is the market, the environment, utilization, what could have been the causes for that and also what has -- Kevin asked earlier, what portion of it is us versus the competition versus what we expected versus our plans, so we're going through all that. But as we sit right now, the biggest shortfall in the quarter is related to not executing as well, is the programs that we put in place and that we had planned on in our guidance, and that's the $50 million. When we got through the quarter, you can say when the dust settles, it was a little better than the first part of the quarter, less in -- that part of the quarter overall utilization was about, for the quarter, what we have seen in the past 2 quarters. That's not it. But we actually had planned on getting more out of our restored growth initiatives. And as we said, they're still valid. We have the resources in place. It's just going to take more time for us to see the benefits of those.
Mark J. Guinan: And I just want to add -- it's Mark -- a majority of the $50 million miss came in September, so -- and I do want to make that clear. And historically, September has been a strong month for us. So we were actually, based on where we were at early in the quarter, we were expecting some momentum in September and we saw the dropoff. Now back to Steve's point, when you look at the quarter in total, the overall health of the business, frankly, utilization was pretty consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year. So while September was disappointing, when you look at it in light of the whole quarter, it seemed like it just was a continuation of the year. But earlier in the quarter, we felt like things were turning.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. Is that new guidance just to clarify, is more of a run rate that you saw in September or is it really the average for the quarter?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Mark?
Mark J. Guinan: It's really looking at the quarter. We're not building off September and assuming that's indicative of what the balance of the year will be.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. My bigger picture sort of follow-up was just on use of cash. Obviously, you guys are describing a difficult environment. You bought back a lot of stock, you've done some acquisitions. In the environment that we're in, how do you sort of think about the visibility you have on acquisitions performing or on your own business performing and the stock being a good use of cash versus doing dividends or acquisitions in different lines of businesses? I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the use of cash in this difficult environment.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. We're committed to our 5-point strategy. And as we look at the acquisitions, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, they're on track, so the 3 that we actually integrated at this point. So we continue to feel that's a good use of cash. And in terms of other use of cash, whether it's dividend or share buybacks, we've said we're going to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders and we're going to continue along that strategy.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the Invigorate cost savings. So I think that the implied guidance assumes about $160 million to $170 million of incremental savings in the second half of the year. And when we kind of like think about the business, the acquisitions, doing back of the envelope analysis, we get to Invigorate incremental savings of around $60 million to $65 million in the quarter. So I just wanted to confirm that. And should we -- is it reasonable to think that you're going to see another kind of like 40% of sequential uptick in the savings that you're seeing coming through in the fourth quarter?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So let me go through what we said before and my perspective, and I'll turn it to Mark to round it off. Well, first of all, what we have shared is that we have a goal of $600 million run rate savings by the end of 2014, so we're standing behind that as I said in my prepared remarks. We actually are encouraged by the rate of change we're making with Invigorate, and we need it to offset the headwinds we have in this industry. And as we said before, we have our foot on the accelerator to get as much out of it as possible, so that continues. What we also have shared is that last year, in 2012, we were exiting about $200 million run rate and we've never provided a run rate for 2014 -- 2013, but what we have said is that we would save -- deliver savings $250 million this year. We are well on our way to save that this year, that's $250 million. We also said, as you recall, about twice as much in the back half than the front half. So if you go through the math, as you have done, Ricky, that would save -- that would be somewhere in that range that you discussed. But also it says, given the rapid pace of improvement that we're making on our cost structure, there is a ramp, and that ramp means that we'll have a ramp going into the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So with that as just refreshing our guidance on this, I'll turn it to Mark to round it off.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes, sure. Ricky, as I mentioned again in my prepared remarks, some of the Invigorate savings is volume-dependent. And we were tracking actually ahead of our plan in the first half of the year, and we're expecting to deliver something north of the $250 million that we communicated externally. As volumes have softened, we're expecting to still meet our commitment of over $250 million, but not quite reach the levels that we had thought and had projected and built into our expectations for the full year. So therefore, the ratio of first half to second half has been impacted by 2 things: one was that the overall savings are not going to be quite as high as we'd hoped to achieve, but still exceed what we committed externally, the $250 million; the second thing is that we actually were tracking ahead in the first half, and that ratio could have held true if we had achieved our stretch targets for the year. But since we aren't, the ratio is going to be a little bit different.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that is helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, regarding the code stacking kind of like reimbursement delays, does this relate only to Medicare or are you also seeing some of that's playing over to the commercial side?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Dan, why don't you take that?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. We have seen it with other payers in -- on the commercial side, Medicaid side. And keep in mind, as you go through this with different payers in different states, even on the Medicaid side, different payers are implementing on different timelines and they're taking different approaches to this. But we still have some payers in different states that were actually billing with the old coding system, okay? And so we expected that some of these will continue to move but, at this point, we are seeing it across multiple payers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Bonello, Craig-Hallum.
William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division: A question and a follow-up. I want to revisit something you kind of touched on earlier, but maybe push you a bit more on it. I guess I'm kind of flummoxed by the degree of attention that you are placing on sort of the challenging macro environment. I mean, if I look at your performance compared to the only other national lab, it's been incredibly divergent over the last 3 quarters, with you guys obviously performing significantly more poorly. And I guess, what I want to understand is how we can get comfortable that you're accurately assessing what problems really might be performance-based rather than macro-driven and what you might be doing to address those. And then I do have a follow-up.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: All right, Bill. Thanks for the question. First of all, we only have access to our data, and we see what you see in terms of our competitors and what competitor you're referring to. As you see and what we have said is that our underlying volumes, when you do all the adjustments and just look at the organic volume for Q3, it was down by about 2%, that's adjusting for days and adjusting for -- everything we adjust for with our acquisitions. And that's about at the same levels we have seen for the last 2 prior quarters. With that said, you then look at what we had expected from each of the different categories of our operation. We have different mixes of business and different areas of focus than some of our competitors. And I would say that in 2 dimensions, one from a product perspective or a service-line perspective and the second is from a geographic perspective. And so when you look through our business and you look at our pathology business, and there was earlier questions about pap smears, and there's a dynamic going on with that business, which we understand and we're trying to track. Second is, if you look at our overall business versus others in primary care versus specialty care, we're actually looking at a routine business versus our esoteric and advanced business. If we look at our payer mix, we're also quite interested, as you would expect, at what's happening with our prayer partners and how they're growing or not growing, and that could affect our performance as well. So you go through the whole calculus and all we can do is control what we do control. And so what we're focused on in our strategy to restore growth is number one, a better commercial organization or sales organization that does a better job calling on our customers to make sure that we have the best superior experience that we can for our customers that we can. This includes on how we sell to them, how do we service them and, in any length, some portion of this marketplace that is growing. And so that's why we put that in place. Second is we created an organization around clinical franchises. This clinical franchise organization is putting more emphasis of getting more solutions to the marketplace that is much more aligned with what you see from another portion of the marketplace that is growing, which is sometimes referred to as the boutique or specialized laboratories. Our BRCAvantage introduction this week is a great example of the new organization that we put in place. From the Supreme Court ruling in June to today, we sped up. Quickly, we get to this -- to the marketplace. We're quite excited about that as an introduction and we're encouraged by that. So again, we're controlling our own destiny. We're introducing more to the market at a faster pace than ever before. And then, finally, is we're building a professional services business. And I'll share with you, this is gathering traction. It's gathering traction because many hospitals and integrated delivery networks are quite interested on what their strategy is going forward and how we can help them with that. Some of that took the form of 2 acquisitions this year with hospital outreach, but you'll be hearing about more laboratory management and professional service relationships with a number of systems as we go forward because our funnel is building. So we're encouraged by that. So you look at, fundamentally, how does business go from one of our competitors to the other and vis-a-vis how we compete versus those competitors, we think we're focused on all the right things. We're focused on the things that are going to drive volumes. We also understand, and you understand, that we've had a significant reimbursement change this year. Our guidance this year is about 3% change in price. We have our fair share of the cuts in Medicare, which are outlined in my remarks, but also, we had a number of commercial contracts that anniversaried and we renegotiated those terms, and that's in the 3%. So if you look at the top line and you look at price erosion for us versus some others, we had a year where we paid out, if you will, in price concessions about $200 million, and we're offsetting that as well. So we believe that we're working on the right things. We're disappointed by Q3. We do believe it's a difficult market with a lot of headwinds. However, we need to work on the things we do control. We believe our 5-point strategy. If you look through the 5-point strategy as the right strategy, if you look at the results, 4 of those points are tracking very well. The one we're disappointed in is our strategy to restore growth. We think those initiatives that are outlined are the right initiatives. Where you look at the marketplace and look at where people are growing, what I just outlined there is what is going to make a difference for us so that we do restore growth. So that's my best summary of what we've done vis-a-vis the market and vis-a-vis the competition.
William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up related to that. You've been here a couple of years now. In light of what you believe to be an extremely difficult macro environment and in light of the challenges that you still have in front of you, trying to cut costs and make some pretty significant operational changes while also trying to restore volume growth, I mean have you given any thought to -- that maybe these are things that would better be achieved as a private company? And are you exploring strategic alternatives at all? Any openness on the Board to a sale where there hasn't been in the past?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Okay, Bill. So first of all, I started here in May 2012. So time does go by fast, but not that fast, so not quite 2 years. But in relation to your question, this is a tough environment. However, we do believe we operate in a very attractive market and we do believe that our 5-point strategy positions Quest very well to deliver superior shareholder value. And with that said, we do believe we're operating in the right way. We believe we are making the proper investments. We do believe that our plan is the best value-creation plan irregardless of our ownership, so that's our focus, is our 5-point strategy in building shareholder value.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Mark, just wanted to go back to one of the things that you had said, maybe just to get some clarification. You had mentioned that the Invigorate savings were, at least, in part, volume-dependent. And so some of those soft volumes had been slowing that down. Can you just talk a little bit more about what the exact relationship is there?
Mark J. Guinan: Sure. Within our cost structure, obviously, there's fixed costs and variable costs, Gary, and we're not just saving on fixed costs, we're also saving on the rate on our variable costs. So therefore, the dollar figure that we've been quoting was based on a certain level of volume revenue. And as we have less volume, obviously, the dollar, not the proportional savings, on our variable cost is going to be lower.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's -- that make sense, that's helpful. And then Steve, you had mentioned, I don't know if you'd threw or put this number out there before, sort of the $200 million in price concessions this year, can you characterize those to some extent or is there anything that you could have done differently? Maybe you did not have to have -- have had those, and sort of where are we in terms of those anniversarying so that maybe the impact isn't quite as much on a year-over-year basis?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So let me open it up and turn it to Dan to round it off. First of all, we have said from the beginning of this year that our price erosion will be 3%. So then you go through the 3%, 3% on our business is greater than $200 million, so it's consistent. We haven't shared the exact $200 million, but it is a big number for us and that's what we planned on. As you know, we have a pretty -- we have a very good line of sight on our pricing. It's a good part about this business. Why do we have a good line of sight? We knew what was going to happen with Medicare. We actually planned in that guidance for sequestration. It wasn't certain, but we wanted to make sure we plan for the worst and hope for the better. So -- and we have shared in our remarks that Medicare was about $50 million of that $200 million, roughly. Now that excludes, and on top of, you need to include the pathology cuts, okay? And the pathology cuts were up sort of substantial, that's 52% of the technical fee and that was a considerable portion of the $200 million this year. And the remainder is related to our price concessions with the commercial payers. Some of that had started in 2012 and carried over into 2013. We had a few renegotiations this year. We actually had shared in our second quarter call that we renegotiated, and we're very happy with our renewed contract with CIGNA going forward, and that's in the 3% or the $200 million for this year. And -- but what we also said, when we were in Investor Day last November, is that we expect, over a 3-year period, that price erosion would be about 1% to 2% over that 3-year period. And what we have also shared is that there is going to be more in 2013 than there will be in 2014 and 2015 as a percentage. However, we still have headwinds associated with all the discussion we're having in Washington around further Medicare cuts as I outlined in my remarks. That's how it all fits together. You asked, "Is there anything you would have done better?" Well, we're going to push -- as a trade association, I would say that the effort we're mounting in Washington to offset any actions to get further cuts beyond what we baked in is happening, so we're aggressively working on that. I sit on the board of ACLA. Dave King is the Chair, I'm the Vice Chair, we're actively working on this with members of the industry to make sure our voice is heard. We think that this industry is, I repeat, substantial yet. We are an industry that represents about 70% of health care decision-making. For Medicare, we represent about 2% of costs. In a world that you're worried about better patient outcomes and getting more data, we're part of the solution to how you make that happen. And if you look at these cuts that are being proposed going forward, not just for us and for our nearest competitor, but if you look at this marketplace with a lot of small regional players, it will be substantial for those regional players since they have a higher percentage of Medicare. So we think we have a strong argument. Our voice is being heard, and we're working on that. On the commercial side, we're working actively with our commercial insurance partners. As I said when I started in this job, I'm actively engaged with many of them. That's a key part of our business. I see health care insurance as part of a -- the transformational link effort in this country. We're making progress with them on how we bring more value to their membership, how we work with them to narrow their networks, to save them money and get us more revenues, which is an opportunity that we both enjoy, so we're working that. So overall, it's about what we expected for the year. The only change is, again, related to the earlier comments about what happened with molecular diagnostics and the coding, which is on top of, if you will, the 3% price concession guidance that we've given for the year. So Dan, would you like to round up my comments?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. I think you've touched on most of it. The only other question I think I heard in there was around contracts anniversarying. And so we do have contracts that our anniversarying in the back half of the year, both third and fourth quarter. So some of it happened in third quarter, we'll see a little more in the fourth quarter.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And maybe could you just throw -- you'd also mentioned that you thought it was going to take more time for the growth initiatives to kick in. How does that sort of fit into the comments that you made?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, it's what was the big difference between the third quarter expectations that we've set and what we delivered. And we have the 3 initiatives that we have outlined, those are our priorities for this year: more volume from a better sales organization or commercial organization; second is more coming from products and our clinical franchise organization; and then, finally, is our professional services business. We've gone through the organizational change last fall, we've staffed into place in the first quarter. We have plans and, obviously, part of those plans are making some modest investments in our sales force, our clinical franchises and building our professional services team. We have actually made those investments. We feel good about the progress. We feel good about the prospects that are building and we expected some of those to land in the third quarter. But unfortunately, it did not happen. It doesn't change our confidence, our confidence around what we're working on, our confidence about the market opportunities, our confidence about what we can get in this market as we continue to focus on the things we're focused on in our strategy. And we are making progress, but it will take longer.
Operator: Our next question is from Glen Santangelo of Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just have a couple of questions. First is around the implied guidance for the fourth quarter. It looks like you're using the midpoint of your range and looking for $0.93 in the fourth quarter, which is down almost 10% from what you reported this quarter. And given the benefits you have from accruing from share repurchase, from some of the recent acquisitions and some of the Invigorate savings, what are you implying, I guess, with respect to organic trends? I mean, where are we going to see incremental deterioration in 4Q versus 3Q levels?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Mark? Thanks, Glen.
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Glen, I'll try to answer that for you, thanks for the question. Historically, as you look at Q4, it does tend to be a softer quarter than Q3 given the seasonality. I mean, you've got the holidays. As you look at overall billing days, et cetera, there's definitely a reason to suggest a softer revenue quarter even without any trend break in terms of reqs per day and revenue per req and all that. So it's really just taking into account the days that fall within Q4. No significant change in business momentum other than a little bit more lift we're building in for some of the initiatives that Steve talked about. So we're not abandoning our belief that those investments are going to turn the tide. We just are getting a little more conservative, less aggressive in how quickly that will happen. And we're basing that on what we saw in the third quarter.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then maybe if I could just look forward to 2014. I can imagine you don't want to comment on 2014 at this point, but maybe could you at least address that Affordable Care Act? Have you done any sort of internal analysis in terms of what you think that could ultimately mean, how much you think it could help volumes? Any sort of high-level commentary you can give it at this point?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, Glen. Well, last quarter, as you know, we talked a fair amount about Affordable Care Act. And what we shared is it's taking more time to develop than we originally had expected. We still believe that is -- that the Affordable Care Act is net positive. Net positive for this industry and net positive for us. And the simple underlying principle why that is, is because there's going to be more lives with insurance. And when more people have insurance, they're going to need what we do. Now as you know, with all the change that has happened, this has been muted. Only half of the states have expanded their Medicaid program, which was an entry point for the lives. We all know that the exchanges have been more problematic, but I will also share that we're negotiating with many of the commercial payers on their exchanges. We actually feel good about that. But as you hear and will hear from health care insurance companies, they're being cautious about their ramp into the exchange world. And also you know about all the issues associated with the government exchanges. And then third is with the employer mandate being pushed out. And again, this is another piece of where the growth would come from that is taking this out by a year or so. We had all expected, as we entered 2013, that 2014 would be a year where we'd see some of the benefits, that is, more lives into the system, and more lives in the system, we would benefit from that, and that's, clearly, been pushed out. However, we still believe that the train has left the station. We still believe that more lives will be insured with a variety of products. And we still believe that, in the end, when people have insurance and have access to the health care system, it'll be net positive for this industry and net positive for us. So Dan, anything you like to do to round that off?
Dan Haemmerle: No. I think you touched on most of it again. I think the exchange piece, as we said, we've been negotiating with a number of commercial payers. We're pleased with how those progressed so far, and we have a number of contracts that we've signed. A lot of this will depend on which -- who the big winners and losers are in exchanges in different markets and how many lives are signing up in terms of how it impacts the business. But overall, the rates we're seeing are generally in line with some of the commercial rates that we've seen in our existing contracts to this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe just following up and talking about fourth quarter expectations. I appreciate that on the -- income statement-wise, it looks pretty -- or even maybe a little conservative, but your cash flow assumption, you're going to need a pretty big pickup in cash flow in the fourth quarter to hit your target for the year. And I just wondered, is there some items that are going to swing in the fourth quarter that are going to drive -- I think you need more than $400 million to hit your target. And I just -- what's the thinking there, and any impact on capital deployment decisions given a little lower cash flow expectation?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. A.J., let's turn that to Mark.
Mark J. Guinan: We haven't changed any of our capital deployment plans. And in terms of what's going to give us some uplift in Q4, it's really the -- it's -- the DSOs to a certain extent are a contributor. We had a delay in getting our Medicare provider number and -- for some of our acquisitions. And so we're highly confident that that's going to take place and we're going to get paid. But at this point, that's really been the driver and the spike in our DSOs in Q3 -- in Q2 and Q3, and we expect that to be resolved in Q4.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. On the commentary about expecting sort of pricing pressure, 1% to 2% annually for the next few years, maybe just to put it in perspective, to sort of maintain margin or even start to talk about expanding margin, what kind of -- give us a sense of what kind of volume growth you need in light of that pricing environment to sort of hold margin constant or even begin to expand at all?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I appreciate that, A.J. Well, when you go through the facts that we had in 2013, which was a substantially larger year than what we anticipate in 2014 and 2015, so we'll have less headwinds from pricing in 2014 than we clearly saw in 2013, that's number one. Number two, is we continue to talk about the acceleration and improvements that we're making on our cost structure with Invigorate. It continues to build, it hasn't stopped. We exited 2012, that $200 million we talked about. $600 million in 2014 is the exit, and we're tracking to exiting at our rate in 2012 and we're going to be on a path to get to the 2014 number that we have committed to. So that's tracking nicely. Third is we have a little bit of headwind, as you would expect, on our wage bill. We have to be competitive with our workforce and so we have to dial that into our expectations. And we continue to build our 1% to 2% top line of opportunities with acquisitions, which is part of our disciplined capital deployment. As you see in the back half of this year, A.J., we actually are now, in the third quarter, at 2% of our top line. So we are getting to the higher end of the range. And as you know, we do these acquisitions, with a large part of those acquisitions based upon cost synergies. As we work through their integration plans -- and some of those integration plans are short, short as 6 months, and some others as large as 2 years, when it's more complicated -- it builds our profitability from those acquisitions, so we have that flowing through in 2014. So I can't give you the specific color of 2014, and we won't do it at this call, but we're still tracking of where we think our 5-point strategy will allow us to build shareholder value. And we do believe it's still compelling as we keep on working through this. As you know, it's always more difficult to get the results with the headwinds and the challenging environment that we see. And if that improves, we're not planning on the significantly sunnier day, if you will, in the short-term. But the challenging environment is making it more difficult, and that challenging environment will improve. And then with the Affordable Care Act, with more lives in the system, because we do believe there will be more lives in the system, and that this marketplace is growing, we do believe we're in an attractive marketplace and we do believe that our 5-point strategy will give us lift as we go forward in 2014 and 2015 with our earnings and also with the opportunity to build shareholder value. So we will keep you posted on when we'll provide insight into 2014, but that is as much color as we can provide at this time.
Operator: Our last question comes from Amanda Murphy, William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I have a couple of follow-up questions on the volume. Just a couple of questions on the volume side. I know we've talked a lot about it but, obviously, you've mentioned some of the underlying utilization trends. But one question I had was, you've made changes on the management side as well. I'm curious, did that have any effect on the business in terms of volume trends?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, it's a good question and, obviously, we're going through territory by territory, understanding where we see effects, can we explain it. We've taken out a sizable portion of management throughout the entire company. As I shared with you, we had to do it. One is we had a very complicated organizational structure. It was not aligned with our 2 highest priorities, which are operational excellence as well as restoring growth. We now have an organizational structure that is leaner and is much more focused on those 2 priorities. And in doing that, we've taken out 3 management layers. And actually, we did this because we spent a lot of time inside talking to ourselves, and one of our behavior changes that we are driving is to get more external. And so if you take out 3 management layers, which we have done, we're spending less time talking to ourselves and more time talking to customers. And it starts with me and my entire management team and throughout the organization. So when you refer to management, I actually think our management changes has actually improved our ability to get outside, and our management today is much more externally focused than before, number one. Number two, though, is you go through a reorganization of the sales force, and these are at the sales rep level. We had to change our sales force organization to put an organizational structure that are more aligned with the way our customers are organizing. As you know, Amanda, customers are organized around integrated delivery networks, they include hospitals, they include physicians, they include ancillary services. And so, we now have a geographic organization. We've made those changes. We did have some account assignments in the first quarter that we had to change to get a more effective organization, and we feel good about that. We did incent our sales force to make sure any changes between the accounts, between sales reps would be handled properly. We don't see a substantial defections or losses in accounts because of that. We do track our customer experience, and we think we're actually improving how we experience -- or our customers experience us. So when we go through all the data, we think we have made all the right changes. We believe that, when you get down to the granular level, they're actually moving in the right directions. But we haven't seen many things come out of some of the positive sides of these. We do expect more productivity from our sales reps, we expect our sales reps to be able to sell more, we expect them to be able to get more from our new products. And that's what we planned for in the $50 million expectation that we've set, so that's the disappointing side of Q3. This is a lot of change. We believe we are making the right changes and we are doing the right things, but it will take longer. So that's my best perspective I can give you on what we've done and how it's affected our business.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, got it. And just a broader question, obviously, the days has been, in just health care in general, has been challenged by lower utilization rates for quite a while now. So I mean, at what point do you say maybe this is a new normal and, if that's true, then I guess, that longer term, and you talk to M&A helping you supplement that growth, but how long is that runway?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, as you know, first of all, we're not planning on the environment changing abruptly or getting better quickly. You see that in our guidance for Q4, and that's what we should plan for. We believe that's being prudent. Second is, if we're seeing pressure, this whole industry is feeling pressure. If you look at the most broadly defined market, our sales and our nearest competitor represent about 20% of the market, 20% of that overall market, then has hospital outreach included in that. The reason why we're encouraged by the professional services business, many of the hospital clients we are now selling into are thinking about their lab strategy, which includes potentially selling their outreach business, the list continues to grow. They're also looking at us at helping them manage some of their inpatient laboratories or helping them with their outreach activities as well, and we are encouraged by that. And then finally, is if we look at the smaller players, the regional players in this marketplace, they have a much higher percentage of the business for Medicare, so with these cuts that we've seen this year and the potential cuts going forward, we think there is an opportunity for the strongest player, the leader, in this industry to continue to consolidate and gain share. And our plan, our 5-point strategy, addresses that. So we're moving forward on this strategy that we have to use some portion of our capital to get 1% to 2% top line for acquisitions. As I mentioned, we actually moved to the 2 side of that range in the third quarter. We are encouraged by that in the third quarter for the fourth quarter, and we continue to build our funnel. And there's a growing level of interest of parties that might consider selling. And also, we want to make sure that these are strategically aligned and accretive acquisitions as we go forward that helps build shareholder value. So that's my perspective. Mark, would you like to round that off?
Mark J. Guinan: Yes. Just one thing I'll -- I'd add. I mean, as -- I think we are seeing a rebasing, driven by a lot of changes that we're all familiar with. One could argue maybe there's overconsumption of health care and we're rebasing it. But at some point, you're rebased, and then we should be growing along demographic lines. When that point is? I'm not sure. I mean -- in addition to that, when you think about the desire to move from treatment to early detection or prevention, so it's our belief that diagnostics is a great part of that solution. So that's -- as Steve said in the end of his remarks, we believe this is a great space. Those are really the drivers. While we certainly have had a couple of tough years here, that's not looking like it's going to be over in the immediate term, we do think that, long term, this is a good space to be in and also, as Steve said, one that's likely to migrate to the highest quality, low-cost providers and we certainly expect ourselves to be there within this marketplace.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So this is a tough environment, we all know that. But we also, to our Mark Guinan's belief, this is very attractive market. There is the routine work that we do. But most importantly, we're investing in advanced and esoteric work. And I think our example this week of our launch of BRCAvantage is a great example where we'll be entering a market that is growing. It enters in a market where clearly more information and more insight is helpful to helping health care overall. And that's one of the areas of focus for us, is to make sure we introduce more innovative solutions to the market. And as we've talked, it's not just the diagnostic, it's the information, it's the services. And that's what will fuel new growth as we go forward. And when you look at those prospects, we believe this is a very attractive market despite the difficult environment we're operating in today.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and a question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and a text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I want to make sure that you have seen our recent announcements, so I want to touch on those briefly. You have all heard our news announcing our new CFO, Mark Guinan. Mark will be joining us on July 29. Bob Hagemann will remain as our CFO until Mark's arrival, and Bob has agreed to provide a smooth transition to Mark. Again, I'd like to thank Bob for his years of service to Quest Diagnostics. Given the timing of the transition, we thought it'd be best for Dan and myself to handle today's call. We look forward to introducing Mark to all of you during the third quarter. Second, we announced this morning that we have completed the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights for $485 million in cash. We'll talk more about these later in the call. But I'd like to take you through the top line performance, share our thoughts on reimbursement and utilization trends as well as health care reform and review progress against our 5-point strategy. And then, Dan will provide the details on our results. Since January, we have been saying that we anticipated continued revenue softness in the first half of this year and that our efforts to restore growth would result in gradual improvement through the rest of the year. So as expected, revenues and earnings improved from the first quarter levels but were below the prior year. We saw a continued revenue softness in the second quarter due to lower health care utilization, which impacted many health care providers, as well as reductions in our reimbursement. There are a number of factors that impacted our year-over-year comparisons. As you'll hear later from Dan, after considering those factors, our underlying volume was down about 1.5% versus the prior year. This compares to the first quarter, which was down about 2%. In addition, revenues per requisition decreased 3.7% in the second quarter, primarily due to the combination of Medicare cuts and commercial pricing. The impact of the acquisition of Concentra's toxicology business, coupled -- contributed approximately 50 basis points of the decrease. We continue to expect underlying revenue per requisition before acquisitions to be down about 3% for the full year. I'd like to discuss reimbursement, utilization pressures and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is -- which have all been in the news recently. Well, last week, CMS proposed significant changes to the physician fee schedule and a mechanism to adjust the clinical lab fee schedule in the future. Proposed reductions in Medicare reimbursement did not come as a complete surprise. We have been saying that there will be continuing pricing pressure in our industry and have been preparing for it. And this has been one of the driving forces behind our Invigorate cost-reduction initiative. The cuts proposed by Medicare last week could impact the industry and impact us. Reimbursement from services related to physician fee schedule for Medicare patients was approximately 3% of our 2012 consolidated revenues. However, the impact will be greater on smaller independent and hospital laboratories because they have a larger portion of Medicare business. I am participating with other industry leaders to proactively work with CMS regarding these proposals. Last fall, at Investor Day, we introduced our expectation for annual average reimbursement pressure of 1.2% over a 3-year period. We took into account the known Medicare price cuts, sequestration, forecasted commercial payer price changes and potential other government reimbursement changes. There have also been widespread signs that utilization is softer than last year. Physician office visits and hospital admissions in the first half of 2013 are below the first half of 2012. Additionally, payers have cited lower medical cost as a driver of improved performance. Finally, turning to the Affordable Care Act. It's now seemingly likely that the expected entry of the uninsured people into the health care systems will ramp up more slowly than initially anticipated. Less than half of the states are moving forward with Medicaid expansion, which was seen as a major entry point for the uninsured. In addition, the exchanges are taking longer to develop than originally anticipated. And then finally, the delay on the employer mandate will see slower implementations of ACA. We still believe that the Affordable Care Act will be net positive for the industry and for our company but will take longer to see the benefits initially than expected. But the longer term outlook for this market is attractive for a number of reasons: The population is aging and growing, more people will have access to health care, advances in genomics and advanced testing will lead to opportunities for personalized medicine, data analytics will improve quality and reduce costs and this industry continues to consolidate. We have said before that 2013 is a building year, that we are making solid progress executing our 5-point strategy and that we expect stronger performance in the second half. The improvement in the second half is expected to be driven by easier comparisons, the impact of acquisitions, the benefit of investments we have made to drive growth, the excellent progress we're making with our Invigorate cost-reduction initiatives and benefits from share repurchases. We believe that the progress we have made this year will position us for a stronger 2014 despite the slower implementation of health care reform. Now I would like to share a mid-year update on the progress we have been making, executing our 5-point business strategy. So let's start with driving operational excellence. The Invigorate cost-reduction initiative is on track to deliver substantial savings this year. To date, it has mitigated much of the bottom line impact of revenue softness. We are currently on track to deliver more than $250 million in realized savings in 2013 versus 2012. We have shared -- we expect twice as much in savings in the second half of the year than in the first half. In addition, we are tracking very well against our goal to deliver $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2014. We're taking advantage of our size and scale to improve quality and are committed to our challenge to increase the $600 million goal to $1 billion beyond 2014. The progress we are making on Invigorate flagship programs gives us confidence in the savings that we have projected. Last fall, we indicated that we had a highly complex organization that was not aligned with the market and our 2 highest priorities in the market, driving operational excellence and restoring growth. This complexity was also inefficient. We said we had too many management layers and would remove between 400 to 600 management positions, resulting in expected run rate savings of $80 million. We have essentially completed the elimination of at least 3 layers from the organization and have reduced approximately 450 management positions from the company to date, with approximately another 50 reductions to come by the end of the year. So we are on track to achieve our expected run rate savings goal. Invigorate initiatives are enabling us to do a better job driving efficiencies in purchasing, centralizing support functions so we can provide better customer service and rationalizing excess capacity in our laboratory network. We are also standardizing the way we manage data, the way we develop and use common business processes, enable them with enterprise IT systems. Next, we have taken actions to restore growth. The near-term focus is on bringing sales and marketing excellence to Quest Diagnostics. Second is growing our esoteric testing through our disease focus and finally, partnering with hospitals and IDMs. So let's take a look at each of these elements. Well, the reorganization of our sales force is complete. We have a different and simpler organization headed by new leaders. We have more salespeople who are better trained, better equipped, incented and more focused on calling on customers than before. We continue to make progress with our health plan relationships, and I am pleased that we have extended our relationship with CIGNA and look forward to a continued strong partnership with an innovative partner. We have also signed agreements with a number of payers for diagnostic services offered on the new health insurance exchanges that are an important part of health care reform. We're improving the way we introduce new esoteric Diagnostic Information Services and are developing new service offerings linked to our new disease focused clinical franchises. We have invested in building 7 clinical franchises, organized by specialty disease state, with each led by its own general manager. We believe this is more thoughtful and will bring better solutions to the market that will generate additional growth. To give you an example, our new Women's Health clinical franchise established our new strategic relationship with Hologic, which provides us an opportunity to ignite new business opportunities with a leader in women's health. This collaboration will focus primarily on cervical cancer and breast cancer. In addition, following the landmark Supreme Court decision on BRCA1 and 2, we're working to introduce a solution for breast cancer predisposition testing later this year. And then finally, our hospital professional services team continues to see interest building from integrated delivery networks. We have increased activity at all phases of the pipeline, from initial discussions to sharing data to due diligence and contracting. All these factors give us confidence we will see results from our efforts build throughout the remainder of the year. Our third strategy is to simplify the organization. We have deployed our new organization, shared corporate priorities, established new behaviors and are implementing a new management process with rewards and incentives. With our new organization, we now have a new senior management team comprised of the executives from the company when I joined in addition to the 5 new members since last year. These individuals all come from senior positions at major publicly traded companies that brings significant leadership experience. Notably, we have just announced our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Guinan. He comes to us with strong financial operational experience and we look forward to him joining us later this month. I'm confident that this new senior management team will instill the behaviors that we're looking for throughout the company. Our fourth strategy is to refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Service business. Last year, we sold OralDNA dental diagnostic business. During the first half, we sold HemoCue and began the process to evaluate the Celera drug assets and Celera's products business. We are pleased to complete today the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights to Royalty Pharma for $485 million in cash. We continue to hold the royalty rights for assets licensed to Pharmacyclics and Merck. Our portfolio review is resulting in asset sales that are providing additional flexibility for our fifth strategy, which is delivering disciplined capital deployment. Our plan is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The sale of HemoCue provided proceeds that helped us repurchase $405 million of shares in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date share repurchases to $467 million. We plan to use of the after-tax proceeds for the sale -- from the sale of ibrutinib royalty rights to drive shareholder value, consistent with our capital deployment strategy. In addition, we completed the acquisitions of the lab outreach business of Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business, consistent with our goal of contributing 1% to 2% revenue growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. Well, despite the difficult operating environment, this progress gives us confidence that we are making the appropriate improvements needed and that we will see the benefits build throughout the remainder of this year and thereafter. Now let's turn it over to Dan, and he'll go through the detailed analysis of the numbers. Dan?
Dan Haemmerle: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q2 consolidated revenues of $1.8 billion were 3.3% below the prior year but 1.6% better than Q1 2013. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 3.6% below the prior year. Volume was essentially flat, 0.1% better than a year ago. The 3 acquisitions completed this year, UMass, Dignity Health and Concentra's toxicology business, contributed approximately 1.6% in the quarter to volumes and are all on track versus our growth plans. The contribution from acquisitions was essentially offset by softness in our underlying volumes of approximately 1.5%. While underlying volumes were softer than a year ago, they are approximately 0.5% better than what we experienced in Q1 of this year. As we have shared previously, we expected to see continued volume softness in the first half of the year, with improvement in the second half due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and building momentum on our efforts to restore growth. Revenue per requisition in Q2 was down 3.7% compared to the prior year. The impact of our 2 recent acquisitions, principally Concentra's toxicology business, lowered revenue per requisition by approximately 0.5%. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our underlying revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by approximately 3.2%. This 3.2% reduction in underlying revenue per requisition is largely due to the Medicare fee schedule reductions, including pathology reductions that went into effect on January 1 plus the 2% Medicare sequestration reductions implemented on April 1, as well as certain commercial fee schedule changes. Consistent with the first quarter, positive test mix is essentially being offset by business mix. We've shared previously, we continue to expect that for the full year, the underlying reimbursement decline will average about 3%, with about 1% of the year-over-year impact we saw in the first half of the year expected to anniversary later in the year. And over the next several years, we continue to plan for average annual reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015. Q2 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, Clinical Trials, Healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were flat compared to the prior year. This is a sequential improvement from the first quarter performance that was down about 2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 16.9% of revenues, about 1.7% below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues. A significant portion of the lower revenue is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiative. Adjusted EPS of $1.06 was $0.09 below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues, partially offset with cost savings realized from Invigorate. As a result of the company's ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and to simplify the organization, restructuring and integration costs totaling $19 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1% and reported EPS by $0.07. Last year, in the second quarter, it included $15 million of costs associated with restructuring, integration and CEO succession, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 0.9% and reported EPS by $0.06. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.7% or 20 basis points higher than the prior year. DSOs were 48 days, up 2 days from last quarter. The increase in DSOs can be principally related to payment delays in connection with obtaining new provider numbers associated with recent acquisitions. We expect these issues to be resolved later this year. Cash from operations was $208 million in the quarter compared to $251 million in the prior year. Lower cash from operations is largely due to the increase in DSOs, which we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $47 million a year ago. During the quarter, we also repurchased 7.2 million common shares at a price of $55.92 for a total of $405 million. As expected, we deployed the proceeds received from the HemoCue disposition into share repurchases in the second quarter. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to be 1% to 2% below 2012, prior guidance was to approximate the prior year level, earnings per diluted share to be between $4.35 and $4.50 compared with prior guidance of $4.35 to $4.55, cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion compared to prior guidance that it would approximate $1 billion and capital expenditures to approximate $250 million. In considering the full year guidance in the context of the first half performance, it is important to keep in mind several factors, as we've previously indicated that comps versus the prior year will become more favorable in the second half of the year. While the number of business days, coupled with the weather effect, adversely impacted revenues in the first half of the year, those same factors are expected to contribute favorable year-over-year comparisons in the second half of the year and be essentially neutral for the full year. Underlying revenue per requisition, which was down approximately 3.3% in the first half versus the prior year, is expected to be down about 3% for the full year, with about 1% of the impact we saw in the first half to anniversary later this year. Our 3 acquisitions contributed approximately 1% to revenues in the first half of the year and we expect those acquisitions to contribute approximately 2% in the second half of the year. Our efforts to restore growth are gaining traction and we expect to see increasing progress as the year unfolds. We saw a 0.5% improvement in year-over-year underlying volumes from Q1 to Q2 and expect it to continue to improve in the second half. And lastly, as Steve mentioned, we expect to see approximately twice the benefit from Invigorate in the second half as we saw in the first half. For all these reasons, we have confidence in the expected performance improvement during the remainder of the year required to achieve our full year guidance. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan. Well, to summarize, we see 2013 as a building year as we improve operations and begin to restore growth. We are executing well on each element in our 5-point strategy. In the second half of 2013, we'll show improvements from many reasons, which we just discussed. And we continue to have confidence in executing our 5-point strategy will drive increased value for our shareholders over the long term. Now with that, we'd like to see if you have any questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have a question from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Just a few quick ones. A few quick questions, if I could. First, on the volumes. I think, Dan, you mentioned maybe 0.5% improvement from Q1 to Q2. I just wanted to make sure we understood. Is there any calendar impact there that also might have helped that trend a little bit in terms of leap day in the first quarter or the shifting of holidays and things like that?
Dan Haemmerle: There's really not a material change in the calendar. Most of the benefit that we expect to see from the differences in how we evaluate revenue days or business days comes in the back half of the year. So no real impact in the second quarter.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, good. And then as you're thinking about the ramp on sort of the core volume, as you put it, in the second half, I mean, you describe a lot, Steve, of the things you've been doing on the sales force front. Can you help us understand the visibility on some of the specifics in terms of targeted clients or targeted market share that you expect to gain or where some of that's going to come from, or do you have that sort of visibility on the ramp that you're expecting?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Absolutely. Well, Tom, let's do this. Let's walk through -- again, we'll walk through why we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. And then what are, within that discussion, our expectations for what's described as organic improvement in the second half versus the first half. So Dan, why don't you walk through a bridge, if you will, between the first half and the second half?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. And maybe the way to think about it is if we look at the second half performance and you look at our outlook for the remainder of the year, you're looking at a range plus or minus of about 2% revenue growth in the back half of the year. If you break down the components the way we're looking at it, we think about revenue per requisition. We said it was down about a little more than 3%, about 3.3% in the first half of the year. It will improve by about 1 point in the second half. So we expect to see revenue per requisition lower than the prior year by about 2.5%, okay? And that'll get us to our full year average of 3%, so about 2.5% down on revenue per requisition. We've done 3 different acquisitions. We've also got the benefit of the revenue days, as well as the weather impact that we expect to see turn favorable on the back half of the year due to Sandy in Q4 of last year. And if you put the acquisitions in those easier comps together, that's worth about 3.5%, maybe a little bit more than 3.5%. So that leaves about 1 point of growth from our underlying businesses. And as we look at it, we are building momentum in the underlying businesses, both our Diagnostic Information Services businesses through our restore growth initiatives, as well as our Diagnostic Solutions business, which is also building momentum and expected to both provide a positive contribution for the full year. So about 1 point will come from our underlying business and a combination of both Diagnostic Information Services and Diagnostic Solutions.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Great, Dan. So Tom, to answer your question, so given that as the opportunity that we really need to improve, we do have a great line of sight to what we need to get done in the second half. Let me give you a couple of examples. First of all, we are building our professional services business that I mentioned in my introductory comments, that is building momentum. There's a lot of interest in it and we will see some volume from that in the second half versus the first half, number one. Second is we have line of sight to a number of accounts, a number of programs we're working with payors that our sales force is driving. And we have confidence, given the traction we've seen in the second quarter, that will continue into the third quarter, into the fourth quarter. Dan also mentioned that we are going to see growth in the second half versus the first half from our Diagnostic Solutions business. So without giving you all the detail, we do have good line of sight on what we need to do to deliver our guidance for the full year and the second half on the top line. And then as far as the bottom line, we also believe that we have good line of sight given the current environment that I have indicated in my introductory comments to be able to deliver guidance for earnings for the year as well. So we're going to turn it back for any other questions.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Yes, that's very helpful. Just to make sure I understand the change in the revenue guidance, is that 1% growth that you're expecting from the core sort of similar to what it was before and the reduction overall just from a macro standpoint? Or is that 1% core number sort of changed in your minds as well?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, it's slightly lower, Tom. Basically, the environment we see right now is not as strong as what we thought we were going to see this year. As we entered Q2, we are actually encouraged by April numbers. As we got further into Q2, we started to see more reports back from various sources about softening in the marketplace. We saw that in ourselves in the second quarter. And so therefore, we thought it'd be prudent going forward that we take that in consideration with our full year guidance and that's reflected in what we expect to get organically out of the business. But overall, the environment is softer than we expected entering the year and we thought it appropriate at this point of the year to adjust our guidance for the top line. However, what you'll also hear in our remarks, we are moving very, very well against our cost improvement goals. We're making excellent progress with Invigorate. And so what we have also said is we will balance that off with strong contributions through Invigorate in the second half. We've also indicated in June, we are reinforcing it today, is that we expected twice as much contribution from Invigorate in the second half than we saw on the first half.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right, right. Just last question then. On cash, it sounded like some of the cash flow issues that you saw in the quarter, you expect to sort of reverse out as you get the provider numbers nailed down. You did slightly tweak. It seems like your cash flow expectation is low for the year, down a little bit, so I just wanted to make sure we could understand that.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, sure. Why don't you bring -- put Tom through what happened with DSOs and the overall cash expectations.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, and 2 comments. One, Tom, just back to the last question quickly that approximately 1%, I was giving you in that walk across is kind of a mid -- gets you to the midpoint of the range, so just a point of clarification there. And then secondly is on the DSOs. DSOs were a little bit higher, they're about 2 days higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. And with many acquisitions, you have to file for a new provider number with -- for certain payors. We're filing with certain government payers right now and we have little bit of a delay in getting some of those provider numbers for those acquisitions. So as a result, we have some claims that we're confident to get reimbursed once we get those provider numbers in and we expect that to get cleaned up in the second half.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right. Now that -- so I understood that. I was just curious. So it seemed like I think your old guidance was for about $1 billion of cash flow. Now you're sort of approaching $1 billion of cash, so maybe, it's the small nuance. But if that -- if the provider number issue reverses itself out, what's the reasoning sort of for, I guess, cash flow that's a little lower for the year?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. And so the change in the cash flow for the full year is really just reflected in bringing down the top end of our EPS range a little bit. And also as we look at cash flow and managing our balance sheet, we felt that we wanted to give clear guidance that we're going to be approaching $1 billion, the higher end of the range of approximately, probably not going to go much further north of that, but approaching $1 billion we felt more comfortable with.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just going back to the pricing decrease that we've seen. You said the underlying pricing was negative 3.2%, a lot of it due to Medicare. Just wondering if you could break out how much pressure you're seeing from the commercial payers.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. So let's walk through exactly what's going on with pricing. Again, we've provided guidance that we would expect this year about 3%. What we saw in Q2 was in line with that expectation, and Dan will bring you through exactly how this is phasing throughout the year, which is important in it. As you know, definitely, this is a mix between our Medicare and our commercial payers. And some of this does anniversary throughout the year and that's what we reflected in our second half expectations as well. So Dan, walk him through what we come up with the numbers.
Dan Haemmerle: In terms of the pricing, Kevin, there are 3 primary drivers of the reimbursement reductions. One is the Medicare cuts that we, I think, all anticipated coming into the year that included the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, as well as the ACA changes. And then thirdly, we also included in that number an estimate for sequestration. We planned for it to take place. And if you put those components together, that's worth about 5% against our Medicare book of business, okay? Our Medicare book of business is about a little bit north of $1 billion or approximately $1 billion in total. So 5% off of that number is the first element. Second element is the Anatomic Pathology cuts, again, another set of cuts from Medicare, specifically on a handful of codes, specifically 8305, which enjoyed a 52% reduction on the technical component. And then the third component is really related to the commercial contracts with commercial payers. Some of those contracts changes took place late last year and there were some contracts that showed pricing reductions January 1 of this year, okay? So as you think about it, the majority of the Medicare cuts took place on January 1 and will carry through the entire year. One element of the Medicare cuts, the sequestration cut, went into effect April 1. And then the commercial payer cuts, we have some that have started on January 1, some that started late last year and it will anniversary later in the year and will show that point of improvement for us.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. Do you expect to see -- once you annualize and anniversary the commercial pricing pressures, do you expect to see further pressure from the Managed Care payers? Or do you think we're kind of at a point where we could start to see some improvements actually?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So Kevin, what we said back last fall in our Investor Day that we expected a 1% to 2% erosion in our price related to the pricing pressure. We also have said that we expect 3% in 2013, but we're still believing that the 1% to 2% guidance for that 3-year period is a good range. That will absorb what we knew already from the government side. Also, we have less contract negotiations in 2014 than we did in 2013, and we think that estimate is still reasonable where we sit right now.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. Okay. And then going to the proposed Medicare fee schedule and the comment that they might look at repricing the clinical lab fee schedule down the road, I'm just wondering what efforts are being made in Washington to mitigate some of these potential cuts. And let's say it were to go through, Steve, what could you do internally to offset some of these pressures?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I'll continue to do what we're doing. First of all, we are working with our trade association, ACLA, proactively on this. We actually met this week on it and are meeting weekly to talk through this with CMS. And so all the leaders of ACLA are part of this effort. As we said, at least in the physician fee schedule, it will have an impact on the industry and us to a lesser extent because we have less Medicare business as a percentage of our total business than some of the other providers of our service in the marketplace. The second is we did anticipate, Kevin, that there will be further cuts. I said this in my introductory remarks. We actually assumed some further cuts in our -- 1% to 2%, just to be prudent. So we had planned for this and we, because of it, have been really putting the accelerator down on Invigorate. And what you should see and what we've talked about, we will see more in the second half, is continued progress on the efficiencies that we're getting throughout our organization. We'll see twice as much improvement for Invigorate in the second half than there was in the first half. We are feeling very comfortable with the goal to get to $600 million of run rate savings by 2014. And we're still pushing the organization to get to $1 billion at some point after 2014. So we believe that what we're hearing is something that we somewhat expected within reason. We don't know the details. We obviously want to make sure that we carefully walk through the best outcome with the industry leadership to get to the best place for us. But what we're doing about it is exactly what we have said before. We're executing our 5-point strategy and we're driving as much efficiency gain as soon as possible out of our business to be able to absorb that and deliver our expectations for 2014 and beyond. So we're working on the plan as we've shared before.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then 2 last quick questions here. Bad debt, we did see that 20 basis point increase on a year-over-year basis. Just wondering if there's anything unusual going on behind that. And then lastly, on the capital deployment, in the $300 million after tax that you'll get from ibrutinib, do you plan to allocate that equally between acquisitions and share repurchases or maybe see a dividend increase?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So Dan, let's take the -- on the bad debt question.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. On the bad debt, it's slightly higher, it's about 20 basis points higher. And with -- from one quarter to the next, 10 to 20 basis points is really in the range of normal fluctuation for our business. So we don't see it as a signal and we don't see it signaling a different trend at this point.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And as far as the proceeds from ibrutinib, we're going to continue to do what we said, that is we're going to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders and we'll continue to act on our disciplined capital deployment strategy that we have in place. And the return that we have given to our shareholders have been in the form of dividends and share repurchases and that's what we expect to do going forward. We still have some time to complete the ASR that we put in place this spring. We'll work through that, and then we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. But we're stand behind our commitment on what we said and we're standing behind our strategy of disciplined capital deployment as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So first of all, just one clarification, does the '13 guidance include the deployment of the cash from the sale of the Royalty that you announced today?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. The cash from the proceeds, we will use it at some point. Whether or not we use it for -- we will use it in one way or another, consistent with our capital deployment strategy, but we don't see it having a meaningful impact in the back half of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, okay. And then thank you very much for all the transparency and all the detailed comments on...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I'm glad you find it useful.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: It's very useful. So just one more clarification on the pricing side. So when you think about your expectations for next year and longer term for pricing to come down by negative 1% to 2%, if we factor in the proposal in the physician fee schedule, I think that accounts for about 75 basis points based on our rough estimates. So can you just help us to better understand what are your kind of like assumptions heading into the clinical fee schedule, I think that's coming out in August, for potential rate cuts?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, understood. So let's walk through this again. Our estimate last fall was 1% to 2% over a 3-year period, more in 2013, less thereafter. We assumed in that what we knew about government reimbursement. And I mentioned in my comments is that the physician fee schedule represented about 3% of our revenue in 2012. And Dan, why don't you bring through how this is going to wash through, what our assumptions are so far?
Dan Haemmerle: Yes. So as we've looked at this, Ricky, and there's a number of moving pieces to the latest proposal that we're still working our way through and we continue to work with the trade association to better understand it. But as Steve mentioned, the physician fee schedule is about 3% of our 2012 annual revenues. That number is coming down a little bit in 2013. It's probably running closer to a 2% number as the Medicare cuts on the pathology codes were implemented January 1, so that's having a drag on that number. And we also have seen that the carryover impact to some of the pathology in-sourcing that occurred late last year into this year that it brings that number down closer to a 2% zone for the 2013 percent of revenues for the physician fee schedule. So we -- as we've said, we still are evaluating it, we're trying to understand it. We have some follow-up questions on the current proposal. And when we have some more detail on that, we will share it. And with respect to the clinical lab fee schedule question, we have contemplated government pressure in the long term, 1% to 2% guidance. In terms of splitting out our projections and our thought process beyond what we've already shared, we're not planning to do that today, not prepared to do that today.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. And the other comment I'll make is the 26% that we've seen is an average. That average that we're going through to understand what the real impact will be on us. Based upon our mix, we think it will be less than that 26%. And so what you see is that 2% of our business today, something less than what was indicated as the average. If you do the math in that, you can see what the impact will be for us in 2014. As far as the clinical schedule, yes, that is more uncertain. We're proactively working with the trade association to understand the intentions of CMS, what the timeframe is, what the logic is. The mechanism that was discussed was a mechanism around technology and with technology, it makes us more efficient. And a large portion of our value chain, yes, is running a large centralized efficient laboratories, but a large percentage of our value is the beginning of that process and the end of that process. And so we still have a lot of our cost structure that wasn't necessarily affected by some of the technology that we're referring to. So we're working through this one and has more question marks associated with it. But we believe, again, based on what we know today, based upon what we already knew going into this year with the government reimbursement changes, what we just had heard, what we see in our forecast for renegotiations with commercial players that we'll still stay within that envelope of 1% to 2% over that 3-year period that we indicated earlier. So that's where we are today.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just to help us understand it, what percent of the Managed Care commercial book is tied to this Medicare book?
Dan Haemmerle: We have hundreds of Managed Care contracts, as we've said in the past, and we have very few that are tied to or float with Medicare rates.
Operator: Our next question, from Dane Leone, Macquarie.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: I guess, I'll leave it at one since the call is dragging on a bit. I think one question that really could use some vetting here is the competitive landscape. There is smaller, I guess, national lab at this point that is public that has grown rapidly, has increased its revenue base. It's centered in the Northeast, but it's expanding nationally. And it just -- when you look at the growth rates between yourself, LabCorp and the other lab, Bio-Reference, there does seem to be some underlying share shift, some share loss. And I guess the question here is, is that something you're seeing? Is there a mitigation of loss strategy that you're looking to do as the new management team here? And really, any detail about competitive offerings would be very helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Appreciate that. First of all, if you recall in our Investor Day in the fall, we've shared our expectations for the market. We think this market has grown in the past and we actually believe this market will grow going forward. Even though we have some slowdown in utilization, we do believe that the Affordable Care Act will be net positive for this industry and for us. And we do believe that this market, given what I said earlier, will grow around 4%. What I also said back in the fall is we haven't grown with the market and therefore, we have lost share and that therefore, we needed to do something about it. And one of our points of our 5-point strategy is to restore growth. And so what I shared with you in my update is what we're doing to improve our performance of getting at the market and doing a better job in the competitive sense of the marketplace. And we have 3 areas of priorities for this year. First is related to our sales force. So what we have done is reorganized our sales force. We have put in place a better sales team than before. We have trained those people, have equipped those people, have aligned those people and those people are very, very engaged on calling customers everyday. So point number one is I believe that what we have in place today is better execution going at the marketplace from a sales perspective. So that's the first point. Second is we believe that some of our competitors have done a better job of introducing innovative products to the marketplace. We have changed our organization to align around the need for us to bring our innovation to the marketplace in a smarter way and more thoughtful way. And what we've done to affect that in our reorganization is we created a clinical franchise organization. We have 7 clinical franchises, each of which have a General Manager. And the example I gave you in my script is, one example of that is in Women's Health, that an effort in Women's Health lead to our relationship with Hologic and that will position us well in the whole field of Women's Health and will allow us to introduce sometime this year, a solution around BRCA1 and BRCA2. So introduction of solutions in the marketplace that are specific to patient problems, aligned around disease and specialties is the second area of investment we are making and that we believe we will see some of that benefit in the second half. And I believe some of our competitors in this marketplace, not just the large players but some of the niche players, have done a better job in the past and we learned from that. And we actually will respond to that with our clinical franchise organization in bringing more solutions to the market. Third is this market is changing. Integrated delivery networks are stronger than ever before, where there are acquisitions of physicians. We've created a brand-new organization that we call our professional services organization. They partner with integrated delivery networks to understand what we can continue to do with many of those around referenced testing, which is the base, if you will, of our relationships -- are with those organizations. Actually, in fact, if you look at the top 100 hospitals ranked by US News & World Report, we actually do business -- reference business for about 90% of those top hospitals. And so with those strong relationships, we are very engaged in discussions around what we need to do with laboratory management relationships or what we potentially do if they want to by taking on their outreach business. And the examples of Dignity Health and UMass are great examples of that. So we're building that. So those 3 initiatives this year have been our focus. Those 3 initiatives have been our investments that we have made in this year. And we feel with our focus there, that will allow us to make progress this year. We have said going into this year that this year is a building year. We believe this is an attractive market, but we need to do much better as an organization, executing in that market. And we believe we've made excellent progress in the first half and we believe we'll see some of that in the second half, gradual improvement. Now the other side of this is we've talked a lot about operational excellence and what we're getting out of that in terms of the efficiency. Let me also say that we're focused on making sure we provide a superior customer experience to our customers everyday. So along with the efficiency gains in that program, we're also very focused on the whole value chain of what we're doing in our patient services centers, what we're doing with our responsiveness and the quality of our laboratories and what we're doing to improve our building capability. So along with the efficiencies we are getting out of that program, we also expect to get improvements in our quality and our execution around superior customer experience. So we believe we've made a very good progress in the first half. That progress will allow us to achieve what we just shared with you in the second half. We'll see some of the results in the second half from all these efforts so far. So hopefully, that provides some more clarity.
Operator: Our last question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just want to clarify on that earlier question regarding market share, should we assume that your guidance does imply a little bit share gain at the back half of the year? And if so, can you maybe quantify that in the context of the bridge that Dan went through earlier?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, not sure you could apply that. First of all, there was a question asked whether we have good line of sight on what we need to do to deliver our guidance. We believe we do. And we believe the expectation for the second half is reasonable, given what we already know about what we'll get out of acquisitions, what we'll see with our price changes and also what's going to happen with the comparison versus the prior year. So we have good line of sight. Now what we also have, Isaac, is, with this line of sight, we're going to see some of the benefits of the investments we have made in the first half with the sales force, with new solutions in the marketplace and also with our professional services business. That will get us to our guidance. When the dust settles in 2013, we'll be able to evaluate whether in fact we stayed with the market or we actually gained some share. We don't know that yet, but we're focused on executing our plan and focused on executing. And we think the guidance we provided is reasonable based upon what we know and what we're doing.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, helpful. And then as a follow-up, on your point earlier about some of the cost savings initiatives that are going on, is it fair to say that we should see sort of a sequential improvement in EBIT margins in the back half of the year, or is there sort of a seasonality out in here you want to just keep in mind?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So what we shared in June is we expect twice as much of the contribution from Invigorate than we saw in the first half. What we shared with you today is we said the realized improvement versus 2012 is $250 million. So you can go through the math and when you go through that, you'll be able to see what in fact we do expect in the second half. And Dan, would you like to add to that?
Dan Haemmerle: No, I think that's right. You've got $250 million realized in the -- it's more than $250 million realized in the current year and we expect to see twice as much savings in the back half of the year as the first half. So you can run through that, we're not giving specific EBIT or operating income percentage guidance or anything like that, but you should see some improvement in the back half of the year.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just one last cleanup here on the ibrutinib monetization. It sounded like you guys are leaning towards using the vast majority of that for a return to shareholders. Is it possible that some reasonable percentage might be used for strategic use as well?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Again, we will return the majority of the free cash flow to our shareholders. We have a disciplined capital deployment plan and strategy. We're standing behind that. We'll approach this proceed with that in mind. We believe that one way that we can continue to return the majority of free cash flow to our shareholders, it will be from our dividend and also share repurchases. But also, to your question, we are continuing to look for acquisitions that support our goal in that regard related to getting to a 1% to 2% revenue growth from acquisitions. I'm also pleased to say that we've got there in the second half. You see that we're looking year-on-year at 2% improvement in our top line related acquisitions we've done so far. We're continuing to work on those. And so therefore, there might be some portion of our capital that's used for those in the second half as well. I can't speculate on that at this point. But we're staying the course with our 5-point strategy and deliver disciplined capital deployment in the back half as we've done so far.

Now I'd like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Dan Haemmerle: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and 2013 current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. What I'd like to start with is to take you through our top line performance and then review progress against our 5-point strategy. And then Bob will provide details on the results. In January, we told you we anticipate a continued revenue softness in the first half of this year and that our efforts to restore growth would result in gradual improvement through the rest of the year. So as expected, we saw a continued revenue softness in the first quarter. Now there are a number of factors that impacted our year-over-year comparisons. As you'll hear from Bob later, after considering those factors, our underlying volume was down about 2% versus the prior year. While some of this may be driven by continued softness in healthcare utilization, we believe there is more we can do to restore growth. And I'll share details on those efforts in a few minutes. In addition, we saw revenues per requisition lower by 3.4% in the first quarter, primarily due to the combination of commercial pricing pressures and Medicare cuts. We continue to expect it to be down about 3% for the full year. Our 5-point strategy is aimed at addressing several of the fundamental factors that contributed to this quarter's softness, and we are making progress on each of these elements. Our primary focus in 2013 is on driving operational excellence and restoring growth. Well, turning first to driving operational excellence, we continued to make excellent progress with our Invigorate cost initiatives, which helped mitigate much of the bottom line impact of revenue softness. We exited 2012 with a run rate of $200 million in savings, and we are building on that momentum. In connection with our strategic goal of simplifying the organization, we have implemented a new organizational structure that will remove 3 layers of management for the business. I'm happy to report we're on track to meet our earlier commitment to reduce 400 to 600 management positions this year. It's already enabling us to be more agile, more collaborative, customer-focused, and is contributing a significant cost savings. In addition, we are building a more performance-oriented culture, which includes the creation of the new management process and performance management system. We've gone to educate all our employees on new behaviors and cultural norms, one of which is being more externally oriented, so we can focus more on our customers. We have taken a number of steps to restore growth. We've expanded our sales force and now have more sales people in place than we have ever had. We have filled virtually every management position in the new unified sales organization. We held our first-ever National Sales Meeting in February. And I can tell you the team left that meeting excited about their new assignments, their new selling tools and their new simplified compensation system that actually went into effect on April 1. We have completed the vast majority of customer transitions along with sales reps to make sure that they're more efficiently addressing their new sales territories. We have reorganized the way we approach health plan customers and are having greater engagement at all levels. And then finally, we built a new professional services organization and are seeing strong interest from integrated delivery networks throughout the country. We are executing our plan to restore growth that we shared with you in November, and as we have said, it will take some time to see improvement. The results of these efforts may not be visible in the numbers yet, but we believe we're doing all the right things to motivate, incentivize and focus the sales organization. And we continue to expect results from our efforts to gradually build throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to make strong progress on the remaining 2 points of our strategy, refocusing on Diagnostic Information Services and delivering disciplined capital deployment. We completed the previous announced sale of HemoCue and plan to redeploy the $300 million of proceeds into share repurchases during the second quarter. In addition, we completed the acquisition of the UMass outreach diagnostic services business and announced the planned acquisition of certain outreach testing operations of Dignity Health. We expect to complete additional fold-in acquisitions, consistent with our goal of delivering 1% to 2% growth per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. The Dignity transaction, combined with the UMass partnership, positions us extremely well in 2 states that are leading the way in healthcare reform and is one more indication that hospitals are indeed looking for more cost-effective ways to manage their diagnostic testing needs. We're excited about these 2 opportunities, as well as the growing number of discussions we're having with hospital systems interested in working with us. Well, since we introduced our new vision, goals and strategy at Investor Day last November, we have been driving transformational change at Quest Diagnostics. And as you know, whenever a company undergoes major change at a rapid pace, you might think there's disruptions, even significant disruptions. And knowing this, I have been personally monitoring this closely. I spent time meeting with employees, particularly with sales reps around the country, and accompanied them on many customer visits. The conversations with sales reps and employees have shown that -- them to be engaged, enthusiastic and focused. And I can share with you that I'm not seeing any evidence of disruptions. In fact, I believe we're doing a good job exiting -- or executing our way through this challenging period. I'm proud of some of the most recent accomplishments. First of all, during the quarter, we launched several significant new service offerings, which include the new dementia panel and a non-invasive prenatal genetic test. In addition, an important HIV genetic test was introduced last year, which benefited from the recent HHS guideline change. Each of these address a growing area of demand. Just this week, we welcomed Jim Davis. Jim is a veteran of GEs healthcare business, and he'll be the Senior Vice President to lead our Diagnostic Solutions business. He will oversee Diagnostic Products, our Insurer and Employer Services, Clinical Trials and Healthcare IT. And then finally, we were recognized as one of FORTUNE's World's Most Admired Companies this year and ranked first in our industry category. We see 2013 as a building year, and we will improve operations and begin to restore growth. Now let me turn it over to Bob for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.8 billion were 6.4% below the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 6.7% below the prior year. Volume was 3.4% below the prior year, with approximately 2% due to fewer business days in the quarter compared to last year and about 0.5% due to the impact of severe weather. Partially offsetting those factors was about a 1% volume contribution from the UMass acquisition, which we completed in early January. The resulting underlying volume was about 2% below the prior year and consistent with the comparable measure last quarter. This is also consistent with what we shared in January when we indicated we expect to see continued volume softness in the first half of the year, with improvement in the second half due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and building momentum on our efforts to restore growth. Revenue per requisition in Q1 was down 3.4% compared to the prior year. This compares to a year-over-year decrease of 2% reported in the fourth quarter of last year, with most of the change due to the Medicare fee schedule reduction, including pathology reductions, as well as certain commercial fee schedule changes, all of which went into effect January 1. The 3.4% decrease reported for the quarter is principally reimbursement-driven as positive test mix is essentially being offset by business mix. We continue to expect that for the full year, the reimbursement decline will average about 3%, with about 1% of the year-over-year impact we saw in the first quarter expected to anniversary later in the year. Consistent with what we shared with you in January, we continue to plan for average reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015. Q1 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were down about 2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating income, at 15.2% of revenues, was about 1.5% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to lower revenues, particularly the lower reimbursement. A significant portion of the reimbursement and volume impacts is being offset by continued progress with our Invigorate initiative. As we indicated on our last call, we exited last year with about $200 million in run rate savings compared to a 2011 baseline. We expect to achieve $600 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014, and we are on track to reach about 2/3 of that by the end of this year. Our goal remains to bring that number to $1 billion over time. Adjusted EPS of $0.89 was $0.16 below the prior year, with the decrease principally due to lower revenues, partially offset with cost savings realized from Invigorate. Restructuring and integration costs, totaling $45 million, reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.5% and reported EPS by $0.17. Last year's first quarter included $20 million of costs associated with restructuring, integration and CEO succession, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1% and reported EPS by $0.08. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues, which is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with unmet deductibles and co-pays, improved 20 basis points from the prior year to 4%. DSOs were 46 days, down 1 day from last quarter. Cash from operations was $47 million in the quarter compared to $161 million in the prior year. Cash flow in Q1 is seasonally the weakest of the year, and as we explained on our last call, in this quarter, was further impacted by about $70 million of income tax payments, which were deferred from Q4. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million common shares at an average price of $57.81, for a total of $62 million. We plan to deploy the entire $300 million in proceeds received from the HemoCue disposition into share repurchases in the second quarter. Turning to guidance. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to approximate the prior year level compared to previous guidance of 0 to 1% growth; the remaining elements of guidance are unchanged; earnings per diluted share to be between $4.35 and $4.55; cash provided by operations to approximate $1 billion; and capital expenditures to approximate $250 million. In considering the full year guidance in the context of Q1 performance, it is important to keep in mind several factors. As we've previously indicated, the comps versus the prior year will become much more favorable in the second half of the year. While the number of business days, coupled with the weather effect, adversely impacted revenue comparisons by 2.5% in the first quarter, those same factors are expected to contribute to favorable year-over-year comparisons of almost 2% in the second half of the year. Revenue per requisition, which was down 3.4% versus the prior year, is expected to be down about 3% for the full year, with about 1% of the impact we saw in the first quarter expected to anniversary later in the year. We expect the Dignity Health acquisition and other fold-in acquisitions to contribute about 1% of revenue growth in the second half of the year or about 0.5% for the full year. This is in addition to the 1% revenue contribution we expect from the UMass transaction. Lastly, on the revenue front, our efforts to restore growth are gaining traction, and we expect to see increasing progress as the year unfolds. Regarding our Invigorate program, we are solidly on track to deliver our commitment of $600 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014 and, as we saw last year, expect the amount realized this year will continue to ramp up as the year progresses. And finally, we plan to deploy the $300 million of proceeds from the HemoCue transaction into share repurchases in the second quarter. This amount is additive to our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we are actively exploring opportunities to monetize the Celera products business and drug assets, which could present an opportunity for additional share repurchases. For these reasons, we are confident in the expected performance improvement during the remainder of the year required to achieve our new full year guidance. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Bob. So what you've heard from Bob is there's a number of reasons to believe we will see improved performance as the year progresses. I'd like to add a few comments. First, I've personally seen the efforts of our commercial team, and I know the difference they're making with our customers. And because of this, it gives me confidence we will start to see signs of improvement soon. As you have heard, our guidance does contemplate additional fold-in acquisitions. And based upon discussions we are having, I'm confident that we will see additional contributions from acquisitions later this year. We are actively exploring options to monetize our Celera products and drug assets, and this could present additional flexibility for additional or incremental sales -- share repurchases. So in summary, we continue to see 2013 as a building year, and we have confidence that executing our 5-point strategy will drive increased value for our shareholders over the long term. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Amanda Murphy, William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So I had a question. You mentioned that you were seeing increased traction from the efforts on the Restore initiative. Just curious if you can provide a little more detail there in terms of specifically what you mean as it ramps through the rest of the year.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, well, thank you, Amanda. First of all, Restore has 3 priorities for this year. We've laid it out in our strategy. We have 7 platforms that we need to invest in over the long term to restore growth, but 3 specific priorities for this year: first is to bring sales excellence to the company; second is to really take advantage of our strong position in the advanced and esoteric testing and build on that this year; and then third is to really propel our belief that professional lab services could provide a new opportunity for us. And we see yet another example with Dignity this quarter that an integrated delivery network on the West Coast has agreed to sell certain assets to us in their outreach activity. But related to the first piece of Restore, which is our sales excellence, I've said in my opening comments that we did excellent progress. In the fall last year, we put together a different organizational structure. That organizational structure included consolidating our 6 sales forces into 1. We brought in a new sales leader, Everett Cunningham. Many of you met him at our Investor Day. We went through the organizational design. As I said in my introductory comments, we've filled now virtually every management position. We've made sure that every sales rep had clear accountability for their assignments going forward. We had to make some changes with customer accounts. We did that in an orderly fashion. But I can also share with you that we were very careful to make sure that if, in fact, there were some customer concerns, we, of course, corrected those at a detailed account level. And then we held our first-ever National Sales Meeting to kick all this off in February. And then in April, this April, we introduced a new simplified compensation system that went into effect. So we're off and running with a better sales force than ever before. We have more sales people than we've ever had within Quest. We have a better structure. I mentioned that I spent considerable amount of time with sales reps and with customers to see how it is going. And I can assure you, based upon my travels, I have confidence in the new structure we've put in place, the new systems we've put in place and in the new compensation system we've put in place and also the tools that we've equipped our sales force with. They're quite motivated and engaged. That's one point of restoring growth. The second is around esoteric testing and also taking advantage of our science and innovation and building on that trend we see in the industry. Another part of our organizational change is we've created a new clinical franchise organization. We've put together 7 clinical franchises. We will be managing that underneath Cathy Doherty for 6, and the 7th will be managed by Jon Cohen, 2 senior members of my management team. Cathy and Jon have made excellent progress pulling together the alignment of what's needed to really drive that science and innovation into the market in a much more aggressive way than ever before. And so we feel good about the progress on that. And then finally is to build a professional services organization to sell laboratory professional services. As you recall, we think we could leverage the strong presence we have in hospital accounts today with reference business. We believe we can bring that up and provide a whole range of services up until including the acquisition of outreach businesses. And so those 2 parts of our strategy, growing our esoteric advanced testing business, as well as our services business, will build throughout the year. And so we do believe that in the second half, we'll see some of the benefits from those investments as those programs gain some traction. And also, as I said, we really started to reorganize our sales force last fall. That's been snapped into place. New leadership is in place, sales reps are assigned, and they're off and running. So that is all to plan, and now it's all about execution, and we do expect to gradually see improvement throughout the year, as we said coming out of last year. So I don't know if there's any more questions about that.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Well, I guess as a follow-up. I know you've talked historically about, well, your historical market share trends, and obviously, you expect that to turn around through the rest of this year. So -- and I appreciate everything you just said. I guess I'm curious, have you seen anything, from a competitive standpoint, changing? So if you think about all of the enforcing that's been going on by physicians and hospitals buying back practices, and obviously, you're also buying outreach programs. And then whether it be other independent labs, have you seen anything change from that standpoint?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, Amanda, it's hard to get information that you can see there's any change yet. What I can say, it feels like the market is about what we saw in the second half of last year. That's continuing into the first quarter. As Bob said, we had a tough compare. We don't have good data on what's going on with the competition yet. And we don't see a substantial change of what's happening with what we call the hospitalization effort that's -- that has an effect -- that has had an effect on our market. So overall, we don't see a material change in the first quarter from what we think we're doing in the market. We've put in place our 3 initiatives this year to restore growth. We think we've made good progress, but it's too early to say that we've started to see the gradual improvement we've expected for. So overall, not much to comment on yet based upon our performance in the market because we just don't have the data.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I have a couple of questions here. So first of all, when we think about the outlook for second half of the year, I think we get to around 2% same-store growth -- volume growth in the second half as the sales force productivity kicks in. And Steve, you mentioned in your response to previous questions that there've been made some adjustments for the sales force compensation. So can you share with us like some of the metric that sales force is now tied to and how you think of that in contributing to the growth in the second half of the year?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Okay, sounds good. Thank you, Ricky, for the question. First of all, there's several aspects that will help us gradually improve our performance in the second half. First of all, we're talking about the sales forces gaining momentum. You asked about specific metrics. What we've put in place is a more rigorous, disciplined, structured approach, a professional approach to managing the sales force. Giving you an example, we're asking for a target level of -- or targeted number of sales calls per individual. We're rigorously managing that to the individual sales reps to make sure we're calling on our customers in a frequent way and a regular cadence. That's a new approach that we've put in place. And given our experiences, we think that's the best way to gain business and gain momentum in the second half. Second is we are starting to see the advantages of the new teams working together. One of the principles, Ricky, of our new sales organization is to put in a geographic area all the sales reps, which includes reps calling on primary care but also the specialist reps. And in my travels, I could tell you that we're starting to see the advantages. We are seeing primary care reps being called in to specific accounts by specialist reps and vice versa. They're passing leads. They're seeing opportunities. And since, as we said, 65% of physicians' networks are integrated delivery networks, more of the business and more of our relationship is at that enterprise level, so it has to be coordinated by that first-level manager. And that network of sales reps and their incentives to help each other out also will be helpful as we move throughout the year. I would also like to say it's not just the sales force that will help us in the second half. And in my earlier question, I commented that we do have 2 other aspects of our growth strategy that we believe will gain momentum in the second half, and that is around new introductions of new solutions to the marketplace. And that is something that we believe that we will continue to grow from and we believe we can accelerate the growth. And we'll see some of the progress from those efforts in the second half. And the third is the continuation of the opportunity we see with the professional services organization. That will build momentum. We'll see some volume for that in the second half that we didn't see in the first half. So those 3 are the 3 priorities for this year. We invested in those 3 priorities. We have not yet seen the benefit of those in Q1, but we will gradually see improvement as we go throughout the year. Let me turn it to Bob and see if there's anything he would like to add to explain the implied growth that we have in the back half because we're sure there's some questions about that. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Stephen, and this is what I tried to cover a little bit as we went through the guidance. And just to help people understand a little bit, I'll cover it again. But we talked about the first quarter being impacted by several things, which will either reverse or not recur as we get later in the year. Certainly, the days and the weather impact, which cost us about 2.5% in the quarter, we expect to have essentially a neutral impact for the full year. So you'll see that reversing over the back half of the year. Acquisitions, which contributed about 1% to revenues and volume in the first quarter, we're expecting to contribute about 1.5% for the full year. That's a combination of UMass, Dignity and other acquisitions that we intend to do and expect to do. That can actually even be a little more than 1.5% potentially. The revenue per requisition that was down 3.5% in the first quarter, we're expecting to be down about 3% for the full year. And again, that's as a result of roughly 1% of that year-over-year decline, is starting to anniversary in the back half of the year. And then the Diagnostic Solutions business, which we didn't talk about much but was down 2% in the first quarter, that's a business that we're expecting to have a positive -- or a group of businesses that we're expecting to have a positive contribution for the full year. So again, stronger performance there in the back half. When you look at all of that together, it implies that the underlying volume growth for the full year has got to be somewhere in the range of a little less than 1% to about 1%, and that compares to the negative 2% we saw in the first quarter. So Steve just took us through all of the reasons that we expect that underlying volume growth to improve over the course of the year, and that's how we thought about the year and piecing it together and how we get comfortable with the full year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Now that's very helpful, Bob. And just to clarify, does this guidance also include the potential buybacks that are associated with the potential monetization of the Celera assets? Or will this represent upside?
Robert A. Hagemann: Nothing specific with respect to the potential monetization of the Celera assets, although as we've said, we are actively exploring all of our options there. And that could present an additional opportunity for share repurchases beyond what we've contemplated so far.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Bob, is this your last conference call?
Robert A. Hagemann: It is, Kevin. It's my 65th and my last conference call.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Well, I want to say wish you well, and it's been great working with you, and I hope you have a good venture in your next -- best wishes is what I'm trying to say.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So I guess, first off, talking -- looking at your 3.4% pricing pressure, and you made a comment about the 1% that's going to anniversary, can you give us any more specifics? Is that going to be in Q3, or is that later in the year?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's really later in the year. Certainly, all in the back half is where it anniversaries, Kevin. And that's principally associated with the commercial pricing changes.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then you've provided some good detail in your prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you could maybe even give us some more color on the breakdown of that 3.4% pricing pressure. How much of that is attributable to commercial and that did start on January 1, as well as the Medicare pressure you're seeing?
Robert A. Hagemann: Right. And yes, as we said, coming into this year, we expected that Medicare reimbursement, exclusive of the pathology cuts, would cost us about 5% on the Medicare book of business or close to about 1% or so, almost $50 million. And then additionally, on top of that, the pathology codes are going to have a more significant impact on us than others because of the relative size of our pathology business. That, coupled with commercial price changes, is really what gets us to the 3% that we're estimating for the full year. And that's something that we feel as though we've got very good line of sight to at this point.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So if I'd kind of back into it, would you say commercial maybe pressure is 50 basis points of the 3.4% you saw?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, we didn't give out components of it, Kevin, at this point. But you can clearly -- the Medicare fee schedule changes, aside from pathology, they're easily quantifiable. It's roughly 5% on $1 billion or so in revenues. Again, the pathology cuts are going to have a relatively significant impact to us because of the relative size of the business. And then the rest, really, is the commercial pricing.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then, Steve, is there -- are there any other commercial contracts that you haven't renewed or that are up for renegotiation that we should be thinking about?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, the only one that we're in the process of renewing is CIGNA.
Unknown Executive: That's the only national.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: It's the only national. As you know, we have hundreds of contracts, but that's the one that's notable.
Robert A. Hagemann: Right. And that's fully baked into and contemplated in the guidance.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: It's in the 3% and the 1 point -- and the 1% to 2% guidance we've given past 2013.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then you made the comment about future tuck-in deals, and we've seen you guys do a few outreach acquisitions. When we think about future M&A, is that kind of along the same lines of what you're thinking, Steve, as more outreach programs? Or is there something else that strategically you want to get into?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: No, what you have seen between UMass and now Dignity are 2 good examples of more opportunities that we see to build on our focus on Diagnostic Information Services. We believe that this marketplace we'll continue to evaluate what is strategic and what's not strategic, particularly for integrated delivery networks. Again, as I said in the past, as in my prepared remarks, many hospital CEOs are considering their options, and we're actively in discussions. So you'll see more of what you have seen so far as we go forward. That's what we mean by tuck-ins and strategically aligned.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then just one last quick one. So recently, Palmetto updated pricing on a number of their Molecular Diagnostic codes. We know Molecular Diagnostics isn't huge for the company, but it seems like you're starting to see some positive news on that front. Is there anything -- any other momentum that would be positive heading into 2014 that you want to call out?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Kevin, let me give it to Dan. He's got the latest update on that.
Dan Haemmerle: Yes, on the Palmetto codes, we did see that a couple of the rates did increase for a couple of codes. It's still difficult to tell what they'll do with other codes. We are sure that a number of Medicare contractors -- or providers are providing information to the different Medicare contractors to help them understand the costs involved with performing the testing. But it's difficult to predict what they're going to do with respect to additional rates.
Operator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a couple of follow-up questions. Bob, when you talked about Invigorate, you talked about $600 million by the end of 2014. So is the right way to think about that, it's $400 million of incremental savings in 2013?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, Lisa, what we said is it's going to be a $600 million run rate as we exit 2014 with $500 million in the P&L in '14. Where we're at, at the end of last year or where we were at the end of last year was $200 million in run rate savings, with $160 million through the P&L. And for this year, as we exit 2013, we're expecting to be about 2/3 of the way to that $600 million run rate savings. So -- and this is all off of a 2011 baseline. So obviously, it's ramping up as we progress throughout the year. We feel very good about the programs that we have in place. They're all building momentum at this point, and it's an area that we have a lot of confidence in.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And do you think that they're going to be primarily back half-driven? Just looking at the way that the guidance is setting up based on what we saw on the first quarter, would you expect a lot more of that to come in the back half of the year? I know you made a lot of comments, say, around revenue, but you haven't really talked about the costs as we go throughout the year.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, certainly, it ramps up as we go through the year. But this isn't something that we don't have good line of sight to. We have very good line of sight to it. There's a lot of momentum, as I said, around each of the initiatives, which are part of the program. But clearly, just as we saw last year, where we delivered more at the end of the year as we exited the year than we had in the first quarter, we expect the same sort of ramp-up this year.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then my second question, Steve, would be for you. As we think about the Affordable Care Act and we start thinking about 2014, can you talk about the discussions that you're having with your exchange Managed Care partners? Are they looking for more restrictive networks around lab? And what do you see as the potential opportunities, as well as what do you see on the cash pay side as far as the risk goes as we think about 2014?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. Thanks, Lisa. Well, first of all, we continue to believe that the Affordable Care Act will be a net positive for us going forward. And as we all know, 2014 is an important year, where some of the new lives will start to enter the system. And we believe that when we have new lives in the system, that they're going to be what we do, and that will be net positive for this industry but also net positive for us. I could share with you that we're actively in discussions with all the health insurance companies, integrated delivery networks. Everyone's working through how they'll be engaged in this new system as we go forward. And related to that, yes, there is discussions around different networks and more closed networks. And we're actively in discussions of how we can participate in those. So the best way to describe it, Lisa, is there's a lot of activity going on right now. We do believe, again, it's net positive for us as it all sorts out. There will be more lives, that's good for us, and the exchanges will be a part of that.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When do you think you'll have more color around specific relationships? And my expectation would be that given your relationship with Aetna, if Aetna sees an increase in volume, the relationship should be fairly similar going forward under their exchange product as well. Am I thinking about that correctly?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, I mean, as you would expect, it's -- with those organizations that we have strong relationships with, we'll build on those relationships. My commentary about bringing sales excellence to Quest, we have strengthened our health plan organization. But also, what we've improved on is total engagement with health plans, starting with me. I'll share with you that I've, firstly, been engaged with many -- in many conversations with CEOs and talking through what's happening with their business and what will happen with the exchanges. So we'll build on those relationships as we go forward. And you asked about timing. As I said, this is happening this year. Hopefully, when we get into the second half, we might have a little more color on this, we can give you more transparency of what that could mean for 2014. It's still very early to provide any of that because it is happening as we speak.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And I also want to wish Bob all the best.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you, Lisa.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you, Lisa. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Gallucci, Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess just a follow-up on Lisa's first. Any color that you can give us on pricing relative to some of these products in the exchanges versus maybe whatever your commercial rates are today?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Tom, we're not expecting that pricing on the exchanges is going to be materially different than what we're seeing. In some cases, it might be a little lower. But what we've seen to-date is not materially different.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: In cases where you're saying it might be lower, is that because there is an exchange for a narrower network? Or is there some other dynamic just in terms of how this plays out?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's a combination of things, certainly. I mean, it's the type of product they're offering, it's the way they're structuring the network, et cetera.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just taking on pricing. You guys have talked a bit about just some longer-term pricing pressure, too, that 1% or 2%, I think, you mentioned a couple of times in this call and in the past.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to make sure I understood. That's just the pure price as opposed to your sort of revenue per requisition, so it's just -- it doesn't include any benefits of mix or anything else, that's the underlying pricing?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, the 1% to 2% is what we're looking at for price erosion. That's past 2013 if we've modeled out what we think will happen on the commercial side and also what we know will happen on Medicare so far, and that's what's in the number.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Tom, that is pure reimbursement or price, as you might think about it. The other dynamics that we've got, obviously, are test mix, which we'd expect will continue to be a favorable factor for us. And then the business mix always -- also factors in there.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right. And what are the lengths of the average contracts these days on the commercial side?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, they're still in the 3- to 5-year range generally. I mean, there are some that are shorter, obviously, but we're looking generally at kind of the 3- to 5-year range for some of the larger ones.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right. So when you're thinking out to '15 or so, a lot of that is already on the table relative to the commercial side of the equation?
Robert A. Hagemann: I would say we've got a reasonable visibility into some of that. But as you know, yes, every year, there's always contracts that are coming up.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right. And just 2 more questions. One, you talked a lot about the sales force and building some momentum. And a couple times, you mentioned new tools at their disposal. Is it possible to get an understanding of sort of the different types of things that might be doing?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And it sounds like you expect to gain some market share. So where do you think that market share is going to be coming from?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, sure, thanks, Tom. Well, we had a sales force that didn't have some of the contemporary tools that contemporary sales forces have today. So we've put in place a new CRM with the salesforce.com. We have a sales engagement tool called SAVO. We've put both in place. We also equipped them with contemporary devices. So we gave them each an iPad. And the reason for this is to make sure that we really take advantage of the collaboration that we need with the new environment we see going forward in health care. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're actually seeing some of this. When I've been out in the field, sales reps are seeing the advantages of being in all their different specialties and bringing in what we could do with pathology, what we could do with neurology, what we do with cardiology and taking advantage of that and also seeing the advantages of leveraging our enterprise-wide presence with integrated delivery networks. And to make all that happen, you need to have contemporary tools. So that's what we meant by that comment.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And my last question. Just, Bob, the Q2 buyback, you're using sort of the HemoCue proceeds, was all that contemplated in the original guidance, or is that sort of just a tweak given that, that deal is actually done at this point?
Robert A. Hagemann: That was contemplated in the original guidance because, as you recall, coming into the year, we already had HemoCue listed as discontinued operations and had fully committed to the disposing of that business.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I just like to give you thanks to over the last 15 or 20 years that we've worked together, Bob. Good luck with everything.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you very much, Tom. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'm just going back to the commercial pricing. Could you tell us, was that just the commercial payers following suit with Medicare, or was that more of market-driven pricing pressure?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's not necessarily a function of Medicare, Gary. These are contract negotiations that we've had over the years, things that we've done to expand access and the like, lock-in certain contracts. And as we said, we expected it coming into the year. It's pretty much consistent with what our expectations were.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: If you recall, Gary, we said 3% for the full year. And so what you saw in the first quarter is what we expected, to Bob's comment, and it will feather down as we go throughout the year, as we said.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, Steve, it sounds like you remain pretty confident in the sales effort and have given some granularity. Any challenges that you found that you maybe didn't expect?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Just as we said in our commentary, when we kicked off our restore initiative, it will take time. It's always challenging to grow the top line. It will take time to build out the momentum that we see and that we've put in place and the investments we're making. And we believe that we will get gradual improvement over time. And so it's very important that this year, we have 2 priorities: one is driving operational excellence; and the second is restoring growth. And so what you see in the first quarter is we have taken costs out of this business. We will continue to do that. We have a challenging goal to get to the $600 million run rate savings in 2014. But as you recall, we also challenged the organization. We're still working on that challenge as we want more than $600 million and sooner. And so we're working on additional savings to get us to a higher number, so we can drive that to the bottom line and build value. So in 2013, we need to deliver on those cost improvement initiatives and driving our operational excellence. And I want to make sure it's clear, we're also watching our customer service levels. We're watching the way we interact with our customers. We expect both. We expect to be more efficient, but we also expect to have a higher-quality, better-performing organization because there's a lot of different variables that go into decisions why customers do business with us. And we're not underestimating that impact on our business as well. So we're holding firm on making sure that we continue to improve our service levels, coupled with the efficiency gains. And as we make these investments and restore growth, we'll get that gradual improvement. You'll see some of that in the back half of the year, but that does take time. So if there's any challenge that I didn't foresee, I can say that I did -- we did believe it'll take some time, and it's turning out to take some time. So just reiterating that.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just a final question on guidance. You said you'd come in probably closer to the lower end of the prior revenue range at 0%. You didn't make any changes to the range on EPS. So is that all a function of being able to take and accelerate the cost savings? Or should we expect you to may be towards the lower end of the EPS than we would've priorly thought?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, why don't you tackle [ph] the question.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Gary, we didn't change the EPS guidance because we feel as though we've got good line of sight to the cost reduction efforts that we've got going on. As I said earlier, the momentum is building there. And while we did tweak the revenue guidance a little bit, it's not significant. Additionally, we feel as though we've got opportunities to deploy our cash more aggressively, and I cited some of those. So all in, we feel very comfortable keeping the EPS range where it was while still tweaking the top line a little bit.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And Bob, again, thanks for all your help over the years.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you very much, Gary.
Operator: Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo, Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, I just want to follow up with something in the comments you made in your sort of prepared remarks. I think you seem to suggest that volumes maybe in 1Q were somewhat of a continuation of maybe what you saw in the second half of last year. And I'm just kind of curious, I mean, I understand the ramp in the back half of the year and all the building blocks to kind of get there, but are you assuming any improvement in the overall market growth? And could you give us a sense for maybe where the market growth is today? I'm trying to understand if things are getting better on the Anatomic Pathology side given the reimbursement cuts or if you're still losing a little bit of share to hospitals. If you could just help me through that a little bit, that will be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Glen, thanks for the question, I appreciate that. My comment about the comparison versus the second half, actually if you look at our first quarter volumes, they were up a little bit versus what we saw in the fourth quarter. Some of that you expect because of seasonality we typically get in Q1, but they were softer versus last year, and we went through the reasons for that based upon a difficult compare, the very strong year last year. But if you look at what we're assuming in our guidance going forward, we're not looking for a material change in the overall environment in the marketplace. And if you look at our second and third and fourth quarter of last year, and we did see some softening already in those quarters, so now, as we said in our comments about the easier compare, that's factored too into our discussion or in our guidance as well about the second half. So no material change in the environment going forward. So what we saw in the first quarter and what we saw in the second half of last year is what we expect to see going forward.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe if I can just follow up, given the relationship you guys have with Aetna, obviously, the Coventry deal should be closing here shortly. I mean, have you built in sort of any increased volume assumptions based on that acquisition? Or is that not that meaningful?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, we continue to be engaged with all our partners. Aetna is one of our strong partners. We are working with them proactively. And as you would expect, we're working on that integration plan with them. We're hopeful that we could pick up some volume from that. But that's one of a number of initiatives that we're working on with Aetna, but we're doing the same with other partners as well.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe if I can finish up with one last question on the reimbursement front. I mean, the President's budget, obviously, was released last week, proposed some additional cuts to the lab industry looking at a little bit longer term. I mean, is that kind of in line with your expectations? Was that a little bit worse than your expectations? Or any thoughts around the longer-term reimbursement perspective would be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, the discussion has started so it's too early to comment on whether that's going to hold. As you can imagine, the trade association and ourselves individually, as a company, is doing our share of talking to the right people in Washington. We believe that this industry has paid. You've seen it significantly this year, we've got 3% overall price erosion, and a large portion of that is related to our government business. So there is a proposal on the table, whether that will hold up or not after all the dust settles, is unclear at this time, but we'll continue to work it as we have worked it. And the position that the industry has taken is this is an industry that adds a lot of value to health care. We argue that the majority of healthcare decisions are made with the benefits of what we do. Some people estimate that to be 70% of healthcare decisions. And 3% of the costs, we have had significant cuts so far. We also had the pathology cut this year. So we're making sure that Washington and the policymakers hear that. We will continue to do that, and we'll see what happens as time goes on.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Bob, maybe I'd tag you one last time before you leave here. But one quarter doesn't a year make, but the deal spending is doubled with more on the way, the CapEx is up year-over-year, the outstanding debt is up sequentially, it's not exactly consistent with that improving ROIC story that you're seeing in the income statement or trying to make on that income statement. So is there a commitment to reduce the capital base with $600 million in cost cuts over the next couple of years?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Bob, just a few points on that. Yes, the debt has been reduced significantly from a year ago. You saw a modest tick-up of about $40 million or so in the first quarter. That's just seasonal working capital requirements there. Yes, with respect to the deal spending, Steve's articulated that a key element of our strategy, to deliver strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions, and when we laid out the criteria for those deals, one of them was improving ROIC. So it had to be accretive to our planned ROIC. In many cases, we're looking at mid-teens ROIC within 3 years on these transactions. So we don't see these as dilutive to ROIC, we see them as accretive. And then additionally, we are looking for opportunities to refocus the business and then take the proceeds from that refocusing and deploy it back to shareholders. You've seen that with HemoCue. We have additional opportunities as it relates to the Celera drug assets and the Celera products business. So there's a real focus on improving ROIC here. And I think we've shared with you in the past that management is heavily incented as part of our long-term incentives to drive improvements in ROIC. So I think you'll see a lot of discipline there, continued discipline.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Would it be -- can you size the expected divestiture proceeds versus the expected deal spending this year? Is it possible to get some kind of idea?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, without projecting deal spending this year, certainly, the HemoCue transaction and the proceeds there will fund most, if not all, of any planned acquisitions we've got this year. And then on top of that, we've got additional opportunities for proceeds from the various Celera assets, the drug assets and the products business.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: 5x, could it be that wide, the spread between proceeds versus divestitures?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's very, very early, Bob, and it'd be very speculative at this point.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right, Bob, good luck.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: We've covered a lot of ground here, but I did want to clarify your assumptions on guidance. You guys are -- it sounds like assuming 1.5 percentage points of acquisition contribution this year, minus 3 on pricing. So if we look at the first quarter volumes that you had, it looks like your full year guidance for a 0% revenue does call pretty much for a big acceleration in the underlying volumes for the rest of the year. And even if we put in context your easy comps, can you help us get comfortable of why you would see that kind of acceleration, particularly as you reorganize the sales force?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, Bob, why don't you take it through the year to kind of -- think about the year and what that means to the back half?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and Isaac, let me, again, just take you through some of the pieces here. The comps do have a pretty significant impact in the back half of the year. That, plus the weather, impacted us by about 2.5% in the first quarter. It's going to be neutral for the full year, so that full amount anniversaries. As we said, we do expect there to be additional contributions from acquisitions. We've labeled that as about 1.5% for the full year, up from the 1% that we saw in Q1. And there's the potential for that 1.5% to be even a little higher than that. Revenue per req, we took you through portions of that, that anniversary. And I did mention earlier as well the Diagnostic Solutions business, which we expect to be a contributor to revenue growth in the back half of the year and positive for the full year as well. When you cut through all of that, clearly, it does mean that we're expecting improvement in underlying volumes. But for the full year, we're looking at something in the range of about 1 point or so in the underlying volume growth, and that compares to down 2% in the first quarter. So we are expecting a ramp-up. But for all the reasons Steve cited, we're pretty confident in that because we are seeing some building momentum there and expect to see the progress as -- mostly as we get into the second half of the year.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just my follow-up would be on the earnings side of the guidance range. The scenario that gets you to the high end of the range that you guys still have, I mean, is that going to be largely a function of accelerating Invigorate savings? Or is there an operational driver beyond that we should think about that would actually allow you to get to the high end of the range? Just trying to think about the sort of bare -- bold case scenario.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, it's accommodation of a couple of things, obviously. In any time you're doing some modeling, you always have multiple levers here. And while we're estimating that revenues are going to approximate the prior year level, that means that it could be a little bit on each side of that. And certainly, if it's to the upside of that, that contributes to positive earnings. Certainly, some of the things that we've got going on with Invigorate can give us some uplift there as well. And then potentially, anything that we might do with additional share repurchases from proceeds from divestitures could give us some upside towards the end of that range.
Operator: The next question comes from Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a couple of odds and ends here. First, as it relates to the Celera portfolio, I just want to clarify, are there other royalty or drug license assets outside of the Celera portfolio that are included in this process? I just want to try to clarify, do you expect the bulk of what you're working on there to come from the Celera piece, or are there other pieces?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Darren, when we speak about the drug assets, they are the assets that we acquired as part of the Celera transaction. Quest, prior to acquiring Celera, did really not have any assets like that. Celera had participated in the development of certain drugs: one of them, odanacatib, which is Merck's drug for osteoporosis; the other, ibrutinib, which is the drug that the joint venture of J&J and Pharmacyclics are taking through trials at this point. That's a cancer drug. It's one that, obviously, has a lot of excitement around it. But those are the 2 principal drugs that we're talking about that we have some royalty rights to.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, yes, just I wanted to confirm that there weren't any legacy things in there, so that's helpful. I guess the other question or clarification, you've given us a lot of helpful commentary on how the guidance builds, so I'm not going to revisit the volume piece, but given the sequestration hit mid-quarter, and I think your commentary was that some of the Managed Care pricing impact, about 100 basis points, anniversaries much later in the year, is it reasonable to assume that Q2 pricing is actually similar or even slightly worse than what we saw in Q1? I just want to get a sense for the progression of the pricing piece.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes. Without giving -- attempting to necessarily give quarterly guidance here, the improvement that we expect in revenue per req or reimbursement is really in the back half of the year as something start to anniversary out. Yes, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year change in Q2 to be materially different than what we saw in Q1.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And last thing is for Steve, and you talked a bit about the things you're doing to develop a professional services organization, particularly to pursue some of the hospital opportunities. Steve, I guess, could you just maybe give us some color on whether you're seeing the sales cycles for some of these hospital opportunities start to close in and just how you're looking at that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, thanks, Darren. It is building. And it is building actually faster than what I have anticipated. I've shared with you all that I've done a number of sales calls. Even last week, myself and Everett Cunningham went to visit the hospital system in New England, and they're contemplating what they do going forward with Diagnostic Information Services, and they're thinking about how they can work with us. We have that as one opportunity just as an example of -- this is happening at a very rapid pace. So that call just came in about 2 weeks ago, and we followed up on it. That's one of many examples. There's a lot of interest on what we've done so far. We're building a reputation of having a capability to do this. We wanted to use UMass and now Dignity as great examples of where we can buy an outreach business. But also we have other ways of working with integrated delivery networks. So what we can see so far, Darren, is I think our reputation is building, I think the activity level is better than I expected, and I am encouraged by it.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's great. Bob, all the best to you.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you, Darren.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor, Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Bob, good fortune to you. You've always been very patient with us analysts, so we all appreciate it, I think.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you, Gary.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a few quick numbers questions. On G&A, $295 million, I guess I was a little surprised given, I guess, both the revenue weakness and the cost-cutting initiatives that, perhaps, G&A wasn't down sequentially. So I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but can we just kind of talk around kind of the run rate of G&A on a dollar basis? Should we be expecting that to come down on a dollar basis, or are we still kind of thinking about G&A avoided as a cost save, so to speak?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, first of all, let me tell you that Bob will comment on the adjusted SG&A, and a portion of what we've mentioned that we enjoyed in the quarter is the benefits of the Invigorate. And we're pleased with the progress that we saw in Q1, and it allowed us to mitigate some of the softness that we saw from the bottom line because at the top line, some portion of that Invigorate savings does hit G&A but also hits our selling costs as well. And what you're probably looking at is the total reported numbers and there were some onetime restructuring charges in that number. So Bob, how would you like to give them a little more transparency of our progression of expenses because the trend line is good.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and Gary, the SG&A line, G&A in particular, is where we're seeing a lot of the benefits of the management delayering and the like at this point. And when you look at SG&A as a percentage of revenues, it's down almost a full point versus...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Adjusted.
Robert A. Hagemann: Adjusted from last year. And actually, on an absolute basis, it's down as well. So we can circle back to you and take you through the numbers, but both on an adjusted basis and a reported basis, it's down versus the prior year. And on an adjusted basis as a percentage of revenues, down pretty significantly.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, absolutely. [indiscernible]
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. We pulled the restructuring out of that, I just -- I was looking at it more sequentially, I definitely have it down year-over-year, but I was thinking more sequentially. My second question is when we look at the total revenue decline in the quarter, do you have a rough estimate of organic revenue decline year-over-year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, when I took you through the analysis before, the -- when I spoke to underlying volume down about 2% versus the prior year, that's -- aside from reimbursement, yes, that's what we saw as the organic volume decline.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. I was trying to think of how you thought about the total revenue number organically, but just because I think there's kind of maybe moving parts on the reimbursement side as well. But so we'll take the negative 2% organic volume and just assume that the price per session decline is essentially organic and add those 2 together.
Robert A. Hagemann: Right, that's a good way of thinking of it.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Two more quick ones. On the Dignity outreach program you acquired, can you disclose the purchase price, or will you be disclosing the purchase price?
Robert A. Hagemann: We are not disclosing that, Gary. We typically have not on some of these fold-in deals, obviously, for competitive reasons and the like.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Can you give us kind of a thought process on a multiple of revenue or pro forma EBITDA that makes sense for these outreach deals, which I assume are mostly pretty -- the bulk of which are probably routine testing?
Robert A. Hagemann: Right. In many cases, it is routine testing. Yes, as we said earlier, we had several criteria that we use in evaluating each of these fold-in acquisitions. First is it's got to create real value for our shareholders. So as we look at the purchase price that we're paying versus what we expect the value to be on a discounted cash flow basis, there's got to be a substantial value created there. Additionally, as I said earlier on the call, we want all of these to be accretive to ROIC within a reasonable timeframe. And we want them to be accretive to earnings per share within 2 years in each case as well. So with that as the discipline that we go through, you should expect that the multiples that we're paying are very market-driven. Obviously, some of these are competitive situations; others are not. But really, the real value that's created in these fold-in deals is through the cost synergies. In many cases, we see that the hospital reimbursement is higher than us, and there's actually negative revenue synergy when we reprice a lot of that. But that is more than offset by the cost synergies that we realize because in most cases, and the Dignity deal is a good example, we're not really acquiring infrastructure, we're acquiring a book of business that we're running through our existing infrastructure, and that generates very strong incremental margins for us.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. My last quick question. Cash from ops, $47 million versus $161 million. You cite the $70 million deferred tax benefit you had in the first quarter of '12. But that total tax payable line swung almost $120 million against you year-over-year. So I presume that's not recurring and normalized cash from ops, obviously, given you reiterate your guidance, normalized cash from ops was better even than, perhaps, the $47 million plus the $70 million. So is there anything in that -- anything else in that tax payable line that we should know about outside of just seasonality and typical movement?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, and I'd be a little careful because sometimes you got reclasses between the taxes payable and the deferred taxes line. The actual change in tax payments -- total tax payments in the quarter was about $74 million versus the prior year, about, yes, $84 million in total tax payments in the quarter versus about $10 million last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper, Raymond James.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes, I think actually all of my questions at this point have been answered, so I'll just echo my comments, Bob, it's been a pleasure working with you, and good luck going forward.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you very much, Sandy. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group.
Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Yes, just a follow-up on CIGNA. You mentioned, Bob, 3 to 5 years is the normal contract. Some of these larger insurers, sometimes those contracts are obviously larger or longer in length. Can you talk about whether or not you expect the CIGNA contract to be a 5-year or longer kind of contract? Is that your goal?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Anthony, we really don't comment on specific contracts.
Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, on the Invigorate program, there's $500 million that will flow through the P&L. What's going to happen with that other $100 million? Why is that different than the other $500 million?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, the $600 million is run rate as we exit 2014, and $500 million is realized in that period, 2014. So [indiscernible].
Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. So when all the cost cuts eventually come through, they will be on an ongoing run rate, but it will be after 2014 because $500 million will be realized at that point, at the end of 2014. Got you. Got you.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, I'll remind you, too, we've said our goal is actually $1 billion in cost savings over time.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So we're not stopping at the $600 million.
Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, great, great. And I'll echo the same comments. Thanks for everything, Bob, and good luck going forward.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you very much, Anthony. I appreciate it.

Dan Haemmerle: Operator, wait, can we get one more comment for Steve just to close up?
Operator: Sure. Thank you.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you very much. Well, since I think we've answered most of your questions, we don't want to finish this call without acknowledging Bob. Bob doesn't expect this, but I'm going to do it anyhow. So I know many of you have commented, but I want to make sure that we recognize the critical role that Bob has played in building this company since he joined here in 1992, so a long time. As most of you know, this will be Bob's last call. But before Bob moves on, I wanted to make sure that all of us on this call, and I want to make sure that he hears it from me, and also, you hear it from me, that on behalf of the entire organization, we want to thank you for what you've done for this company, we want to thank you for all your contributions, and we wish you well in all your future endeavors. Bob, thank you very much.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Steve. It's been a real privilege to be the CFO for this company, and it's been exciting for me to be part of what we've become. And I'm -- as I've told people before, I'm very excited about the future of this company, and I'm going to be watching it. And it's been a real pleasure, and I thank everybody on the call for their remarks as well, much appreciated.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Bob.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to share that as part of the new organization structure we announced in October, I am moving into a new role in the company, supporting our new value of creation organization. Now I'd like to introduce our new Executive Director of Investor Relations, Dan Haemmerle. Dan?
Dan Haemmerle: Thanks, Kathleen. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in 2012, we generated $1.2 billion in cash, a record for the company. For the year, we expanded operating margins by 30 basis points, we reached 17.8% and this was driven by continued strong progress in our Invigorate cost-reduction initiative. We began laying the groundwork for restoring growth. So in a few minutes, Bob will review the fourth quarter with you, but I'd like to start by giving you an update on the progress we've made to execute the 5-point business strategy we shared with you at Investor Day in November. The first element of our strategy is to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services. We conducted a thorough business review of our assets to ensure strategic alignment and began to pursue strategic options for several of them, including HemoCue and OralDNA. Last year, we sold OralDNA and last week, we announced our plan to sell HemoCue. As a result, we reported the results for these businesses as discontinued operations. The second strategic element is to drive operational excellence. I'd like to share that we are making excellent progress. We delivered annualized realized savings in 2012 of $160 million with a run rate exiting the year of approximately $200 million. This succeeded our goal entering the year for run rate savings of $150 million. We are clearly on track to achieve our revised commitment to exit 2014 with run rate savings of $600 million and realized savings of $500 million. As I've mentioned in past calls, I have been very involved in this program, which is essential to building long-term value. This program is now being managed within our newly created operations organization, but of course, I'm going to be very engaged in driving progress. The third element is to restore growth. We now have a single unified sales team under a strong collaborative leader with new regional sales leaders in place across the organization. We'll have our first ever national sales force together in 2 weeks. This is where we'll kick off the year. We'll train our sales reps and motivate them to restore growth in 2013. In addition, we are executing our 7 key growth initiatives with short-term focus on building sales excellence, growing esoteric testing and establishing a hospital professional services business. Fourth, we are simplifying our organization. When we reported our third quarter results in October, we had just launched our new organizational structure and I had identified the senior management team. Since then we have been deploying the new organization deep into the business, which includes reducing the number of management layers from 10 to 7. This is on track to be concluded in the second quarter. The fifth point of our strategy is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. In 2012, we reduced debt by $654 million. We significantly increased our dividend, repurchased 200 million of shares and announced the UMass transaction, which was completed on January 2. Our UMass Memorial relationship and planned Lab of the Future in Marlborough, Massachusetts represent a new model for delivery Diagnostic Information Services for our nation's increasingly cost pressured health care system. We have begun integrating this business into our company and the new facility is being prepared for the buildout to start in the spring. Our management team is actively engaged in this integration to ensure we deliver the value we envisioned. We're actually seeing a lot of interest in this acquisition by integrated delivery networks throughout the country. We have made progress launching to our employees in November what we are calling our new quest. We have engaged our employees in the conversation about the company's new vision, empowering better health with diagnostic insights and our 5-point strategy. I'd like to share that this has generated enthusiasm and excitement inside the company. It also has confirmed our initial view that by eliminating complexity and empowering our employees, we can be more effective and create inspiring workplace. There is a strong management commitment to driving operational excellence and restoring growth starting with me. I have been personally involved in Invigorate initiative since I arrived at Quest in May. Another top priority for me is to ensure that we focus more intensely on our customers. I've already met a variety of customers and health plans, integrated delivery networks, and large physician practices, and I look forward to meeting many more customers during 2013 with our commercial team as we progress in restoring growth. The revenue guidance we provided this morning is consistent with the commitment we shared at our Investor Day in November to grow revenues in low-single digits through 2015 beginning with slower growth in the near term and accelerating through the period. We think 2013 is a building year as we improve operations and begin to restore growth. In 2013, our focus will continue to be driving operational excellence and restoring growth. We will build on the positive momentum of our 2012 Invigorate performance in 2013. We expect results from our efforts to restore growth to gradually build throughout 2013 and anticipate continued revenue softness in the first half with improvement thereafter. Our efforts to drive sales excellence, grow esoteric testing, and build the hospital professional services business will gain momentum throughout the year. This, coupled with more favorable year-over-year comparisons in the back half of 2013, is what we expect to lead to improvement in the second half. We believe the Affordable Care Act will provide volume lift in 2014 as more people gain access to health insurance. The Diagnostic Information Services industry continues to deliver significant value to health care, given it represents a large portion of the information that is used every day to make health care decisions, while it only represents a small portion of the health care dollar. In the future, with the evolving health care system that will place more emphasis on evidence-based decision-making, we believe this industry and specifically, our company, is very well positioned. Despite this long-term view, we are clearly planning for reimbursement pressure, averaging 1% to 2% through 2015. In the short term, we are projecting that the combination of commercial pricing pressures, coupled with Medicare cuts, including the most recent pathology service reimbursement reduction, will approximate a 3% reimbursement decline in 2013. We expect to be able to achieve double-digit earnings per share growth by the time we get to 2014 with that growth contributed by not only improvements at our operating earnings, but continued share repurchases as well. Our management team and I are focused on driving improvements and return on invested capital. We expect that executing our strategy will result in value for our shareholders by driving return on invested capital or long term in restoring growth. Now I'd like to turn over to Bob for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Steve. I'll start by trying to simplify some of the analysis of the results. Given the movement of HemoCue and OralDNA, the discontinued operations, explaining the performance for Q4 and full year 2012 has become more complex. To assist in understanding the impact of that change, we have presented a series of tables and Footnote 4 to the earnings release, which reconcile the reported results for what is now continuing operations to pro forma results from continuing operations on an adjusted basis had we not treated HemoCue and OralDNA as discontinued operations. Those pro forma results are comparable with how we had been reporting through the first 3 quarters and how we presented our financial guidance provided in October. The tables presented cover Q4 and full year performance for 2012. As the pro forma results show, we fell short of our full year revenue guidance by about 50 basis points. About half of the shortfall is due to the estimated impact of Hurricane Sandy with the other half, softer volume performance than we expected in the underlying business. Despite the softer top line performance, the full year pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.47, which was reduced by an estimated $0.06 for Hurricane Sandy, was within our EPS guidance range. Our success in driving our Invigorate initiative was a key contributor to delivering the EPS performance. For the balance of the discussion, I will speak to principally the adjusted results, which present HemaCue and OralDNA as discontinued operations and is consistent with how we will report going forward. In discussing the results, I'll refer to Diagnostic Information Services or DIS, and Diagnostic Solutions or DS. DIS is made up of the same businesses we've previously called clinical testing and was essentially unaffected by the movement of HemaCue and OralDNA into discontinued operations. What we previously called our nonclinical testing businesses will now be referred to as DS. HemaCue was previously included in nonclinical testing. Starting with revenues. Q4 consolidated revenues of $1.8 billion reflect a decrease of 4% from the prior year with an estimated 1.2% of the decrease due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Our DIS revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 4.4% below the prior year with 1.3% of the decrease due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Volume was 2.4% below the prior year with 1% due to the hurricane. Revenue per acquisition was 2% below the prior year level, but essentially unchanged from Q3. Favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per acquisition continued to have positive impacts, but have been more than offset by reimbursement pressures and business impairment exchanges. Q4 revenues in our DS businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, were comparable to the prior year. Q4 adjusted operating income at 17% was 90 basis points below the prior year with the decrease due principally to the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Adjusted EPS of $1.01 was $0.19 below the prior year with each of the following contributing approximately 1/3 of the decline, Sandy, underlying revenue softness and the year-over-year impact of nonrecurring tax items. Restructuring and integration costs totaling $36 million reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.1% and reported EPS by $0.14. Last year's fourth quarter included $11 million of costs associated with CEO succession and restructuring and integration, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by about 60 basis points and reported EPS by $0.04. The response to the softer volume we have seen in the most recent quarters, we have taken action to accelerate savings associated with our Invigorate program. We estimate that Invigorate delivered approximately $160 million in realized savings in 2012 with a run rate savings as we exited the year at about $200 million. This represents about 1/3 of our updated goal of $600 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014. In addition, as you heard at our November Investor Day, we are evaluating additional opportunities, which can bring that amount to $1 billion over time. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved 10 basis points from the prior year to 3.4% in the quarter. DSOs were 47 days, up 1 day from last quarter. Cash from operations was $380 million in the quarter compared to $338 million in the prior year. Cash flow in the quarter benefited by a deferral of just over $90 million of income tax payments into the first quarter of 2013. The tax deferral was offered to companies headquartered in states most affected by Hurricane Sandy. While this deferral helped cash flows in 2012, it will reduce cash flows in 2013 with the year-over-year impact being approximately $180 million. This deferral, plus the roughly $72 million of cash flow benefit we've realized from cashing out certain interest rate swaps in 2012, will adversely impact the comparison of 2013 cash flow to that of 2012 by a total of roughly $250 million. Capital expenditures were $60 million in the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. During the quarter, we've repurchased 869,000 common shares at an average price of $57.55 for a total of $15 million, bringing the annual total to $200 million. We also reduced outstanding debt by $147 million in the quarter, bringing the full year total to $654 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million. Turning to 2013 guidance. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenue growth of between 0% and 1%; earnings per diluted share to be between $4.35 and $4.55; cash provided by operations to approximate $1 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $250 million with the increase from the prior year primarily associated with our Invigorate initiative. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Bob. So in closing this quarter, we had aggressively drove operational excellence and delivered strong Invigorate savings. We are actively working to regain market share and grow our business. We have taken tangible actions to increase shareholder returns and improve return on invested capital. Now I'd be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tom Galluci, Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess, first, I was just wondering within the guidance, Bob, what do you have assumed for buybacks and the incremental portion of cost savings?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Tom, we don't provide specific guidance on buybacks, but what you can assume is that we are going to meet our commitment of returning the majority of free cash flow to shareholders through, obviously, the increase in the dividend and the remainder through share repurchases. And that share repurchases this year should be higher than they were in 2012 with our delevering behind us. We feel as though we've got much more flexibility now to return cash to shareholders. The other part of the question was with respect to the Invigorate savings. While, again, we're not giving specific guidance in terms of what that will be each quarter, at the end of this past year, we had realized about 1/3 of the $600 million in run rate savings we expect. Yes, you should expect that we're going to be in the range of about 2/3 of that as we exit 2013.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then final one. Just on volumes, what do you peg the market growth as and obviously, it would seem that you're maybe losing a little bit of shares. So could you just give us a little bit more color on some of the headwinds that you're seeing? And you mentioned before expecting sales improvement as you go through 2013. Besides the easy comps, tell us what you're doing there and what sort of visibility you have on improving that volume and market share?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, I appreciate that. So first of all, what we shared at Investor Day is we believe retrospectively is this market has been growing around 4%. Now that is a discussion around where the volume is going and some of the volume being picked up by hospitals and their outreach activities and they're picking up volume, but also picking up value share in the marketplace. But we have been not growing at that market rate, so what we have said is we've lost share and therefore, what we're doing with restore growth is to start by improving our performance and growing the business and getting back to growing with the marketplace. With that said, what we saw on the fourth quarter is continued sluggish market conditions. We did not see an improvement in volumes and actually, independent of Sandy, it continued throughout the quarter as we saw in Q3 as well. So we don't see a big change in that so far. Prospectively, we believe this is a good market. Again, we say the market will grow at 4% going forward. We believe there will be a pickup in the market size in 2014 with the Affordable Care Act kicking in. But in the short run, given what we saw in Q3 and Q4, we are anticipating that will gradually improve going into next year, but we don't see significant changes in the market going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: In the prepared remarks, you talked about guidance being back-end loaded. Can you give us some sense as to what percent of revenue in earnings will be first half versus second half?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start, and I'll turn it to Bob as well. And we shared why do we believe it's going to be back-end loaded. Well, first of all, is we do have a number of programs that we have initiated in 2012 that are gaining momentum, and we believe we'll have the most material impact 2013 in the second half. For instance, we are putting an emphasis on growing our hospital professional services business. We believe there will be volumes in the second half that we won't see in the first half. In addition to that, if you look at the comparisons versus last year, the first quarter of last year was strong. It's a tough compare. A matter of fact, there's 1% fewer workdays in the first quarter versus last year. Second is if you look at second half, we're coming off the second half that was softer. So it's a combination of our organic investments materializing in 2013 and also how the year lays out in 2013. So I'll turn it to Bob.
Robert A. Hagemann: And, Ricky, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, obviously, we wanted to provide this level of understanding so that folks as they're thinking about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, but you can get it right. As Steve said, the first quarter last year was a very strong quarter, clearly the strongest volume that we've reported. So that's going to be one of our toughest comps as we go into next year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And should we think about pricing at the same way, because I think pricing was fairly strong in the first quarter '12. So is it a fair assumption that in 1Q '13, your -- the metric that you report on pricing kind of that the price declines in 1Q '13 would be greater than what you reported in the fourth quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, again, remember last year's first quarter had the benefit in it of the -- I'll call it the last quarter of both Athena and Celera in there, which drove mix. That anniversary-ed as we got into the second quarter, and we saw relative stability in the revenue correct throughout the year subsequent to that. As we think about the 3% reimbursement pressure, it will be relatively even throughout the year we're expecting.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly on the hospital front, I mean, obviously, I think hospital outsourcing trend is one of the key debates in the lab space. And looking at the metric that you provided by payer, I see that actually hospital and reference lab revenues have gone up in 2012. So can you just give us some color on what drove the year-over-year growth in revenue from that kind of like payer bucket and how do you think about that segment in '13?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So, thanks for the question. Yes, you're right. We did see growth in our hospital reference business and we're encouraged by that. I think it speaks volumes. We shared in our Investor Day that we have bought 50% of hospital contracts with us for their reference work and given that large share, what they give to us is the more esoteric testing. We see it's a trend that will continue, but also we're going to build on those relationships in more strategic discussion about where they're heading with their laboratory activities, including their reference testing, but also how we can have more value-added services provided to them after including taking on their outreach business. So that's our strategy, but we're going to build on that trend that you picked up in the details.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Steve, your comments on the Affordable Care Act having a lift on volume in 2014, I was wondering what's your thoughts on what the impact on revenues will be with the Affordable Care Act in 2014.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, first of all, we're not going to provide guidance on 2014, but we do see -- we do believe that there will be a pickup in the market and therefore we should be seeing a piece of that market. More helpful, Kevin, given what we're doing with restoring growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see 2013 as a year to get a lot of things working and a lot of things in place to be able to take advantage of that change in the marketplace. So we're not going to provide guidance on 2014, but we should see a pickup in the market and we should be in a very good place at that point to take advantage of it.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I absolutely agree with you, Steve. I was just thinking that with the patient testing bucket going down with -- if you were uninsured that, that would have a negative impact on the revenue partially offset by the pickup in volume that you see. Plus, then you had the impact of the exchanges coming into play, which still kind of remains a question mark. Do you think that logic is correct?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, as you pointed out, there's so many unknowns right now, and that's part of the challenge is, there's no question, there's going to be more volume. Question is what's going to be the insurance product for those volumes and how will we engage? States are still deciding what their plans are going to be. So there's a lot of moving pieces of this as it unfolds as you know. So we believe, as we said in the past, is the Affordable Care Act will be a net positive for this industry and for us. We think we'll be in much better place to take advantage of it in 2014 than we were in 2012 with all the work we're doing. So we'll be actively engaged in the marketplace and stay close to it and take advantage of whatever way it shapes out.
Robert A. Hagemann: And, Kevin, I would just add to that while patient pay is our highest reimbursement, it also carries our highest level of bad debt and contributes about half of our bad debt overall. So as we see shifting out of that bucket, we should see some benefit on the bad debt side also.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Sure, that makes sense. And then I'm not sure if you guys have provided much detail behind the UMass deal, but I was just wondering what's embedded in your guidance for any volume pickup that you'll see from that relationship.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, do you want to handle it?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Kevin, as we said when we announced that deal we expect it to contribute about 1% to revenues this year in 2013 and expect it to be accretive starting in 2014.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And is that all volume, Bob? Or is there some price growth that will come in from that deal?
Robert A. Hagemann: The majority of it is volume. That's the way we should think about it.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, kind of more big picture, Steve, with the hospitals taking some share as they have made more acquisitions of physician practices, just wondering have your efforts picked up with any of the managed-care companies or with the industry to try to shift some of that volume out of the hospitals and outreach programs to lower cost settings such as yourself.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So the answer to your question is yes, it is picking up. As we have said in the fall and it continues to be growing trend, we're having more and more conversations about what will happen in the future and how hospital systems, as they, by physicians will work with us. We talked earlier in this call about reference testing. We talked about more value-added services. Our engagement with integrated delivery networks and they're thinking through how they'll work with us going forward has increased considerably from prior year. So the trying continues.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dane Leone, Macquarie Capital.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Two quick questions for me. One, what is actual cash balance that you need to have on your balance sheet?
Robert A. Hagemann: Dane, it's probably in the range of $100 million or so. The reason that you see the cash balance as high as you do at year end, which is close to $300 million, refers to the 2 things. One, the deferral and the tax payment from Q4 to Q1. So we have cash on hand to handle that $90 million tax payment. And in addition, the cash balance that we had at year end was there to cover the payment on January 2 that we made to conclude the UMass transaction.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Right. So just as a rule of thumb in a normal environment, anything above $100 million could be considered a cash sweep back to either debt paydowns or share repurchases for the down payments?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, if you look historically at our cash balance, it's probably ranged between $100 million and $150 million or so.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay, great. And the second question for me. Is there anything besides the UMass deal that's embedded in revenue growth expectations for 2013, potentially deals not done that are considered?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: So our guidance includes UMass and also includes anything else we might have in the year. As we shared, as part of our strategy, we do believe this is an opportunity to continue to look at fold-in acquisitions. And as you would expect, as we deploy our strategy, we're looking at those, and so we have an active funnel. So the guidance includes those as well.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay, great. So to not pin you down to be too specific about quarterly guidance, is there an expectation for organic volume trends to turn positive in 2013?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: The answer to the question is yes. If you go through the math, we do have headwinds with the 3% we have shared. That price pressure, we have to offset with our cost-improvement programs. And fortunately, we're in good shape. We exit the year at a nice momentum that will carry into 2013. With that said, if you go through the math, we are anticipating organic improvement and some of that, our quick organic improvement, will come from all the activities you've heard about with restore, what we're doing around bringing sales excellence to the company, making sure that we continue to capitalize on esoteric testing and building out our hospital's professional services. So we are planning on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Steve, I was wondering if you had any thoughts around potential copay on the Medicare side, obviously, still trying to work through the fiscal cliff. But as we think about that, is that contemplated in your reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so first of all, the work is going to happen to understand what will happen around sequestration. And also, we are planning for that at our 3% reimbursement cuts that we plan on for this year. As far as copay, clearly, this is going to be a discussion. It's hard to understand what might happen eventually. So it's not necessarily, in a detailed way, part of our guidance, but we'll be working through this and along with many others lobbying found that might fold out to the lab industry, but not quite clear yet.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Lisa, if a copay were to go into place, it would not necessarily show up as reimbursement deal. In all likelihood, if there was any negative impact from it, you'd see it in higher cost of collections. You'd also potentially see it on the bad debt side a little bit as we have to chase those copays. So we're not convinced that copays make a lot of sense. They shift cost to the patient, as well as add cost to the health care system, with now having to collect it.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: At least round that off, Lisa, because you asked about 1% to 2%. So 1% to 2% is our best estimate of what reimbursement pressure will be in 2015. Obviously, we have more of that in 2013, but the 1% to 2% assumes a mix of all reimbursement pressures, and so if there's something coming, that's in the number.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then Steve, you talked about interest by IDNs in the UMass deal. As many of these IDNs are becoming accountable care organizations, are you having discussions with them about becoming the outsource lab. I mean, they'll be accountable for those costs rather than fee for service before it made sense for them to run their own lab? Are those the type of discussions that you're having?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, it's both. First of all, this is a fee-for-service industry, and it will take time to move over to the accountable care model. As we've said in the past, and when you see one ACO, you see one ACO. The payments reform that's necessary to change how you think about cost and how we contribute to that is still evolving. So we have both discussions, one in today's world but also thinking about the future. So inform these relationships, they're thinking about us in the short run as well as the long run, and how this might play out, so -- but in the short run, people are thinking about today in the 2013, it is a fee-for-service world.
Operator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice, UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe just a couple of quick questions. First of all, your guidance range is not particularly wide range, $4.35 to $4.55 in EPS. But I wondered if I might get you to comment on the variables that you see most relevant in thinking about whether you'll end up at the high end of that guidance range or the low end of that guidance race? Any comment on that, by any chance?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, do you want to...
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, A.J., it's clearly volume. Yes, that's one of the biggest drivers we feel is so [ph]. We've got very good line of sight as to the cost savings that are going to come through from the Invigorate initiative. We feel as though we've really nailed down what the reimbursement pressures are going to be this year. So clearly, the biggest variable in my mind is where volume ends up.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And when you think about the savings falling through and 2/3 of the savings being realized by 2013, obviously, a portion of the savings is just offsetting the top line headwinds that you're referencing in the business, and then a portion over time is hopefully driving some margin improvement. Can you give us flavor for the prospects for Invigorate to drive margin improvement short and maybe long term?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, clearly, in the short-term, what it's been doing is allowing us to preserve margins given the reimbursement pressures that we see, and that's certainly going to be the case in 2013 as well. You can imply from the guidance that the operating margins aren't going to be significantly different than they were this year. And to Steve's point, in 2014, when we start to see some uplift in the volumes, we expect that we can then enjoy very nice incremental returns on those volumes, given what we'll have done to the cost structure at that point.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And I wonder if I could just add to that. What we've said is that we have committed that we're going to have run rate savings of $600 million in 2014, realized $500 million. But what we've also said is that we have challenged organizations to give us more. And Bob, in his remarks, said that we've actually challenged the organization that eventually, like have $1 billion in our run rate. So we're doing everything we can to accelerate what we've committed to and also bring in some more. So I'll just leave that as a commentary related to the opportunity there.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, maybe a specific question on the -- you've been asked before about the Celera royalty portfolio, and any thoughts about unlocking some value there? Any update on that thought?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. I'll start it and turn it to Bob. First of all, it is not a destruction, operationally, it is a financial asset. There is some uncertainty around the value. We're thinking about it carefully, and we want to make sure we do the right thing for all shareholders at the right time at the right place to take advantage of that opportunity. So Bob, would you like to add to it?
Robert A. Hagemann: Just that we are evaluating all of the possible options that we've got for those assets. And clearly, we intend to do what's in the best long-term interest of shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First of all, just on flu. I don't think the question was asked, so just wondering, that did come a little early this year, has been significant. And I know it's hard to tease out exactly how it impacts the entirety of the testing business, but could you comment on maybe how you would weight the impact between fourth quarter and what you're seeing year-to-date in January?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob's just getting over the flu, as you can probably tell from his voice. So Bob, you answer the question.
Robert A. Hagemann: And I didn't generate any incremental volume [ph]. But -- no, I think flu visits to the doctor's office do not necessarily generate a lot of incremental volume for us, and where there is some, it tends to be pretty low-priced volumes. So yes, I wouldn't look for any material uptick in the numbers as a result of the flu season.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. Okay. And then maybe, Steve, as part of your 5-point plan, you guys have talked about the trailing look on organic growth and the end markets you serve. And then some of the opportunities you have to regain share. But just wondering if you could give us some color as to when you think the market will sort of revisit a pace of growth that's consistent with past years, and sort of how you think that'll map against your own performance? Is that saying that you're looking at on a 12- or 18-month horizon any longer?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so what we have said is that we don't think significant -- we're not planning on significant changes in the marketplace in 2013, and that's our assumption in the guidance. The second is we do expect that there will be a pickup in 2014 with the lives entering the system with the Affordable Care Act. And so what we said earlier is we are planning on some organic improvement in 2013 to offset the price pressure. And we have a number of initiatives and programs that we started in 2012. So we do have momentum coming out of the blocks in 2013 that will pick up momentum throughout the year, and that's why we've said that we'll gradually improve throughout the year and better performance in the second half than in the first half. And then as we enter '14, we believe that we'll be in much better shape than we were in 2012 and be able to hit 2014 with a better organization, a better delivery model and a better way to capitalize all the opportunity we see in the industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from Amanda Murphy, William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I have a follow-up question on the hospital professional services business that you're moving into or, I guess, more into. Could you just help us understand how the economics of those contracts might work? So just thinking about pricing and margin relative to the base business.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, first of all, what we've shared is this is a professional services business with a set of capabilities that we will offer to health care systems through a whole continuum. First of all, the basics that we talked about earlier, there's a large portion of hospitals, about 50% that we currently provide reference testing to today, so we already have a relationship. And then if you go all the way to a full outsource, where we purchase then outreach activity like UMass is the end of the spectrum. So in that continuum, there are services that will look at running labs or providing consultancy services, if you will, for labs. And as we start to build the business, it's a combination of reference work, as well as total outsource. Bob, would you like to add some comments about the margins for it and pricing of it?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, just a point on that. And we mentioned this at Investor Day as well that to degree that some of that growth is coming from outsourcing us i.e. Managing laboratories for hospitals, that does tend to be lower margin business, but given the fact that there's very little capital investment required to do that for us, tends to be high-incremental returns on invested capital. As we said, that's one of our goals is to drive returns on invested capital, because we believe it'll drive value for shareholders. And as you noticed, we've gotten away from giving guidance around operating income percentage, because, again, it's not necessarily about the percentage, it's about the top line growth and the profits that it can deliver.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So this involves then incrementally more TC-type business, TC-only. And just what are your thoughts on that general model, the TC-PC split?
Robert A. Hagemann: It certainly could involve doing more technical work, but on the AP side. So as we're talking about hospital outsourcing, it's much broader than AP.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Some pieces of the services that we'll offer some portion of their services to us in the short run as we build that client base.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then just on the reimbursement side. Obviously, you talked a lot about that, and the Medicare reimbursement pressures presence are well known. I'm just curious on the commercial side. Have you seen -- I mean, is something that's changed in terms of how the commercial payors are viewing the lab business, or how we they're negotiating the contract at this point relative last year?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, well, in the 3% is Medicare. Also, we included in there the large pathology cut that we have received, and we'll be taking this year. And then third is we do have some reasonable commercial pricing changes, but I will not say in the 3% that we're planning, or do we see a substantial change in our relationships in pricing in the industry. Bob, would you like to add to that?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, there is nothing unique happening in 2012 on the commercial side that wasn't anticipated. Yes, this is fully consistent with what we had expected coming into the year. And as we've been talking through 2012 about reimbursement pressure, yes, that was clearly one of the reasons that we felt as though we had to up the ante on the Invigorate initiative, so that we can mitigate that, which was what the point is.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Just to give some color on the 3%, the Medicare piece, we do have a large pathology business. So it has more significant impact to us than maybe some of the other players in the industry. So that is in the number.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And so your point is on the commercial side, it's really just a couple of contracts there. If there's anything in there, it's from a couple of contracts versus the broader change?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, I wouldn't say that just a couple of contracts. Again, we've spoken about the reimbursement pressure, generally. I think that exists with just about all of the payers. And I wouldn't point to any 1 or 2 contracts that are driving what we expect in 2015.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: The big hits this year are Medicare and the pathology services cut.
Operator: Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess, we just want to get a little bit more flavor, Steve, on the 3%. And to the extent, you can just help us to think about just a little more. How does that split out between Medicare pressure and some of the commercial or managed care reimbursement pressures that you see in your book of business?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, well, 3 pieces. First of all, Medicare, second is the pathology services piece of that and the third is commercial pricing. When we provided visibility in the past in the size of Medicare cut, roughly 5%, there's a significant cut on pathology services, and that is significant for us because of the size of our pathology practice and the rest is commercial. Bob, would you like to provide a little more color to that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and Darren, as you know, we've disclosed that our Medicare revenues are in the range of $1 billion or so, so the 5% cut on that is $50 million that drops right down to the bottom line. As Steve pointed out, while we haven't provided guidance or specific information relative to the CPT codes on the pathology side that are facing the biggest cuts. It is a sizable piece of our business, and some of those codes are facing reimbursement cuts in excess of 50%. So those are big drivers that we have this year that we haven't had in the past.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And if I could just -- as it relates to the molecular diagnostics coding changes, do you have at this point any visibility in terms of what the max MACs [ph] are paying you. And are they paying you a different rate in calendar year '13 based on these molecular diagnostic codes that were set for change?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, it's still very early. We haven't yet seen the reimbursement come through on many of those codes. We're working with the Medicare into mediaries as well as in the commercial plans to try and mitigate any impact that would be there. We're helping them try and crosswalk where they can, provided additional information. And our hope is to mitigate as much as possible an impact that might be there. But again, rates are not yet published, and we've not yet seen reimbursement on those.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. And just so I'm clear about your managed care commentary that you're dialing this 3%. Is that based on your outlook for perspective contract negotiations that will be happening this year? Or are you assuming that private payers will follow Medicare to some extent on some of the Medicare reimbursement changes that you've talked about here in the past and the fee schedule?
Robert A. Hagemann: As we've said, the 3% reimbursement's a combination of multiple things. It's -- the Medicare fee cuts, the AP, CPT code fee cuts, as well as commercial. Obviously, commercial rates can be influenced by Medicare rates. We don't have contracts -- many contracts that necessarily float with Medicare, but it is a reference point in all of our discussions around pricing. But at this point, what we've baked into that 3% is -- what we fully anticipate have good visibility to at this point.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and then just last thing for me here. I wanted to just clarify, Bob, what you said about the cash flow guidance. I understand that the tax payment, just in terms of the year-over-year cash from operations, being lower in the outlook. Can you maybe just remind be what you said? And how much in terms of restructuring cash costs are also built into that guidance on a year-over-year business?
Robert A. Hagemann: Sure. Two things that you have to look at in comparing the year-over-year cash flow guidance. One has to do with the deferral of a tax payment this past quarter into the first quarter of 2013 that was roughly a $90 million deferral. So it has $180 million year-over-year impact. And that is, you'll recall, in the third quarter of 2012, we unwound some interest rate swaps that we had that generated about $72 million in cash flow for us that we're not expecting to have next year. So those 2 factors combined created about a $250 million impact year-over-year. In terms of restructuring costs and the like, well, we haven't provided guidance on that. The cash impact of restructuring cost is probably not going to be significantly different than it was this past year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Steve or Bob, have you indicated -- any idea what kind of proceeds you'd get from the 2 divestitures that you have announced in? Should we expect significantly more activity going forward? Or are we near the end of the pipeline there?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Bob, we've not given any guidance on that. I will tell you though that the OralDNA sale that did close very modest proceeds from that. And, obviously, since we are in discussions around HemoCue right now, we're not providing any estimate as to what the estimated proceeds might be there. What you also heard us say at Investor Day though is we were evaluating the entire portfolio, that includes the other products businesses, the Celera products businesses. And as we referenced earlier on this call, we are evaluating all of our options for the Celera drug assets as well.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. But you wrote a fairly sizable check for HemoCue a few years back, are we getting half of that back. I mean is it a total wash? Or how do we think about that relative to what the premium paid at the time was?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Bob, as you did see, we recorded a charge in discontinued operations. So clearly, we're not expecting proceeds from those businesses, which will match what we paid up for them. But again, at this point, I don't think it would do any of us here a service by speculating what we might get at this point.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And did you mention the CapEx number's higher this year? What exactly are we spending on this year that wasn't in the numbers last year? .
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Bob, there's 2 things, principally, that are driving the increase. The first and the biggest component is the spending relative to Invigorate, which we expect to ramp up as we start to now rationalize and optimize the footprint, look more at automation opportunities, et cetera. That is ramping up this year end. And in addition, in connection with the UMass transaction, we are building out the facility that we're going to move into. And that's adding some additional expenditures. Those are the 2 principal drivers.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And would you answer the guess [ph], obviously, '14, '15, but the number should trend down from a peak level in '13 or no?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, what we said at Investor Day's for the next several years we expect that CapEx will probably be about 1% of revenues higher than it has historically run, and we expect that to be the case for the next couple of years or so.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: I just like to add, as we continue to get some refinement on our Invigorate program, we shared in the past there's a number of initiatives that were taking cost out of the operation from, but the longer-term structural improvement will require investment in the future. We haven't exactly sized that, so we want to make sure that it's clear that we will continue to invest in the business to make sure that this is a stronger business. And as we push to get more in from our Invigorate program, strive for that $1 billion goal, it will require some investments in our facilities and also our IT systems, and that's what we're trying to size. When we get visibility of it, we'll provide it to you.
Operator: The next question comes from Glen Santangelo, Credit Suisse.
Jeffrey Bailin: This is Jeff in for Glen this morning. Just one question for you on the anatomic pathology in sourcing trend. What are you guys seeing in respect to this? And do you think that the pathology cuts could actually ultimately maybe help shift some of those volumes back to independent laboratories like yourself?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Well, first of all, it's early, so the market is digesting the cuts, clearly, as a significant cut for that service. It's on the technical side. So you put the typical side together with the professional side, it's not big as a cup, but it's a material change for that portion of the marketplace. So we're watching. We're not sure how it's going to pan out, but you can't ignore it. So we're anxious to see how it will wash through, given we are a significant player, and that there will be some change happening in the marketplace, so we're keeping our eyes on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group.
Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but if we can talk just a little bit about what particular parts of your business right now you feel are stronger? What particular testing categories are stronger? If you want to talk a little bit more about your genomic esoteric goals in terms of percent of your business going forward?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure. Well, I'll start and pass it to Bob. We talked about the hospital fees having growth, so we're encouraged by that. Second is -- so we continue to focus on a more sophisticated esoteric testing. We continue to be encouraged by the growth there. Third is that we continue to see some specialized areas of that we're in. Prescription drug monitoring continue to grow nicely. And as we go forward, what you have seen from us in terms of organizational structure, we will put more emphasis on our new organization to commercialize all the science and innovation and capabilities in this company, which I believe has not been properly utilized. So you'll see more specific areas of testing and solutions around that testing, which we believe will help us restore growth. Bob, would you like to add to that?
Robert A. Hagemann: And as -- Yes, we've shared with you already too, but yes, we are organizing around certain franchises, disease states. You might think of them as your neurology infections disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease, women's health, general health. And we believe that we'll be able to drive growth in each of those. A lot of it will be in the esoteric testing side, but there's also some areas that we expect to regain some traction on women's health in area in particular that we would expect that we can see improved performance versus what we've seen over the last year or so.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor, Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: A couple of questions. One, just a quick house cleaning. The HemoCue business that was sold, that was never reported in any of the testing revenue disclosure in the supplemental disclosure, is that right? So when I look at some of the year-over-year changes none of that would have been impacted by the reclass of the HemoCue?
Robert A. Hagemann: That is correct, Gary. It was a product business and it was included in what we previously referred to as our nonclinical testing segment, which today is called Diagnostic Solutions or DS. So it didn't impact any of those other metrics that you saw, volumes or revenue per work [ph].
Kathleen Valentine: And just to clarify, HemoCue is not yet sold. We plan to sell it.
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. 2013 operating margin, I guess, kind of our back of the envelope at the middle of your guidance is that if you deploy after dividend all your free cash flow to repurchase, then the operating margin assumption is roughly flat. And if you repurchased no shares, then operating margin will be down about 100 basis points to kind of get to your midpoint of guidance. So given that you said you'll do more share repurchase, I mean, is that -- are we essentially framing that correctly that somewhere between flat and down 100 basis points is in the range based on the amount of share repurchase?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well we certainly do anticipate doing share repurchases. And as I said earlier, I'd expect that it's going to be greater than the level that we did in 2012, given that the delevering is behind us at this point, although we haven't given specific guidance on that. But the other thing I would mention to you is while we've not provided guidance relative to the operating income percentage, given that we're expecting 3% reimbursement pressure next year, much of the Invigorate savings is going to mitigate that at this point. And you shouldn't expect there to be significant expansion in margins next year.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: In '14, Stephen mentioned double-digit earnings, I guess, given that share repurchase in any given year looks like it could add 5%. You're expecting a little bit of volume growth. Is it fair to say your expectation operating margin in '14 is flat to up?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, let's not go to '14 at this point. We're not prepared to give guidance there, other than as you've heard us say, we are optimistic that we're going to see an uptick in volumes. And certainly, we expect that any incremental volume will start to realize in '14 given what we have done for the cost structure, can be very profitable.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And what we said is that our earnings growth will be a combination of operating improvements, as well as share repurchase.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. So I did hear double-digit earnings growth '14 though earlier in the call. Correct?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: You did, in '14 effectively.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, final question, Bob, could just remind us on '13 and '14 commercial contract renewals. Any of the big guys that stand out for those 2 years?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, this year, there's only one national contract that's coming up. We've mentioned that CIGNA is the one national that's coming up. Every year, we always have regional plans that are coming up that we're dealing with, but just the one single national contract this year.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then '14?
Robert A. Hagemann: We're not going out in terms of '14 and giving a specific guidance on contracts.

Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website -- on our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, during the quarter, we increased adjusted operating income and delivered strong cash flow despite continued soft revenues, thanks in large part to our accelerated Invigorate cost-reduction initiative. In a few minutes, Bob will review the third quarter with you. But I'd like to start by giving an update on the progress we're making to define our path forward to improve our operations, restore growth and capitalize on our market leadership position. Our 2 highest priorities are driving operational excellence and restoring growth. I'd like to share a few words about each. Let me start with operational excellence. Our old organization was too complex, and it failed to let us take advantage of our scale and capabilities. One of my first steps since joining a few months ago has been to lead the design of a new organizational structure that will enable Quest Diagnostics to focus even more on our customer needs, speed decision-making and accelerate cost reductions. By eliminating complexity and empowering employees, we expect we will be able to eliminate 3 management layers or approximately 400 to 600 management positions by the end of 2013. We believe this will contribute about $65 million in savings to our previously announced cost reduction goal of $500 million annual run rate savings versus 2011 as we exit 2014. We have continued to grow the Invigorate savings each quarter. And last quarter, I said I was closely involved with Invigorate and thought we could realize more savings faster than originally anticipated. The acceleration in savings that we've seen throughout the year does increase my confidence in our ability to achieve this goal. And as a result, we now have increased our expectations for run rate savings as we exit this year to $150 million, and Bob will give you further comments on Invigorate in a few minutes. We look forward to sharing some of our detailed growth plans with you next month at our Investor Day. But today, we'd like to share a couple highlights with you of what we expect to do to restore growth. First, the new organization. In addition to allowing us to aggressively drive operational excellence, it will also allow us to focus on our customers better, which will, we believe, over time enable us to restore growth. We are consolidating several sales organizations into a single commercial group, aligned under 1 new leader. Second, in addition to organic growth, we have shared the task for an opportunity [ph] to consider value-creating fold-in acquisitions as part of our disciplined approach to capital deployment. And I'm happy to share that yesterday, we signed an agreement to partner with UMass Memorial Labs to establish a Lab of the Future in Massachusetts. We believe this transaction could become a model for the industry and an opportunity for hospitals and integrated delivery networks to find a sustainable way to participate in diagnostic testing while focusing on their core competency, taking care of patients. We believe this transaction is a good example of the kind of opportunities we will continue to evaluate. So we remain focused on increasing shareholder returns through a combination of improving operational performance and disciplined capital deployment. Now I'd like to turn over to Bob for a detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q3 revenues of $1.9 billion reflect a decrease of 2.9% from the prior year. This compares to a decrease of about 0.5% in the underlying revenues in Q2. Q3 comparables were more challenging, given there were just over 1% fewer business days in the quarter compared to last year and compared to the second quarter. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2% below the prior year. Volume was about 1% below the prior year due principally to fewer business days. Revenue per requisition was also about 1% below the prior year level but relatively unchanged from Q2. Favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per requisition continued to offset reimbursement pressures, with the 1% year-over-year decrease, principally due to business and payor mix changes. Recall that the year-over-year growth in revenue per requisition we reported in the early part of the year was principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera, and we anniversaried that benefit last quarter. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 7% in the quarter, up over 1% from the growth of the last 2 quarters. Q3 revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and health care IT, were about 10% below the prior year and contributed about 1% of the consolidated revenue decrease, with clinical trials driving the most of the decline. As you've heard, despite reporting revenues which were below the prior year, we expanded adjusted margins in the quarter and delivered earnings comparable to the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 matched that of the prior year, and adjusted operating income at 19.1% was 80 basis points above the prior year. Disciplined expense management and accelerated benefits from our Invigorate program were the primary drivers of our expanded margins. Restructuring and integration costs, totaling about $45 million, reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.4% and reported EPS by $0.17. Last year's third quarter included $27 million of restructuring and integration costs, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by about 1.4% and reported EPS by $0.10. As we discussed the last quarter, in connection with our Invigorate initiative, we have offered a voluntary retirement program to certain qualifying employees. We estimate this program will contribute approximately $40 million in annualized savings once fully implemented, which we expect by the first quarter of next year. The program will allow us to reduce the size of our workforce, reduce our average wage bill and update the skills of the workforce. In connection with the program, I told you last quarter that we expect to record charges estimated at about $50 million over the course of the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce. A little over $20 million was incurred in Q3 and is part of the $45 million in restructuring and integration charges I referenced earlier. As you've heard, we have taken action to accelerate some of the savings associated with our Invigorate program. As a result, we now expected to deliver approximately $150 million in run rate savings as we exit the year, up from our earlier estimate of approximately $100 million. This represents about 30% of our $500 million goal. In addition, as you heard last quarter, we are evaluating opportunities which could potentially increase the size of the program and plan to share any updates at our November Investor Day. An area which continues to benefit from Invigorate is billing and collections. We have consistently produced industry-leading metrics in this area but still have room to improve. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved to 3.3% in the quarter. DSOs were 46 days, up 2 days from last quarter, with most of the increase due to the timing of cash receipts, which were affected by the month end falling on a Sunday. Cash from operations was $395 million in the quarter compared to $338 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter compared to $39 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 832,000 common shares at an average price of $60.12 a share for a total of $50 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $150 million. We also reduced outstanding debt by $292 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $507 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year. Turning to 2012 guidance. Based upon our performance through the first 3 quarters and our latest view of the market, we now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow approximately 0.5%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $180 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.55. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Bob. So in closing, this quarter, we increased adjusted operating income and delivered solid cash flow despite a decline in revenues. Our new organization will allow us to aggressively drive operational excellence and improve our customer focus. This will enable us to achieve our Invigorate goal and over time, restore growth. We do remain committed to increasing shareholder returns and improving ROIC. This includes our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio. Yesterday, we announced a transaction that will create value for Quest Diagnostics shareholders, our partner and the people of Massachusetts. I look forward to sharing our strategy and plans with you at our November 16th Investor Day. Now we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Just a couple questions on top line if I could. You lowered your revenue expectations last quarter and again this quarter. So we see some of the results, but what do you think is different versus what you expected 6 months ago as far as top line trend?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, thanks, Tom, for the question. First of all, the market continues to be what we described as soft. Even though we see a pickup in physician office visits from some of the outsourced statistics, we're not just seeing it yet in our volume. So utilization, we believe, is somewhat mixed. Second is that even though that we believe that the market is soft, the market has seen some indications that it is growing in some pockets, but we're not obviously seeing that growth. And so therefore, we actually believe our execution is not quite where we expected it to be. And specifically, we talked about narrowing the networks with payers. We still believe there's an opportunity there, but we have not seen it yet. We're still actively working inside here on getting that and also working with payers to make sure we eventually deliver it. So that's what's changed, Tom.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: On -- maybe just 2 follow-ups. On the networks, these plans that are in place, and you're just not capturing that incremental share as a result of the benefit design, or are you expecting that you're going to see changes that you haven't seen yet in benefit design?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: No, these are plans in place. We just haven't gotten what we expected out of those plans yet.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then overall market share, do you have great data on that? Can you give any good insight on what your share is doing, relatively speaking? And also, maybe specifically relative to hospitals as well, where my sense is maybe they've been taking some more in-house as they've been hiring doctors?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, first of all, we do believe that, that trend in the hospital marketplace is happening. So they are picking up a larger piece of the market. It is hard for us to give visibility on market share. And at our November 16th Investor Day, we'll give you a lot more detail on specifically what's happening in this market and what we think our performance has been in the past and what we think the opportunity is going forward. But at this point, we don't have specifics.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just wondering if you could provide any more color on the UMass acquisition? Was the valuation paid in line with historical multiples? And then also, what are you seeing in the market? Are there other deals that you're excited about, similar size or any color would be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, let me ask Bob to take the question on specifics of the transaction. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Kevin, as we indicated in the press release, we expect this to contribute about 1% to revenues next year for us. And to give you some sense as to valuation, the valuation was less than $100 million. And we would expect that, that sort of valuation is consistent with the types that we've seen for future fold-in acquisitions. This is one that we think is in that sweet spot that we've spoken about. Fold-in acquisition, we've got a good history of executing well against these, and we're very excited about the opportunity to work with UMass in the Massachusetts marketplace.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then, Bob, since I have you, with revenue per requisition being down about 1%, I don't know if you -- I missed it in your prepared remarks, what was the primary driver behind that? I know there's fewer days and whatnot. But...
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Kevin, it's down about 1% from the prior year, although it's relatively stable with the level that we had in Q2. Yes, as we've mentioned before, we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, but we're effectively offsetting that with increases or improvements in test mix and increases in the number of tests per requisition. And what you saw driving most of the year-over-year change this quarter is really the business mix. We continued to see strong growth in Drugs of Abuse Testing, which as you know, has much lower reimbursement rates than average. And unfortunately, we're continuing to see pressure on the Anatomic Pathology side, which carries higher reimbursement rates. So it's really the business mix that's driving the year-over-year change right now.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then, 1 last question for Steve. You mentioned narrower networks and then recently, we found out that Tennessee's Medicaid program selected you as the exclusive testing provider. Wondering if you're seeing anything else on the horizon with some of the other states or payers moving to low-cost provider in the market?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, first of all, Kevin, thank you for that. And we continue to work with all the payers, and we believe having access to as many payers as possible in our business is important. But as you know, we don't provide specifics on relationships with payers but we continue to be aggressively managing our approach to payers going forward. I spoke in my prepared remarks about a new organizational structure. And a key part of that structure is to pull together multiple sales forces within the company. But part of that is to make sure that we emphasize the importance of our payer relationships and health plans going forward. So it's an important of, we believe, our continuing to focus on improving how to go to market. They're an important part of our go-to-market plan, and we need to do a better job than we've done in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just had a follow-up question in terms of the hospital segment. So it seems like if you look over a long period of time, the market share of the hospital labs has remained pretty constant between the 2 dynamics of hospital buying providers and lab buying outreach programs. I'm just curious if you were to look over the long term here, especially under the reform, how do you expect those market share dynamics to change? Is the pendulum kind of shifting back to the hospitals at this point? Or is it still pretty constant between the 2 competing dynamics?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, thanks, Amanda. Well, first of all, I think there's another dynamic and that is to some extent related to reform, and that is hospital systems buying physicians. So we believe 65% of physicians today work for hospital systems. It's a larger percentage of specialists and a lower percentage of primary care, but the percentage of primary care will increase. And as they bring more physicians into their network, we believe this is affecting the dynamic of laboratory services and where that work is performed. We actually believe because of this dynamic, there's been a shift in the market into the hospital side of the equation. Our question mark as we go forward is, is it sustainable? And actually, this transaction we just announced today with UMass I think is an indication that it's not quite clear that all think it's best for hospital systems to be in the laboratory outreach business. So we're watching it carefully. The question earlier was, is there a dynamic that there's more hospitals interested in this type of transaction? There is an increase in activity of hospital CEOs debating what the best answer is for the laboratory services, and we're engaged in those conversations. So the dynamic in the industry is changing, and some of that's related to health care reform, but some of it's related to what's happening with integrated delivery networks.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then, I know this is not really related to outreach, but have you seen any effect from the TC Grandfather situation on your business at this point? And also, just not related, but there's been noise around Anatomic Pathology codes and what they might be doing with that reimbursement? Anything there that you might highlight in terms of impact?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Kathleen?
Kathleen Valentine: Yes, Amanda, it's the -- we've seen very little, if any, impact from the TC Grandfather change.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And what about potential changes to the -- some of the common AP codes?
Kathleen Valentine: No, I mean, we haven't seen anything yet. I mean, I know they're contemplating and expecting some changes on the 88305. We haven't seen what that change is yet. So we haven't seen any impact in terms of our volumes related to that.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Is there a way to quantify how much is 88305 of your volume?
Kathleen Valentine: Well, we don't provide details on specific test volumes.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then last one for Steve, just at a high level here. So obviously, you've done a great job with the Invigorate and the cost restructure side. But I wanted to dive a little deeper into the comments you made about how that could translate into increased customer focus and top line growth? I'm just curious, it's not even been there for a few months. How do you look at the top line side of the equation?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, absolutely. Well, first of all, as you would expect, our Invigorate goal is primarily around cost, and we're encouraged by the results that we've seen so far. And therefore, we've increased our expectation for this year in that regard. But as you know, driving operational excellence is not just about cost, it's affecting the quality of the operation. And so we believe in addition to improving our cost position, we also can improve our service levels. So hand-in-hand with our improvements in costs, we expect that our service levels will improve as well. And so in parallel with all the costs initiatives, we're making sure that we don't deteriorate our service level performance metrics, how quickly we respond to phone calls, how our customer satisfaction scores are going in our patient service centers, what type of response time or turnaround time we have for specimens back to the physician. All those are quite important, and we believe we can improve quality while at the same time reducing our cost structure. And when we do that, we believe that will affect our customer focus and will affect restoring growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have already been asked. I'm just really curious, Steve, as to how you're thinking about reform, should we have Obamacare go into place around lab? And is this the idea around UMass and other deals that you really believe that over time, you're going to see the hospital and the physician bundling and others around lab costs? How should we start to think about that over the next couple of years?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, as you know, Lisa, there's a lot of uncertainty around the environment in general and specifically what's going to happen with health care going forward. As you know, we're in the middle of the election and there's a lot of questions in Washington what will happen over time. Well, first of all, there is a sense that irregardless of who gets into office, that there's some fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act that will be retained. There is a sense that there will be more lives in the system with different insurance options, and we think that's good for this industry. We know the demographics, those demographics have been with us for some time, and those won't change. And so therefore, with the aging population, we believe there will be an opportunity. And also people still believe in early detection and wellness programs, which is good for this industry. But over time, the question is what will happen with all the different payment movement types within the system and what happens to the individual states. And there's a lot of uncertainty, and last quarter, we shared that with you. So it's difficult for us to predict. We do believe overall, the Affordable Care Act is positive for this industry, but the specifics of how that will play out are still uncertain at this time.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: One of the other things we've heard at a recent conference that I think you spoke at, Steve, was around formulary development around clinical laboratories. Are you starting to see that take hold? Or do you think that we're in the very early stages of that? And if we do start to move more towards formularies around clinical lab testing, is that a positive or a negative for Quest?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, first of all, it's just in its early days, and it's hard to indicate or hard to predict will it be a positive or negative at this point. So but it's starting to get some traction, but it's early.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Macquarie.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Just 2 follow-ups on the top line, line of questioning. One, was there -- were there any acquisitions baked into the volume numbers or in volume comps that you reported? And...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Let me give it to Bob to answer that.
Robert A. Hagemann: Essentially, Dane, what you saw is organic revenue year-over-year.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then, just kind of a qualitative assessment on the growth, is there an expectation baked into the revised guidance, and kind of how we should think of revenue growth over the next couple quarters in the context of some of the management changes that were just announced being kind of mildly disruptive to the ability of the organization to grow sales and the focus on customers during this transitional period?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, get me get Bob to give you some qualitative response to the fourth quarter, what that means. And then I'll take the question on -- answer the question about organizational effect on the business going forward. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes. There's nothing specific baked into our guidance relative to any sort of disruption as a result of the organizational change. In fact, if you look at the third quarter revenue growth and you adjust it for the change or the difference in business days, the implied revenue growth in Q4 is pretty consistent with that.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Okay. And specific to organization, we have essentially functionalized the largest part of our company, and we'll be using a term of diagnostic information services. And as we have shared, we brought in a new sales leader. The reason for that is we want to bring sales excellence to this company. Specifically, underneath the new sales leader, and his name is Everett Cunningham, he joins us from Pfizer. He's a seasoned sales executive with over 20 years of experience in a variety of roles. But we want to consolidate all our sales forces and have 1 consolidated view for Quest Diagnostics into the marketplace. Much of this change, much of this change is related to management. And we're reemphasizing to our sales reps, people who are actually calling our customers and driving volume, that their account assignments will not change and -- for the remainder of this year and for the plan going forward. This is about management reorganization and not specific to what they do on a day-to-day basis. So we're reemphasizing that with this transition. And we're meeting every other day as an operational team to make sure that anything that comes up in our organization, we're on top of. So we're on top of this closely to make sure we don't miss a beat in the fourth quarter. But I wanted to share that with you, and then when we get together in November at our Investor Day, we'll share more specifics of what we plan of doing structurally and operationally to be able to restore growth. And you'll get an opportunity to meet Everett Cunningham at that session.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Steve, in your comments, you talked about the narrow networks and that you haven't gotten, I guess, the volumes that you expected to get. Can you talk more about that? Is it simply a leakage issue? And if it is, it seems like the plans in the past have been somewhat hesitant to crack the whip with docs in order to prevent the leakage, so is there anything that's going to change to, you think, stop it?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, thanks, Gary, for the question. It is a leakage issue, and specifically the plans are aligned with us on trying to drive a narrower network. Obviously, if they're incented to do it, we would be incented to do it as well. And yes, they have been reluctant in the past, you call it cracking the whip with physicians. But let me share with you, they've already taken some actions to be able to put some of these physicians that we believe there's an opportunity on notice. And we believe they will be acting more aggressively going forward because it serves our interests well and their interests to do this. So we again are not giving up on it. We believe there's still an opportunity for us going forward, there's an opportunity with the health plans. And we still believe going forward, we'll work on this real time to make it a reality.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Is there anything in the contracts, in it that you have with those more narrow networks that if you don't see the volume increases, and it's not anything that you guys did, does that impact price? Or is there really no way to adjust for that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: No, it's just fundamentally, operationally getting to happen what we planned on happening. And we plan on some things with health plans. We've worked through those. We're reevaluating those actions because they haven't been as successful as we expect that they would be, and so we're putting together a new and improved plan, if you will, plan-by-plan to get the growth we expect.
Operator: Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I wanted to just go back to the UMass deal, and you've described in the press release that you plan to build a Lab of the future. I guess, I would want to get your vision of how different that Lab of the Future is from the current operating model, and maybe give us a little flavor for what your plans are there.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, well, thanks, Darren. This is an opportunity obviously to work with a large health system in Central Massachusetts and bring in some volume to our company. But we're also taking it as an opportunity to continue to invest in our business going forward. And we have a number of operations in the Northeast. We see this as an opportunity to basically architect and then eventually build and equip that organization with a different workflow than we currently have in some of our labs. Also invest in automation and apply the principles that we applied at some of our best labs around our network. And so we're very encouraged that we can take the best learnings that we have throughout our network of labs throughout the United States and apply it to this effort with UMass.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And is this structure a joint venture in any way? Or is it a complete 100% ownership?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, at this point, this is an outright purchase of the outreach business of UMass. And over time, we expect that there'll be a shared financial interest in the new entity. But yes, the transaction, as it stands today, is an outright acquisition of the outreach business.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then -- that's helpful. I'm sure we'll get a little bit more into this in November when we meet. My question on just the revenue side of the equation relates to some anticipated changes we're all looking at for in the short run on the Molecular Diagnostics program. And I guess, I wanted to just hear from you what your expectation is in terms of how quickly you think private payers will pivot to whatever that new pricing model is?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, reactions to new pricing in our forward-looking guidance?
Robert A. Hagemann: Look, as we've seen historically, oftentimes, the commercial payers follow what the government does. And sometimes, it's faster. Sometimes, it's slower. We expect that they're all going to be very deliberate, though, with any changes that take place here so that we get this right. It's too important not to get it right. And it's still, as unfortunately with many things, early days and a little too early to tell what it could mean.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. You mentioned that your trials business experienced some pressure in the quarter. And I guess, I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about that. You have a key customer in that business. Did that change, or is it just the typical starts and stops that occur in the trials business?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, first of all, as you know, the pharma industry is slow. There's less investment going on today than there once was. And that's affecting our business. That's the best way to describe it. So there's some of your typical starts and stops, but there is an industry slowdown, if you will, with trials in general that's affecting our clinical trials business. And that had a substantial effect on our growth rate this quarter.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And my last question is just you talked about returning capital, and I'd be curious to get your thoughts on -- your view on the Celera royalty portfolio, which I think many of us in the market think has significant value to Quest. How should we be thinking about that portfolio, and how you expect to hold it or not over the long term?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, do you want to handle that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Darren, look, this is one that obviously we've gotten a lot of questions on. We're continuing to evaluate all of our options with respect to these assets. And what we want to do obviously is what's in the best interest of the Quest shareholders. So more to come on that. We're still in the process of evaluating the different options that we've got.
Operator: Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Steve, I wanted to maybe put your previous comments on the market environment and market share dynamic in context with Invigorate. And specifically, just wondering how you expect to sort of reclaim market share while also cutting costs. We haven't seen a lot of that as a precedent across the health care system. And maybe specifically, if you could touch on the number or percentage of mid-level management cuts that you mentioned that are actually customer-facing positions?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Well, first of all, I do believe that we can take cost out of the business, and we've indicated that before. And some of the cost we'll take out has no impact on our customer-facing activities. We shared in the past, let me give you an example, as we do believe we can do better job of procurement, buying supplies and the products that we use for operations will have no impact on customer-facing activities. We're looking at our whole administrative cost structure, clearly, we need less of administration so we can put more energy into those activities that will generate growth. So this is another example of where we can take cost out without affecting our top line. As far as the change organizationally, if you look at the organizational structure that we had, we have shared in our announcement about this that we believe we can take out 3 management layers. In the past, the structure that we had between myself and people that are selling or people that are doing blood draws or people working in our laboratories, in some cases, we had as many as 10 layers. And so, we believe that if you look at spans-and-layers and the opportunity to simplify the organization to make sure that we can be faster with decision-making and at the same time, be able to be much more aligned or around our 2 primary goals, which is driving operational excellence and restoring growth, this will help us. These cost reduction activities are all around management, all around management. So I would argue these are the people in the back, so the people that are doing the work, people that are selling, people that are doing blood draws, people that are dealing with the customers every day. And we believe that by reducing management and simplifying organizational structure, it'll impact and help us accelerate our ability to achieve our operational excellence goals and at the same time, by focusing more entirely as a company on our customer, it'll help us restore growth.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Isaac, just to build on something that Steve said before about lower costs and improve service levels going hand-in-hand. We clearly think there's an opportunity to improve service levels as we reduce costs. A great example is the fact that we touch specimens, we touch bills over and over again, a lot of manual work is done here. And as we increase electronic connectivity, which is one of the elements of the Invigorate program, we take that waste out of the system and at the same time, we improve the service levels for customers. So that's a good example of how we can improve service levels and reduce costs at the same time.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And Isaac, let me just say 1 other comment and that is, we do believe as we go through our plan, and you'll see some of this at our Investor Day, that we will become more efficient. And we're looking at all our business, all our operations and looking at our resource allocation and where we invest to make sure we're putting an appropriate investment in terms of what we need to do to improve operational excellence. So truing up our operations, making sure we put in place best-in-class information systems and processes. We talked about the Lab of the Future at UMass. But also, we're looking at a go-to market organization to make sure we're putting the right resources in that organization. And we think actually our Invigorate program will give us some financial capacity, if you will, to make some of those investments as well. So we're looking at all that to make sure we're properly balanced to accomplish what we say we can accomplish by improving our operations and restoring growth at the same time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So one question I have -- this was touched on a couple times now, but just to follow up further on the press release from last week on the organizational structure changes. And I guess, I'm a little surprised that with the company already completing some pretty comprehensive cost-cutting programs over the past several years, I guess I'm surprised there's still 3 layers of management to still cut out of the infrastructure. So I'm just curious, this must have come up in some of the internal discussions. I'm just trying to get maybe more flavor for why these layers were not eliminated in the prior rounds of cost cutting. There must have been some risk in doing this. I'm trying to figure out why this, I guess, so obvious to do it now. So I guess that's the first question.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Well, thank you for that. Well, I can't say much about the past. I do understand why the structure was here, and from the -- going forward, we believe it's not the right structure for us with our 2 primary goals around operational excellence and restoring growth. What we announced in the organizational change is essentially disbanding the line of business structure throughout the company for the Diagnostic Information Services business. This will allow us to simplify the organization and take out some management positions. And fundamentally, it'll allow us to take advantage of our scale and capabilities operationally. So we're going to bring together all our operational capabilities underneath 1 leader, that person is John Haydon. John will be joining us actually from Philips. I've worked with John in the past, actually brought him into Philips about 3 years ago. He has the absolute best capabilities that we could find for this job. We did an external search. We talked to a number of individuals. I personally was engaged in this and talked to over a dozen people. We brought them through the management team, and we spent time to make sure we had the best possible person we could find. So under John's leadership, we believe we can consolidate, if you will, all our operational activities; think about the full value chain, from specimen to eventual cash; the organization and by thinking about it holistically as a company, we could take the next tranche of improvement, if you will, for this company. So we think it is the right structure going forward to be able to support the goals that we have in Invigorate and over time, as we say, restore growth.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the code stocking issue just for a second. This bulletin went out from CMS on September 1 where CMS is now saying that the Medicare carriers themselves, which are owned by the commercial payers like WellPoint, Cigna, Blues Plans, et cetera, these are the guys that are going to be determining these new rates for these 100 or so molecular tests. So I guess, I'm just trying to get some color from you guys. How common is it for the commercial payers or entities owned by commercial payers to have a major say in what the rates are going to be in terms of reimbursement to the lab providers? And does this make you on the margin a little more nervous about these rates are going to be coming out, or is this maybe a little more routine than some of us may believe? Some color on that would be helpful as well.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Kathleen, you want to handle that?
Kathleen Valentine: Sure. Steve, the CMS is charged with providing the direction and the guidance on how the new codes and the reimbursement for these new codes should be done. And as you know, kind of what's proposed is sort of a gap-fill approach. There are a lot of questions that we in the industry have that we've put to CMS in terms of how that will be done and the timeframe with which to do it. I don't think it's all that common that they typically give the commercial payers, the individual payers, kind of the discretion to set reimbursement. But there are a lot of questions that the industry is asking, and centered -- starting with what the process is, to your point, in terms of who is -- the steps to take in terms of setting that reimbursement and also concerns around the timeframe with which to do it in terms of right now it's slated to go into effect in the beginning of '13. So there's a lot to be -- still be sorted out. We are working with industry through the trade association...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And taking the leadership role.
Kathleen Valentine: Absolutely. And looking to get CMS to provide more specifics and instruction on exactly how to do that because we certainly -- we don't want it to be a disparate sort of approach. We want it to be thoughtful and want the industry's best interests protected through the process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sandy Draper from Raymond James.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 questions. First, maybe just talk a little bit on the charges, obviously, it's sort of ongoing process. Do you have a target date with the -- with Invigorate can be going on for a while, in which you would expect the charges to stop and we'll get sort of a clean GAAP quarter? Or should we expect at least for most of 2013 to continue to see quarterly charges?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Sandy, as you know, the program that we've defined to date runs through the end of 2014. We've put some estimates out there as to what the charges will be over the life of that program. With the added amount of charges we expect from the management reorganization, the totals now are between $115 million to $195 million over the course of that period. And the biggest chunk of that is in employee separation costs, a large portion of which we've incurred to date. But you should expect that we'll continue to see charges over the next several quarters at a minimum, probably in some cases, stretching into 2014. As we said earlier, the voluntary severance or the voluntary retirement program is going to result in charges over the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And those are all pretty much cash charges, correct?
Robert A. Hagemann: Most of the charges will be cash charges. There will be some asset write-downs and the like as we start to restructure the testing network. But the majority of the charges are going to be cash charges.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just 1 follow-up. I know a lot of people have asked about the pricing environment. As I sort of think about it and summarizing what you're saying, Bob, on the positive side, you're getting more tests per session and you continue to see the esoteric mix benefiting. On the negative side, you've got continued pressures in pathology, commercial and government payers pricing pressure there. I guess my question is, one other thing that we're hearing about is the, what I would say, commoditization of esoteric testing whereas historically, you might have a 3- to 5-year window for sort of premium pricing, that window seems to be shortening maybe down to a 1- to 2-year, I'd say. Are you guys seeing that, and how do you factor that in? And then when you think longer term, if these trends persist, are we in an environment where flat pricing is maybe a best case scenario or maybe the negative? Or do you think longer term, there are things that you can do to actually eventually get pricing to actually go back on the positive side?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, just on some of those. Yes, let's talk about first the timeframe and the migration of esoteric to routine. I'm not sure that we've necessarily witnessed a shortening of that. As you do know, though, most tests, and in fact, we hope that tests that start out as esoteric will ultimately become routine because that means the utilization ramps up and as you know, as we go through that lifecycle of a test, the revenues ramp up, the margin percent probably comes down as reimbursement comes down, costs also come down, margin dollars grow over time, so that's a good thing as we see utilization increase. And we expect that as we look ahead, the pipeline of new tests will continue to be very robust. So we're expecting that test per requisition, test mix will continue to favorably impact revenue per requisition for us. But as you know, things that do start out as esoteric over time migrate to routine, but we haven't seen necessarily an acceleration of that trend. It takes a while for physicians to change behaviors and adopt things. I mean, we have some evidence that says that it takes between 6 and 8 years for a test to be fully adopted and utilized. So I'm not sure I see anything that's necessarily going to dramatically accelerate that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Most of my question's answered, just had 2. First, when you look at 2013 estimates, the Street is anticipating a little less than 3% revenue growth, yet your revenue growth has been decelerating this year, down almost 3% this quarter. Is it sensible that some of the initiatives you've put in place could actually get revenue to grow in 2013? Or as we anniversary this deceleration in the back half, is that less likely in that timeframe?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, you want to...
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Gary. You're clearly going to hear a lot more about our plans at the Investor Day in November. And just to set expectations, though, we're not anticipating providing 2013 guidance there. We're certainly going to talk about our plans in great detail and hopefully, get you very comfortable with what we expect to accomplish with them. But we'll be giving 2013 guidance in connection with our year-end earnings call in January.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Second and last question, just going to capital deployment. Steve, I know that the previous CEO had established that the majority of free cash flow would be turned to shareholders, you've reiterated that commitment today. When we'd look at the first 9 months of the year, I think 34% of the free cash flow generation has been returned via share repurchase and the existing dividend. So assuming that the majority means some number greater than 50%, on that front, how quickly do you expect to move to a much higher payout ratio or accelerated share repurchase?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. So let me start with just reiterating what we have said, and we continue to stand by our word that it is our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors and then we are going to achieve our targeted leverage ratio. That's point #1. Point #2 is we will have the Investor Day, and we'll be sharing more insight into capital deployment specifically going forward, and we look forward to having that conversation with you then. So Bob, would you like to share…
Robert A. Hagemann: And Gary, just to reiterate what we said earlier, we said, return the majority of free cash flow to investors after achieving our targeted leverage ratio, which we indicated would require us to pay down between $500 million to $700 million of debt this year. We're almost there. We've paid down $500 million year-to-date, so it implies that there's not much more to go. And by the end of this year, we'll have the debt level where we're comfortable. And then, we certainly have the flexibility that we want to return the majority of free cash flow to investors beginning in 2013. But we made it very clear that, that's after we achieve targeted leverage ratios.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Have a couple of questions here. Steve, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty around consolidation of physician offices and ACOs and health care reform. But can you share with us what's been your experience with the pioneering ACOs that have been doing this for a year or 2, this could be a proxy for what we could expect in the future?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Well, thanks for the question. As you have said, Ricky, there's a lot of change going on in health care, and probably the biggest change, fundamentally, in terms of provision of health care is around hospital systems buying physician practices. And that is a big change, and I made some comments about that earlier today that it is affecting, at least in the short run, with some of the ancillary services and where that work is directed because of their ownership of those physicians. You mentioned ACOs, and as you know, ACOs are a part of the Affordable Care Act, and there are a lot of these pioneer organizations. And some portion of those organizations are around hospital systems, but some portion of those organizations are actually around physician groups. And we are deeply engaged with many of these organizations because also the health plans are quite interested in engaging as well because the model in the short run is a fee for service model. But in the future, it is anticipated that there will be more of a capitated payment reimbursement model, which will fundamentally change how health care is paid for in this country. We believe that, that obviously will take some time because it's complicated, as you know. But we're in active conversations with payers, with providers both on the physician side, as well as hospital systems. And frankly, you see one ACO, you see 1 pioneer ACO, you see 1 ACO, 1 pioneer ACO. Everyone has a different approach, everyone is thinking through this and everyone is anticipating that it's here to say, but it's not quite sure at this point to how we will eventually merge into some more standardized model of how they'll operate. So a lot of question marks, a lot of uncertainties, a lot of work in play right now, and we're right in the middle of it.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then something that is more in your control, you highlighted that the cost saving run rate is now at $150 million, I think, versus the early expectation of $100 million run rate for the year.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, that's correct.
Robert A. Hagemann: As we exit this year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: As you exit, yes. So can you updated us as to what was your run rate is off this third quarter? And then, so we can just understand also the offset as we build our model, should we assume that just ongoing expense grow with CPI, and are there any additional costs that you need to take on to accommodate the potential incremental volumes that will be associated with the Affordable Care Act assuming that we see implementation?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Ricky, this is Bob. Let me take the latter part of the question first, and that is, the cost associated with incremental volumes. Clearly, what we're doing with the Invigorate program is reducing costs across-the-board, both fixed costs and variable costs. So as we see incremental volumes come into the network as a result of health care reform and the like and our actions as well, we expect that they're going to deliver incremental profit greater than we would have otherwise had. So we're feeling very good about what that can ultimately deliver. With respect to what the run rate is at the end of any given quarter or how much of Invigorate savings is in any one given quarter, we're trying to stay away from getting into that level of detail. I think the best way for you to measure how we're proceeding and how we're progressing with the program is looking at what's happening with margins, and I think we've demonstrated that we've had some good uplift there this quarter. Obviously, we're seeing benefits from the Invigorate program. As you know, I think I've spoken about in the past, generally, we've got about $130 million of inflation that we need to give up or need to cover every year. Roughly $3 billion salaries, wages and benefits, we're seeing sort of 3% average inflation on that historically. And then, the other $3 billion in costs inflates in the range of 1% to 1.5% a year. So that's one of the first things that we need to offset with the Invigorate program before we can get some margin expansion. And obviously, we're starting to see that.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Ricky, let me just add, in my prepared remarks, what we did share is that we are seeing Invigorate savings each quarter increase. And because of this acceleration in savings, it gives us more confidence in fact, we're going to be able exceed the $100 million exit run rate this year, and we've moved the number up to $150 million. So and I shared in my remarks that I am presently engaged in this and I spent a lot of time on this in my first 5 months. I'm encouraged because as you know, with these programs, it takes some time to get traction. We're seeing that traction quarter-on-quarter sequentially. We're seeing improvement, and that is giving us confidence that we can exceed our goal for this year, and we're well on track for the goals for the program.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And based on our back of the envelope calculation, we get to around $100 million in run rate as of this quarter, so we're definitely seeing this sequential improvement that you're talking about. I was just trying to see whether we're in the ballpark.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Frelick of Canaccord.
Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Just 2 quick questions on the UMass Medical announcement. Not sure of your market share in the New England area, but I think you do have a solid presence. Any concerns there with FTC weighing in on the UMass Medical acquisition? And then just kind of second point to that, can you characterize their test mix, does it -- is it that obvious that you can convert a lot of your specialty in esoteric testing into this new entity?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Bob, why don't you talk about when we expect to complete this transaction?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, the transaction is obviously subject to regulatory review. We don't expect that's going to be an issue. And we're anticipating the transaction to close within the next 90 days or so. Relative to test mix and the like, yes, the outreach business that we see there is pretty consistent with the sort of test mix that we have in our operations in Massachusetts. But we do believe there's an opportunity to bring some of the testing capabilities that we have, some of the esoteric testing capabilities we have more broadly to that marketplace now.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Let me just add to that. We actually believe this will be a value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. We believe that it will be accretive to our earnings in 2014. We believe it will be accretive to our projected ROIC in 2015. And let me share with you that as an organization, we are putting in place the operating plan and the integration plan to make this a real success because we believe this can be potentially a model of future opportunities with integrated delivery networks. So we're very optimistic about the opportunity to build shareholder value, and we're going to go after it.
Operator: Our last question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just 1 quick follow-up. Now that Palmetto's Molecular Diagnostics program has been in effect since either May or June, just wondering if you've seen any impact, one way or another, on either reimbursement or claims processing time? Anything like that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Kevin, nothing significant at this point. There are still obviously some things that we're trying to work through with them, get some clarity on a number of things and in some cases, maybe change some perspectives that they have. But this I would expect is part of the normal process of going through this significant a change.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. So really no big expectations on changes for your reimbursement with that region, J1?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, nothing material at this point.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Over the last 2 months, I've had an opportunity to meet with many of you. And for those of you that I have not had an opportunity to meet, I'd like to spend just a minute explaining why I joined Quest Diagnostics. First of all, this is a company that has an impact on healthcare. We touch about 150 million patients each year, and I believe there's an opportunity to touch more lives. Second, this is the high-quality company in many ways. Healthcare professionals particularly have high regard for Quest Diagnostics. And then finally and most importantly, I believe there is a significant opportunity to drive shareholder value. So over the past 2 months, I've met with many of our stakeholders. I've met with employees, customers and investors. I visited many of our operations, and I'm rounding out my perspective on Quest Diagnostics, where the company is today, and how it can grow stronger. I really appreciate the feedback I've received. Now I'd like to share the results for the second quarter. In our Q1 call, we cautioned that despite our positive volume performance, the underlying market conditions remain sluggish, and that it was premature to conclude that the market was recovering. Our caution was warranted. In the second quarter, our volume growth slowed. Sluggish market conditions continue to affect our business, and we saw softness across many of our businesses. We also could have executed better in the quarter. For example, we did not see the benefits we expected from actions we have taken to drive revenue growth in areas like women's health and the benefit from the narrowing of certain health plan networks. As a result, we intensified our actions to manage our costs, allowing us to deliver bottom line growth and margin expansion of the quarter and maintaining our earnings outlook for the year. Specifically, despite essentially flat revenues, we increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 or 4.5%. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points to 18.4%, and we generated $251 million of operating cash flow. Clearly, it is imperative that we continue to be vigilant in improving productivity, reducing costs and improving quality. We are executing a plan in this regard, and we now call it Invigorate. It is expected to deliver $500 million in run rate cost savings versus 2011 as we exit 2014. And I will share with you that we are firmly on track. Well, this is a top priority for me. From my first week on the job, I've been personally involved in Invigorate. I've shared with the organization that I'm personally chairing this effort. I've met with the teams focused on the biggest priority, the areas like lab operations, procurement, general administration, IT, to name a few. We will continue to meet on a regular operating rhythm. Each of these teams are required to manage their projects with structured, disciplined and rigorous program management approaches, and I am assuring that proper resources are properly deployed to these efforts. Finally, I am challenging the teams to additional -- to look for additional opportunities and to accelerate the pace at which we implement the program. An opportunity we've already acted on was to accelerate the launch of a voluntary retirement program offered to certain qualified employees. We expect this program to deliver $40 million in annualized cost savings, a portion of which will be realized this year, with the full amount realized as we exit the first quarter of 2013. Now as we look at the market, we continue to see weakness in the near term. We believe that this industry will grow 4% to 5% in a normal economy, and that Quest Diagnostics should be able to grow at or above the market growth rate. One thing that we believe will enable growth is the Affordable Care Act, which we expect will have a positive net impact on the company in the industry's growth rate beginning in 2014. The act will increase covered lives, which will drive diagnostic testing volume. But at the same time, many of the newly insured will be covered by insurance products with lower price points and, therefore, the full impact on our business is still unfolding. In parallel with Invigorate, we have work to do to restore growth and be in a stronger position when the market recovers. Over the past 2 months, we have been conducting a thorough review of our businesses and our operations. This effort includes an evaluation of our selling and marketing efforts, how we prioritize our innovation investments, and our ability to leverage our unique assets to bring diagnostic solutions to the market. We do have some good examples of what we need to replicate to grow this business. Specifically, our expanding prescription drug monitoring business, our introduction of neurological tests at Athena, and our launch of new companion diagnostics like STRATIFY JCV test are a few good growth examples. So I look forward to sharing with you later this year the growth plans that results from this process. Now I'd like to turn it over to Bob for more detailed analysis of the numbers. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Q2 revenues of $1.9 billion reflect growth of 20 basis points over the prior year. In the second quarter, comps were more challenging than in the first quarter. Specifically, we anniversaried the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, and did not experience the favorable weather impact we saw in the first quarter. These 2 factors combined contributed just over 5% growth in Q1. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Q2 revenues were down about 0.5% from the prior year. This compares to about 1% underlying growth in Q1. As Steve noted, market softness continued to impact our business. We didn't execute as we had planned and, as a result, our volume growth slowed. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were about 1% for the quarter, all attributable to volume. Revenue per requisition was essentially unchanged from the prior year, with reimbursement pressure offset by favorable test mix and an increased number of tests per requisition. Recall that year-over-year growth in revenue per requisition we reported in Q1 was principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera, and we have anniversaried that benefit this quarter. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with the growth of the last 2 quarters. Q2 revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and healthcare IT, were about 5% below the prior year. As you've heard, despite what was an essentially flat top line, we expanded margins -- earnings and margins in the quarter as a result of disciplined expense management and beginning to realize the benefits of our Invigorate program. Adjusted EPS of $1.17 was $0.05 above the prior year, and adjusted operating income at 18.4% was 70 basis points above the prior year. The restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling about $16 million reduced reported operating income by 80 basis points and reported EPS by $0.06. Last year's second quarter included $20 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which reduced reported operating income by a full percentage point and reported EPS by $0.10. Our Invigorate program continues on-track to deliver roughly $100 million in run rate savings as we exit this year. This represents about 20% of our $500 million goal, with the remainder expected in 2013 and 2014. As you heard from Steve, we're continuing to evaluate opportunities, which could potentially increase our goal for this program. As we previously shared, common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases, increased use of automation and technology and centralizing the selective outsourcing. As we noted last quarter, over the next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure. In addition, as we disclosed in last quarter's 10-Q, our high-level estimates of charges we expect to incur over the next several years in connection with this program are between $100 million and $175 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, facility-related closure costs, asset impairments and systems conversion and integration costs. As Steve mentioned, in connection with the Invigorate initiative, we have offered a voluntary retirement program to certain qualifying employees. We estimate this program will contribute approximately $40 million of annualized savings once fully implemented, which we expect by the first quarter of next year. The program will allow us to reduce the size of our workforce, reduce our average wage bill and update the skills of the workforce. In connection with the program, we expect to record charges estimated at about $50 million over the course of the next several quarters as employees leave the workforce. An area which is already benefiting from Invigorate is billing and collections. We have consistently produce industry-leading metrics in this area, but still have room to improve. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5% in the quarter and reflects improvement from both Q1 and in the prior year. DSOs were 44 days, unchanged from last quarter. Cash from operations was $251 million in the quarter compared to $60 million in the prior year. Note last year's cash flow was reduced by the net impact of the Medi-Cal settlement payment. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $40 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 882,000 common shares at an average price of $56.70 for a total of $50 million. We also repaid $112 million of outstanding debt in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year. Turning to guidance. Based on our performance in the first half and our latest view of the market, we now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow between 1% and 2%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $200 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.60. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Bob. So in closing, we delivered earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter despite flat top line growth. We are accelerating our efforts to improve productivity, reduce costs, improve quality and restore top line growth. I want to reaffirm our commitment to increasing shareholder returns and improving our ROIC. This includes our intention to return the majority of our free cash flow to investors upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio. In the near term, we do not expect to complete any large acquisitions. However, we will continue to consider value-creating, fold-in acquisitions. We are being thoughtful and disciplined in developing our plan to restore top line growth and improve shareholder returns, and are performing a thorough review of our businesses and operations as part of this process. I'll share with you that I believe we're moving with the appropriate speed and intend to share our plan with you in the fall. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess, I have 2 questions. Steve, when you had met with some of the analysts recently in a breakfast in New York, I think, you had mentioned that you were sort of meeting with a lot of different constituencies within the company and outside the company. And I think, specifically, you had talked about maybe having some upcoming meetings with some of the payers like in Aetna, for example. The lack of pricing sort of, of late has stood out. So can you discuss any takeaways maybe that you've had thus far with your interactions with major payers? And how they are viewing you and what your -- what, again, your key takeaways may be so far?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, sure. I appreciate the question, Tom. First of all, I have done that. I've met with a number of payers. And specifically what I'd share with you is they're thinking about our business and specifically us to help them manage their cost structure. And yes, that will be a discussion around price at some point. But more importantly, more at a strategic level, is what we can do to help manage plans together to improve quality and lower cost. And specifically, some of that conversation has lended itself to what we have from information, what they have from information and how we can provide more helpful insight into managing overall cost with the lives that they're managing. In parallel with that, they're also understanding that the U.S. market will go through tremendous change with the Affordable Care Act. They're trying to prepare themselves for the change. We obviously are preparing ourselves for the change. And in that context, they believe that they need to do a better job of working with us on narrowing their networks for what would they provide. So therefore, they hope to work more closely with us to make sure that we work together because we're both incented to do that. So the conversations I've had so far, Tom, have been very, very good conversations with the spirit of cooperation. We are working together to do what's right for this industry, improving quality, lower cost and at the same time, we find some opportunities to help our businesses.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then my other quick question was just on healthcare reform. Sorry, I jumped on a couple of seconds late so if you covered it, I apologize. But just wanted to see if you had any takeaways at this stage on sort of how you think about the impact and what some of the moving parts are for Quest in particular?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act, we do expect to have a -- excuse me, a net positive impact on our company and the industry growth rates. And we believe this will start in 2014. First of all, the number of lives will increase. We know that, and that will drive volumes. That's good news. But at same time and what's not clear yet is what will happen with those newly insured lives and what insurance products they will move to. And our sense is that some, if not a large majority, will go to lower-price-point products and, therefore, it's not quite clear at this point how this will all unfold. So we have not put together specific indication of what it will mean for our business. We're watching it carefully. There are some positive sides of it, and there's clearly some negative sides of it. And in collective perspective, it will have an effect. We believe, again, it's net positive impact for our business and for the industry, but it still has to be cleared up over time.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Steve, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the reimbursement pressure that you saw this quarter. Is that coming from any specific contracts? Or what's going on, on that front?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, first of all, we don't share specifics on what's going on with our contracts, but we have shared in the past that we are seeing pressure on price. And let me give the microphone over to Bob to share some of the specifics of what we have shared in the past and how that is folded through our numbers.
Robert A. Hagemann: Kevin, yes, I would tell you that this is nothing new. I mean, we've been talking about increased reimbursement pressure for a while, and what we're seeing was fully contemplated in the guidance that we put together at the end of the year. So there's no change from our perspective there. And essentially what you're seeing is that reimbursement pressure now is being offset though by a number of tests per requisition and a continued favorable test mix. And as we go forward, we expect that those dynamics will continue, continued reimbursement pressure to a large degree offset, if not fully offset, by test per rec and positive mix.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Sure. And then, I guess, since I have you, Bob, just wondering what are your thoughts on the Medicare pricing headwinds that you face in '13? And also the impact of the new Molecular Diagnostic codes that are likely to go in effect in '13?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Kevin, the Medicare change for 2013 is estimated to be about 5% or so. I think we've shared with folks in the past that we've got roughly $1 billion in Medicare business. The vast majority of that reimbursed off of the clinical lab fee schedules. So we're looking at a $40 million to $50 million impact next year. And as you think about that, we're hoping that much of that now is going to be offset by the actions that we've taken at the Voluntary Severance Program, which kick in -- fully kick in by the time we exit the first quarter of next year. And with respect to the impact of the changes around Molecular Diagnostics and the new coding there, we don't expect that to have a significant impact to us. There are a number of codes which are impacted, but the total revenues that are subject to those changes are less than 5% of our total revenues. And as we've said in the past, the objective there is really to get better visibility into what's being billed, making sure that what's being billed is medically necessary. And we do feel very good about the tests that we have in our profiles, and the medical necessity attached to them.
Kathleen Valentine: And Kevin, as you know, CMS hasn't determined yet how they're going to reimburse for these new molecular codes and also which fee schedule they will be placed on. And at this stage, based on the meetings they had earlier this week in Washington, it sounds like we won't hear anything definitively until later in the fall, some time on that.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then just one last quick one for Steve. As you've gone around the company and looked at the various business units and met with different people, just wondering if you've had a chance to think about some of the other businesses like India in the point-of-care, HemoCue business. If you have any opinions on those fronts, we'd love to hear what you have to think or have to say?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, well, I appreciate that. And what I've said in my opening remarks is that we are conducting a thorough review of all businesses and operations. And we have nothing to share beyond that today. What I've also shared is that sometime in the fall, we will be giving an update of our strategy and in that update we'll give you more forward-looking visibility and transparency of what we're thinking about in terms of restoring growth, improving our margins in going forward for the company.
Operator: Our next question is from Dane Leone with Macquarie.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: I was actually just kind of looking for some clarity on the revenue line and maybe some additional commentary on the Athena and Celera business. Maybe I just kind of misheard, I think, maybe Bob's comments. But it seems like the product line may have declined year-over-year because the revenue per rec was flat, volume was up, but overall revenues were flat. Can you just maybe add some color or provide some clarity on that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Dane, let me try and give you some more color on it. Year-over-year, consolidated revenues were essentially flat, up 20 basis points versus the prior year. In that, the clinical testing business was up about 1% or so. The other businesses, which make up about 10% of our revenues, which include clinical trials testing, risk assessment, the point-of-care business, the healthcare IT business, they in total were down about 5% versus the prior year. And when you look at the clinical testing business, the year-over-year revenue improvement was principally driven by volume. And as we indicated, the revenue per rec was essentially flat year-over-year.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay. Was there -- I guess, the product growth had been additive up until this point for the last couple of quarters. Well, what kind of changed there?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Dane, the principal contribution to product revenue growth that we had in the last several quarters was the result of the operations that we -- the products operations we acquired with Celera, which anniversaried this quarter.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay. So okay, that's helpful. And just on Athena, the -- is that business still growing much higher than the regular business? I was just -- it closed at the end of February last year, so it still had -- thinking about the higher growth rate of that business, maybe it could have added something to revenue per rec this quarter? I was just curious if there was anything there and maybe the Celera business as well.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Athena is continuing to perform very well, growing nicely, highly profitable business. And Celera, as you know, there were multiple pieces to that business. There was the products business, which continues to perform solidly. And then there was BHL, which as we noted is in a turnaround and we're still working through that, although I would tell you that we're making some progress there as we integrate that now and start to leverage the infrastructure that Quest Diagnostics has to offer to Celera.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay, great. And then a final question for me. Just looking at the kind of working capital inventories and accounts receivable, you kind of like edged-up year-over-year even though revenues were flat. Is there anything to read into that or is it just timing?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's just timing. If you look at DSOs, they were essentially flat. We're actually down a day from year end. And if you look historically at how receivables themselves track from Q1 to Q2, that's pretty -- from year-end to Q2, that's pretty consistent.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of follow-up questions here. The first one is on healthcare reform. And Steve, what percent of your book currently do you estimate is from the uninsured population today?
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky, this is Bob. It's a small portion of our total revenues. If you look at what we describe as patient billed revenues, it's in the range of 5% to 10% of our total revenues. Roughly half of that is from the uninsured. The other half is really deductibles and co-pays and things like that.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And when we -- when you think about the opportunity, do you expect to basically see a similar share gains that reflect your overall exposure to government business? Or do you think that you have an opportunity here to gain share above that kind of, that 15% government that you currently...
Stephen H. Rusckowski: And as we said, we do believe it's a net positive impact for our company. And as you know, this is still unfolding and so we're trying to understand it better and better every day. We'll -- there'll be more lives. There'll be more people getting tested. But the question is how will they be insured? And then, specifically, how does that factor into our business? And we have not provided a specific effect on the business because it's not quite clear yet. So can't provide you any more transparency or visibility beyond that at this point.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then a top line question, and I apologize if you have discussed it already. I just had to jump on a little bit late. When we think about the top line growth for the second half of the year, your guidance implied some continued decline. It sounds as if your view is based on pricing trends in the second half the year. Can you share with us your views on kind of like volume trends in the second half and how can you drive volume growth with your internal initiative?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so first of all, what we did share is that sluggish market conditions did continue in the second quarter. It did affect our business. And in fact, in Q2, we did see the volumes -- the volume growth slow. And we saw slowness across many of our businesses. And what I also shared in my opening comments is we do have an opportunity to execute better. We missed some opportunities in Q2, and then we specifically called out that our women's health business could have executed better. And specifically, we have some opportunities around narrowing of certain health plan networks, and we didn't see the impact of that in Q2. And so what I have shared is that in the process of building our plan going forward, we do need to restore growth. And so we are looking at the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs. We're looking at our investments. We're looking at how we product-ize solutions to the marketplace, and that work will be helping us to some extent in the second half, but we still need some help from the market.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Ricky, just a little bit more color on your question. If you look at the implied guidance for the second half, at the midpoint, it implies that revenues are sort of flat for the most part. At the high-end, it implies revenues are up about 1% and at the low end, it implies they're down about 1%.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And at that high-end where revenues are going to be up 1%, based on your pricing comments, should we assume that most of the growth is going to come from volume in the second half?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, again, as you know we don't give guidance relative to price or volume. And at this point, we don't necessarily see that changing. Although I don't think that the dynamics in the second half are going to be materially different than the dynamics in the first half.
Operator: Your next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Gavin Weiss, in for Lisa Gill. You mentioned your conversations you've been having lately with payers. Do any of these conversations include discussions around different payment models? Or is it still really around a fee-for-service?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, there is conversation about different payment models. We are going through this transition and the question is as we go forward with the Affordable Care Act... [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: I apologize. If we're ready, we can go on to the next question. We do have a question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Security.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Steve, for a long time, there was pricing stability. And it then seems like 5 to 6 years ago, the industry started to see pressure on price. I mean, given what you've seen so far, do you think there is a path back towards pricing stability and what are the challenges with getting there?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, well, first of all, that's quite an interruption. So Gary, good question. And frankly, as Bob said, we don't give guidance on price. The market is unfolding with all the different changes, and we have this mix issue going on. So we're managing it carefully. There's no question in our mind though that we need to be vigilant on productivity improvements, reducing costs and improving our operations and that's why I've been personally involved in Invigorate and will continue to be involved. We need to improve our cost structure, and that will help us offset whatever price erosion we see going forward. So Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add to that?
Robert A. Hagemann: The only thing I would add, Gary, is we're going to continue to be price disciplined as we go forward. And as Steve mentioned, the payers and our other partners are looking for ways that we can work with them to reduce their total costs. Pricing is an element of that, but there are other ways as well that we can help them manage their costs down, and we expect to use all of those opportunities.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess, maybe, if I could ask it another way, Steve. I know -- without you guys commenting on price, specifically, but more generally -- with the large labs being the low-cost provider of the service, significantly less in some cases than hospitals, what's putting the pressure on the price? How did -- what was the catalyst that started the pricing pressure, and how do we get away from that?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, there's price pressure in this whole industry as you know, so the catalyst is healthcare in general. Healthcare costs from a provider perspective continues to rise and that's the challenge with health plans. And they're trying to manage an aging population, sicker and sicker lives every year and, therefore, the -- and costs that continue to rise. So there's more pressure throughout this entire industry and as you know, we've been in this industry for over 28 years. That price pressure will continue. The question is how does that unfold and how does that relate to this market, specifically, with the changes that we see going forward? We are seeing people wanting to narrow their networks. Therefore, there should be more consolidation in the volumes around fewer suppliers of laboratory testing services that plays nicely into what we are all about and what this industry is all about. Second, is as hospital systems are acquiring physician practices, they're looking at what they need to do in terms of what of their capabilities are strategic and not strategic. And as they start to look at forming Accountable Care Organizations, what they do with their laboratory operations and they are starting to have more conversations with us in terms of how we can help them with laboratory management services, where we could potentially look at outsourcing, where we can look at reference testing. And so the future trend, despite price pressure, I think, lends itself to support the long-term normal growth rates we see in this industry. So I see some other dynamics that will help us offset some of the price pressure that we will see like the rest of the industry.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Gary, when we talk about price pressure, we're not talking exclusively about the commercial payers. As you see on the government side, there's continued reimbursement pressure. Medicare is a great example. The Medicaid -- each of the states is looking at how they can reduce their overall costs, and healthcare is a big element of their total cost and they're trying to manage it down. So it's not exclusively the commercial payers that we're talking about when we talk about reimbursement pressure.
Operator: And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: There's been articles on benefit design, and you certainly talked about narrowing networks and particularly, we've seen or heard about changes at Aetna that could potentially push more volume your way. I guess, did you recently renegotiate with Aetna beyond the extension from a couple of years ago sort of in exchange for some of the narrowing network there?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, we don't comment on specific renegotiations or discussions with our health plan partners. But we do believe there is an opportunity to work with them to narrow their network, and you brought up Aetna as an example of that.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then going back to sort of some of the discussion around reform, can you help us right now in terms of collection on the uninsured. What percentage of what you bill do you collect?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, Bob will handle that, yes.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, one way of thinking about it is the majority of our bad debt, which this quarter was 3.5%, comes from patient bill. And about half of that bad debt is related to co-pays and deductibles for people that have insurance. The other half is related to the uninsured. That's the big opportunity that we have as part of healthcare reform. What we can get that down to, it's not clear at this point but certainly, there's a big opportunity to reduce that piece of the bad debt. But again, that's a little less than half of our overall bad debt.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But I guess I'm getting at -- do you have sort of an average price point for the uninsured today? What's that average price point?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, it's significantly higher than it is for the average that we have across the network. And if you look in our 10-Q, you'll see that the volumes associated with patient bill are -- the percentage of volumes associated with patient bill are about half of the revenues associated with patient bill. So it implies that the revenue per requisition is in the range of 2x or more the average revenue per requisition. So it's a very rich requisition, but it carries a significant bad debt attached to it.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And Bob, just to run through the numbers though, is it fair to say that today, that you'd rather have an insured or uninsured patient walk through the door given net collectibility?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, certainly from a collectibility standpoint, an uninsured patient is much more difficult. But yes, I'm not sure that at this point we're prepared to make a call as to what sort of patient we'd rather have walk through the door. We're happy to serve all patients.
Operator: Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First off, I realize this is somewhat of a hypothetical question, but in the event that some of those CRA royalties do become material revenue streams, would you be able to comment on whether you'd let those flow through the P&L? Or would you try and seek to monetize those assets in another way?
Robert A. Hagemann: Look, I think that we would certainly consider monetizing future royalty streams. But yes, I think we'd have to have some better visibility as to what they are before we would do that. But certainly, it's something we would consider.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then Steve, if I could just maybe ask a question on the cost savings plan. If you could maybe bucket the low-hanging fruit as you see them across a couple of major areas: labor, supply chain and then maybe vendor pricing? Just trying to think about out how you see the best opportunities in the next couple of quarters to start realizing those savings.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so I appreciate the question. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, I am personally spending a lot of time on this. And I've shared with some of you that you really need to think about this in 2 categories. Yes, there'll be some shorter-term opportunities that we're going after, and then there will be some harder opportunities that will require investment that will take a longer period of time. And we're looking at both. In the short run, we already mentioned that we're looking at productivity. Specifically, our Voluntary Severance Program that we put together was one of those options for us to look at being more productive where we can do that. So we selectively identified qualified individuals, and that will help us some in the short-term. Second, is we're continuously looking at productivity opportunities because a large portion of our cost structure is our wage bill. And therefore, we are very, very tight on any hire we make and specifically looking for opportunities to drive productivity. Now some of this, as you would expect, happens in our operational teams throughout the company. This is in lab operations, logistics operations, patient service centers. But also, what we are looking at is what we need to do in, let's just say, broadly defined general administration areas. And there will be some opportunities to look at becoming more efficient, if you will, with our cost structure of our overhead going forward. And I also commented to that I spent some time with the procurement team. We did see some opportunities show up in Q2 related to do doing a better job of managing our purchases from outside suppliers. It is the second category to a wage bill that we will see some near-term improvement in that we will see sooner rather than later, and that will continue throughout the period of Invigorate. And then finally, there's opportunities related to a number of improvement efforts that are happening at the grassroots level. There's a number of our regional labs that are working through improvement programs, and I could tell you the support for our employees to contribute to this effort is very, very remarkable. And we're seeing some nice short-term gains from small incremental improvements at the regional level. But if you take those and you add them all up, it's real numbers. And if you take those and extrapolate it throughout entire business, it's substantial. So we will those in the short run. But as I said, there's also some longer-term, re-engineering change management programs that we'll need to invest in, and that will be in the later part of the period of Invigorate.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Last question, if I could, on capital allocation. You guys certainly continue to generate pretty healthy cash flow given a tough volume environment. So can you maybe update us on the board's latest thoughts regarding how that cash will be deployed? Last year you obviously hiked the dividend quite nicely. Is there a walk to the long-term dividend profile that you can give us here, the incremental update?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Absolutely, Bob will give you an update on that.
Robert A. Hagemann: Isaac, look, as we told you, this year our priority is to do some delevering to make sure that we can sustain the credit rating that we have. We believe that, that's critically important to us because at the end of the day, it allows us to minimize the overall cost of capital and ensure that we've got appropriate access in liquidity. So that's the priority now. As we've indicated though, beyond that, once we've gotten a delevering done, we expect to return a majority of the free cash flow to investors, whether it be through dividends or share repurchases. We did a pretty significant increase to the dividend this year. We'd expect that the dividend is going to grow with cash flows and earnings over time. And at this point, we're not prepared to make a commitment as to what the dividend rate will be. I think as we go into the fall and as we figure out what the strategy is going to be, that's going to drive the capital and allocation. So in the near term, no change; but you'll hear more about this in the fall when we come out and share with you some of the longer-term plans for the company.
Operator: Our next question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Steve, I had a follow-up question for you on the sales infrastructure so if -- given the cost-cutting initiatives that you have in place, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the sales force and the patient service center infrastructure. And you talked, for example, about productivity and effectiveness. I'm curious if you can provide a little more color there? That will be helpful.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes. Thanks, Amanda. Well, first of all, everything's on the table, and we are focusing on improving our productivity and reducing cost. And in that respect, we're looking at every area which includes all overhead: overhead on the backs of people in our labs, overhead on the backs of our sales force, overhead in the backs of our patient service centers. So that is critical. We're also looking at improving the workflow of how we take a sample and then eventually collect cash. And Bob will share with you one example of how we feel pretty good about some progress we've made in our billing center. But specifically to the sales force, at the same time -- and I mentioned in my introductory comments, we do need to restore growth. And so we are -- and I am personally looking into how we have gone to market; what type of investments we've made in our sales and marketing efforts, and specifically, how that has contributed to what we have done so far; how we have executed against our plans so far; and what are the right investments for this company going forward to restore growth. I don't have specific comments to make in that regard as I speak. But I'll assure you that we'll make the appropriate investments in our sales force, in our go-to-market organizations to restore growth, which may mean that we'll take some of the freed up spending that we see in Invigorate and reinvest it in portions of our organization to help with restored growth, and that may mean our sales and marketing efforts. But it's too early to share with you specifics on that, but it's being reviewed as I speak with you today.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then just another comment you made earlier is just about missed opportunities when it comes to narrowing networks and women's health. I'm curious if you could provide a little more color about specifically what was missed there and has that or will that change your strategy going forward in those 2 areas? Obviously, you've talked a lot about private payer conversations.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Well, let me take narrowing network. We do have an opportunity with some of our partners, our health plan partners to help them narrow the network, and we're working -- this a great example, working together with the health plans to get more volume and they see an opportunity in their cost structure, and we see an opportunity with our volumes to do that with them. We hoped for some in the second quarter, it did not materialize, but we still see it as a great opportunity going forward. And so that's what my comment was about, is that we hope there's some in the second quarter. And frankly, I think, if we executed it better, we would have got some pick-up in our volumes in the second quarter, but unfortunately, they did not materialize. But as I said, with -- in our view of our sales and marketing efforts, we will look at that and we will deliver more of that in the second half. And I'd like to turn it over to Bob in terms of his comments on women's health.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, women's health is an area that we've seen as an opportunity. It's an area that's continued to grow. But yes, as we've stated earlier, we've had some product gaps, which we filled. And we expected that after having filled those product gaps, we'd be able to start to regrow that business at a faster rate. Again, that hasn't materialized yet, but we continue to see that as an opportunity. We continue to focus on it from both the sales side and the product offering side. And again, it's an area that, while we didn't execute as well than we would have liked in the second quarter, we believe that it will be an opportunity that will drive growth as we go forward and address some of the execution issues.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just had 2 relatively simple questions. First on the kind of sequential slowdown in volumes, are there any takeaways in terms of geography type of testing for this in specialty? Anything that's notable that you saw sequentially?
Robert A. Hagemann: Gary, nothing specific. Obviously, we don't comment on geographies, but as Steve mentioned in his remarks earlier, we saw a slowdown across most of our businesses. So it was relatively widespread. Nothing specific to point to.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And on the growth and revenue per session, can you just remind us a little bit what's the driver behind that and it's specific -- again a specific type of physician specialty outside of primary care that's helping to drive that? Or what do you -- how do you view the sustainability of that trend?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, certainly, physician specialists in the esoteric mix that they order contributes to improvements in revenue per requisition. But it's also the number of tests order per requisition, some of which we may think of as esoteric today, but ultimately are going to be routine, like Vitamin D, for example. The benefit of the growth in Vitamin D has really shown up in revenue per requisition to a large degree. That and other new tests that we introduce, in many cases, show up in revenue per requisition because they're ordered in conjunction with other tests. And that's an area that we believe will continue because we expect that the pace with which new tests are introduced will continue to accelerate over time.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, I may have misspoken. I meant to ask about the number of tests per session or per requisition, but you kind of covered that. And is it fair to say that -- I mean, Vitamin D is still growing, but not nearly I would imagine at its growth rate we saw a year or 2 ago, is that correct?
Robert A. Hagemann: That's a very fair assessment. Yes, as you think about that, it had a really rapid ramp-up. It's become much more of a mature test at this point. And as a result, the growth rate just obviously slows down.
Operator: Our next question is from Sandy Draper with Raymond James.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: All my questions have been asked and answered.
Operator: Our next question is from Derrick -- I'm sorry, Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So we've heard you comment a few times just on disappointing execution in the second quarter and in a number of areas. And I guess, my question, Steve, is just as you think about how you are setting expectations for the team and attempt to increase the accountability, can you just talk about some of the process changes you're making in running the company? And just how you sort of are managing that execution question as you move forward?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, sure. First of all, in this review of businesses and operations, clearly, we need to look at do we have the right structure to execute any strategy we have in place. And we are looking at that. And then second is, I've been asked this before, clearly, you need to have the right leadership team in place to restore growth and improve our shareholder returns. And as everyone would expect, that's being considered as well. But specific to the approach, and I mentioned in my Invigorate comments, what I am bringing into the company is a disciplined structure and rigorous approach to deployment of strategy. And I gave the example of Invigorate, but I'll also share with you that will be my approach for restoring growth as well. So strategy is important, but it's also very important and I would argue more important to work on the deployment. And in my past experiences, what I will do going forward, and I'll share this in the fall, is we'll have a very structured rigorous deployment of each of the strategic programs we put in place, some of which will be around productivity gains and improving our cost structure going forward, but also will be equally put in place related to restoring growth. And related to that is once we agree what we're going to do, then we need to make sure we have the right proper plan that's properly resourced. So with that rigor, with that discipline and with that structure, I'm insisting once we agree to do something, that we have the resources and then those resources are held accountable to deliver. So that is my philosophy in general, and I gave Invigorate as an example of that, but it will extend itself to everything we do in the company going forward.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And then if I could just ask you, you have talked about the $40 million associated with early retirements. I'm curious just to know on the senior management team, have there been any decisions made about who will take early retirement? And is that something that has been decided yet?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: No, we're not prepared to share anything related to specific individuals. What I'll share with you is the participation in the program is broad throughout the organization. And I -- Bob, would you like to share any insight into the people that opted into the program and how that ties into the savings?
Robert A. Hagemann: There's not a lot specifically, Steve. It's a very broad-based program. It's covering just about every part of the organization, although I would tell you that we very thoughtfully designed the program. There were certain parts of the organization, certain employees that we felt were critical that were not offered the plan, and we maintain the ability to not accept certain people as well, so that we could manage any potential adverse impact that the program would have. And then lastly, we maintained the ability to determine one person would actually lead the workforce. So we've been able to ourselves, I think, manage it pretty effectively, but it's a broad-based program.
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, and just adding to that, we surgically looked at specific work areas and thought forward in terms of the skill mix of some of those work areas. So we used it as an opportunity to think about the workforce in general. So yes, some people will leave from this program, but also we saw it as an opportunity to affect our wage bill in specific areas where we have a skill mix going on with our operations. So it is a very comprehensive, robust program that will help reduce some costs; but at the same time, help improve our productivity as well.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's great. And just one last thing to clarify a comment Bob made in response to the royalty portfolio from Celera. Bob, you said you need better visibility on the revenue opportunity, I think, is sort of the comment. But does that mean that you need those products to be commercialized in the market? I'm just trying to understand sort of at what point you would seriously consider monetizing the royalty?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, it's a interesting question. And I don't want to be too specific at this point because it is premature to gauge what the actual opportunity will be, not only from the Merck drugs, but the other drugs that Celera has rights to as well. But I think for us to get the appropriate value for those drugs and those assets and those royalties, we have to have a pretty good view as to what they'll realize for us.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Well, I think it's an interesting situation nonetheless, so nice position for you to be in.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Bob, I was just surprised the deleveraging wasn't more material in the quarter. I thought that was a bigger part of the strategy going forward. Are you kind of happy with the outstanding debt levels currently?
Robert A. Hagemann: Bob, it's pretty much as we had planned. As you know, we generate the majority of our free cash flow in the back half of the year, and the delevering is really following the way the cash flows come in. So this is pretty consistent with what we had anticipated.
Operator: Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And I apologize for earlier. That was directed at a salesperson, clearly not at Quest. I just had a quick follow-on question around acquisition opportunities and just around hospital outreach, labs and what you're seeing in the marketplace and how things have gone with your existing relationship, and if you see opportunities going forward?
Stephen H. Rusckowski: Sure, appreciate that. Well, first of all, as I said in my opening comments, we don't anticipate any large acquisitions. But we will consider what we call tuck-in acquisitions that we could fold into operations that could be reasonably accretive in the short term. That would include what we could do on a regional level. And also I made some comments about what hospital systems we're looking at and integrated delivery systems we're looking at in terms of where they add value, what's strategic and what they need to rely on others to do, and there might be some opportunities for us on that. So we are looking at all of that and there are some opportunities.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Lisa, I would to add to this. We think about hospitals and the opportunity to work with them to grow our business. Certainly, there's the opportunity to acquire their outreach business. There's still a big opportunity to gain additional reference testing from them. We look to manage some hospital laboratories. And in selective cases, we've looked at joint venture in certain markets where it makes sense. So we continue to think about multiple ways to work with hospitals to grow our business and help them compete effectively as well.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and the question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of the call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. Before we get started, I'd like to say a few words about our leadership transition. Last week, we announced that Steve Rusckowski will become the President and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics effective May 1. Also, Dr. Dan Stanzione, currently our leading independent Director, will become non-executive Chairman at that time. We are pleased to have someone of Steve's caliber join and lead Quest Diagnostics. Steve is a strong leader with a proven track record of success. His experience and expertise will benefit the company as it looks to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. I know that all of you are anxious to hear about Steve and his plans for the company. However, please hold your questions until after he arrives. Now to the results. We had a very solid first quarter. Our 6.3% increase in revenue was driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. We generated a 7% increase in earnings per share. We increased guidance for adjusted EPS to between $4.45 and $4.60. We saw strong growth in esoteric and gene-based testing as a result of our focus on cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. In addition, we saw improved growth in routine testing. We also are making good progress in our previously announced $500 million cost reduction initiative aimed at improving operational efficiency. Let me briefly comment on long-term and short-term market trends. The long-term fundamentals for our business remain strong. The population is growing and aging, prevalence of chronic conditions is on the rise, early detection and wellness are increasing in importance, the pace of medical innovation is accelerating and we are seeing much greater engagement by payers, employers and patients in improving health outcomes and reducing costs. However, in the short-term, the current market environment continues to be challenging. Published data indicates physician office visits have been weak in spite of mild weather. Reimbursement pressure from government and other payers continues. Against this backdrop, we continue to execute our growth plans and while we have made good progress, we have more to do. As we have said before, our growth strategy is based on 3 factors: One, driving innovative new tests and service to improving sales performance and towards strengthening our relationships with health plans and other payers. Demand for esoteric and gene-based testing continued to grow faster than routine testing. In the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing grew 20%. Volume for SureSwab gynecological testing was up more than 50% and ImmunoCAP allergy testing was up more than 10%. Vitamin D testing also continued to grow. Anatomic Pathology Testing continues to be affected by physician in sourcing. However, the impact on revenues has continued to moderate. There have been recent developments which we believe may lessen the impact and potentially reverse this trend over time. Last week, Health Affairs published a study on physicians who refer biopsies to pathology labs in which they have a financial interest. The study found these physicians billed Medicare for 72% more evaluations, but find fewer cancers. This study highlights the adverse impact of unnecessary procedures on patients and the need for Congress to end the loophole in the Stark legislation that currently allows it. In addition, we are encouraged to see health plans taking actions, including changing reimbursement policies related to in-office testing. In science and innovation, we continue to focus on bringing innovative tests to market that will improve patient care and help health lower healthcare costs. Last week, the FDA cleared out new test for C. Diff, a common and dangerous hospital-acquired infection. This test uses proprietary technique to deliver faster results for hospitals and clinical labs. Also last month, we launched the first molecular test to help physicians detect rejection in kidney transplant patients weeks before conventional tests. Our renal transplant monitoring test enables doctors to adjust therapy based on each individual's genetic makeup. It has the potential to improve patient care, while helping to reduce the significant cost of failed kidney transplants. This test is the latest example of how we are driving personalized medicine. We are the only major laboratory to have these unique end-to-end capabilities, from biomarker discovery to laboratory developed tests at LDTs to FDA-cleared IVD test kits. These capabilities are attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and resulting in new companion diagnostics and new business. We are seeing greater traction in our sales efforts. The sales organization has made gains in important focus areas. We have returned to growth in women's health testing and are seeing continued strong growth in prescription drug monitoring. Additionally, health plans and employers continue to focus on reducing out-of-network spending and work that's going to high-cost providers. Some of these actions include: Implementing stronger policies that benefit lower-cost in network providers like us; others include expanding educational outreach to employers and employees to emphasize the importance of using lower-cost in-network providers. Regarding our cost structure, we are committed to reduce it by $500 million over a 3-year period and we are on track.  Now, Bob will provide analysis of our performance and then we will take your questions. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. As noted by Surya, revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, reflecting strong growth of 6.3%. And adjusted earnings per share was $1.07 compared to $1 in the prior year, a 7% increase. The earnings improvement is principally driven by top-line growth. Adjusted EPS for the quarter excludes $0.05 per share associated with restructuring and integration costs and $0.03 associated with the CEO transition. Adjusted EPS from last year's first quarter excludes items totaling $1.33 per share, associated with the impact of the Medi-Cal charge, severe weather and restructuring and transaction costs. These items are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release. Consolidated revenue growth was driven by the acquisitions of Athena, Celera and SED, which contributed 3.2% to growth in the quarter. The favorable impact from weather about 2%, and about 1% growth in the underlying business. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew 6.4% in the quarter with acquisitions contributing 2.8% growth and favorable weather comparisons contributing about 2%. Volume in the quarter grew 3.4% from the prior year. We estimate the impact of weather helped the year-over-year comparisons by about 2%. Adjusting for the favorable impact of weather and the contribution from acquisitions, underlying volume growth was almost 1%. This continues the positive trend which began in the fourth quarter of last year. The market, in terms of estimated physician office visits, continues to be soft. In the quarter, the published data reflects about a 2% decline compared to the prior year. While our most recent improvement in volume is encouraging, the year-over-year comparisons are favorably impacted by weather and as such, we continue to believe it is still too early to conclude the market has turned the corner. Drugs of Abuse Testing volume has continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with the growth of last quarter. Revenue per requisition was 2.9% above the prior year with the improvement principally due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. Note; the impact on revenue per requisition, associated with the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, will anniversary next quarter. Revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and Healthcare IT grew about 6% in the quarter, driven by the products business acquired as part of the Celera acquisition. Adjusted operating income, as a percentage of revenues, was 16.5% compared to 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling $20 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by about 1 percentage point from the most recent quarter. Both reported and adjusted operating income percentages were reduced by about 50 basis points due to costs associated with a legal settlement and costs associated with changes in assets held in deferred compensation points. In last year's first quarter, the Medi-Cal charge and other special items, together totaling $270 million, significantly reduced reported operating income. Last July, we announced a multi-year initiative, the goal of which is to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of 2014. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect to deliver about 20% of the $500 million goal by the end of this year with the remainder in 2013 and 2014. While it is still early in the year, we are on track to meet our 2012 targets. As we've previously shared, common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases, increased use of automation and technology and centralizing and selective outsourcing. The next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure. We are fully committed to realizing the planned benefits from this program which will not only make our company more efficient, but also serve as a platform for accelerated growth. Currently, we continue to produce industry-leading performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, which is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with unmet deductibles and co-pays was 4.2% in the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. DSOs were 44 days compared to 45 days last quarter. Cash from operations, which is generally lowest in the first quarter, was $161 million and is comparable to the prior-year level. Capital expenditures were $30 million in the quarter compared to $39 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 847,000 common shares at an average price of $59, for a total of $50 million. We also reduced our outstanding debt by $105 million in connection with our stated objective to delever by $500 million to $700 million this year. Turning to 2012 guidance. We now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenue to grow between 2% and 2.5%; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $225 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.45 and $4.60 compared to previous guidance of $4.40 to $4.55.  Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thanks, Bob. In summary, we had a very solid quarter. We are making progress in a number of areas to drive growth and reduce our costs. We have named a new Chief Executive Officer for Quest Diagnostics, Steve Rusckowski, with a proven track record. I will be here through April 30 to ensure a smooth transition. Finally, I want to say how proud I am of Quest Diagnostics and my 42,000 colleagues in what they have accomplished so far and what they will accomplish in the future. Quest Diagnostics is strong financially, medically and technologically. It's a unique company with a very bright future. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Adam Feinstein of Barclays.
Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just, maybe just get you to talk a little bit more about the margin outlook. I know you guys have been talking about the 18% and clearly more focused on managing costs and everything here. But maybe just go through the thoughts in a little bit more detail on the margin outlook and the ultimate drivers.
Robert A. Hagemann: Adam, as generally the first quarter is the lowest margin percentage of the year, bad debt tends to be the highest as a result of the higher patient responsibility for co-pays and deductibles. The volumes tend to be softer than the latter quarters. And as we saw last year, margins continued to improve as we went through the year. We're expecting the same thing this year. And if you look at the adjusted margins, they did expand from a year ago on what's relatively modest underlying organic growth. I think we've mentioned in the past that generally we need about 2% organic growth in order to hold margins and offset the inflation that we've got to the cost base and that this year the margin expansion that we are expecting, given that we're expecting pretty modest organic growth, is really coming from the cost reduction program. And as we progress through the year, we expect to see more benefits from that and we also expect that we'll continue to expand the margins as the year progresses. Remember too, as I pointed out in the script, margins, the adjusted margins were depressed by about 50 basis points or so this quarter because of a legal settlement and because of the adjustment assets in deferred compensation plans.
Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And just maybe a quick follow-up if I may here. So maybe just a quick update just in terms of the CEO transition process. I guess just thoughts in terms of just how the process will take place and what, I guess, from the outside looking in, what does the transition process really entail? So any high-level thoughts?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Sure, Adam. First of all, Steve Rusckowski is a veteran of healthcare industry and he is not new to what is important for patients and for payers and also for providers. So we are really excited to have him lead this company. I have had a number of discussions with him. He is -- we are helping him to get some material, as much as he can read, before he comes to the company. He still has to finish his jobs, but I am very pleased with his knowledge and also his engagement so far. So I think the transition is going to go very smoothly, and I will be here until April 30, the last day, and he will join on May 1, the first day of his, rest of his career.
Operator: Our next question is from Dane Leone from Macquarie.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: So my question, my first question here is on the organic volume growth, you mentioned that you stripped out weather. I was curious, did you have an extra day in the quarter from the leap year? And if so, what was the effect on volume growth?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's a question a few people have asked, and maybe we should have been proactive in addressing it. But the answer is no. If you look at the way the New Year's holiday fell, this year the New Year's holiday fell in January, whereas the prior year, it actually fell on December 31 and didn't impact the quarter. So that's really what's offsetting the benefit of leap year this year.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: But wasn't --
Kathleen Valentine: If you recall, I mean, last year, we did call out that the first quarter in 2011, we did have the benefit of an extra day as a result of how the New Year's holiday had fallen.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Right, but I thought the, then Easter, Good Friday fall outside of -- in April versus March last year, is that right?
Robert A. Hagemann: I think they were both in April.
Kathleen Valentine: Yes.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay. On the guidance for the year, could you maybe parse out the operating assumption variation for the EPS, because looking at the low-end of revenue guidance at 2% around an 18% operating margin and not including any capital deployment for debt paydowns over the remainder of the year for stock repurchases, it's a little difficult to get, I guess, below the high-end of your EPS guidance. You come out around $4.60 so yes, maybe just a little bit more color on some of the variation and assumptions for sales growth and operating line.
Robert A. Hagemann: As you can imagine, Dane, whatever model you're using is pretty sensitive to just minor changes in revenue or just a few basis points in operating income. And we have provided a range for revenue. We've indicated approximately 18% in operating income, which means that it could be slightly below that at the low-end of the range. And as you noted, we're not necessarily expecting the weighted average shares outstanding to be significantly different from last year. We are doing some share repurchases this year, but a little more modest than we would otherwise, because of the delevering that's going on.
Operator: Next question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just have a question as we think about your guidance going forward on revenue. So if we think now about revenue in the second to fourth quarter, we're now going to be modeling 1% to 1.5% in order to get within your guidance range. Can you maybe just talk about your expectations around it's slowing down? Is it just that you don’t expect utilization to continue where it is? Or is it something else that we should be thinking about?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, Lisa, as you think about our outlook for the back half of the year, there's really nothing fundamentally that's changed there. As you know, we're going to have the acquisitions essentially anniversaried in the second quarter. And when you look at the underlying organic growth adjusted for weather and all the noise that's in there, it was around 1% or so this quarter. We're expecting that over the course of the rest of the year. As you look out at physician office visits and you see how they performed this quarter, it indicates that the market continues to be soft. So we're not necessarily expecting the market to pick up significantly as the year progresses. We're expecting it to remain soft, and that's what's built into our guidance at this point.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then secondly, can you maybe just talk about market pricing in general? There's been a lot of comments out on our side and in the market where people have been concerned about what pricing looks like and what it's going to look like going forward. Can you just add any comments as to what you're seeing right now?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, I think it's no surprise that we continue to see pressure on reimbursement. We expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. And that's frankly one of the motivations behind us reducing costs and launching the program that we did. But despite that, we are indicating that we expect margins can expand this year.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Congratulations again on the completion of the CEO succession process. Surya, just going back to the utilization comments and physician office visits remaining weak. In your prepared remarks, you made a comment about routine testing improving. Just wondering what type of information and analytics you guys have that validates this, what's driving it? And I don't know if you can add any more color on the utilization improving?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, I can tell you that there is no one-to-one correlation about physician office visits and laboratory testing. But having said that, there's 100 million people in the United States suffer from chronic disease and 40 million people are suffering from more than 3. And as you said, we invested quite a bit of time and money in training and creating an effective sales force. And what we are seeing that we are gaining in ground in women's health and some routine testing that goes along with esoteric testings and so all parts of our business are growing, and that's actually an early indicator of the investment we have put in sales and marketing.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Do you think the improvement that you've seen in women's health and the like is coming from the marketing expanding or market share gains?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Again, it's a little too early to say, but my feeling is that usually we consider diagnostic testing is a very safe industry unlike Pharma and devices where things can go wrong. This is the safe investment for the investor, because it's very steady. So the market need to grow 4% to 6% a year, 2% to 3% in price and 2% to 3% in volume, but over the last couple of years, my feeling is and what we see is falling flat of 1%. So in some areas, in new areas, expanding areas like esoteric and gene-based testing, I think the -- we are developing market, and market is growing in some areas we are -- started to gain some market share.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. And then Bob, I just wanted to clarify the comment to Dane's question about no extra day for leap year. Is that because leap year -- New Year's fell on Sunday, so was Monday a day off for testing?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct. That's when the holiday was celebrated. It was in January whereas in the prior year, the holiday was actually celebrated in December.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then maybe could you guys just expand a little bit on the commercial pricing environment? Do you have any major contracts coming up? And if so, could we get an update on that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, there are no national contracts that are up this year. We do have one up in 2013. And we always have contracts, smaller contracts coming up in any given year. But as I said, none of the big national ones are up for renewal. With that said, we're always having conversations with the plans, regardless of whether or not contracts are up. And as I said earlier, I expect that reimbursement will continue to be under pressure, particularly from the health plans. But on the flip side, I think we're making more progress in working with the health plans in driving more work to us to lower-cost in-network providers like ourselves. So hopefully that will be one of the ways that we're able to mitigate some of the continued price pressure, along with what we're doing on the cost side.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That makes a lot of sense. And then could you tell us which contract comes up in 2013, Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: The CIGNA contract is up in '13.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: In terms of -- as we think about the organic revenue growth, I appreciate your sort of conservative view given one quarter in the bank here. But just to make sure I understand the numbers, Bob, you're talking about a little bit under or around 1%, I guess, adjusted organic volume growth. And it seems like maybe the deals added, acquisitions added a little over 2% to your revenue per requisition so maybe without the deals, you're just under 1% as well. Is that fair?
Robert A. Hagemann: The acquisitions did add in excess of 2% to revenue per requisition, driving the vast majority of the increase there.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, so your adjusted or your organic revenue growth, adjusted for weather and whatnot, is probably around 1.5%, is that a fair rough range?
Robert A. Hagemann: You're not far off, yes.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then, could you give us a little bit more on the cost-cutting program? I mean, you've outlined some higher-level initiatives, but can you give us a little bit more tangible examples of the things you did in the quarter that you're working on right now, so we sort of understand what's going on the ground, if you will?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and Tom, I detailed all of these last quarter. But yes, as a reminder, some of the things that we're working on certainly on the client support side, which include customer service and billing include the leveraging technology to eliminate manual work. We're implementing more self-service for customers, allowing them to supply insurance information, make payments online, check bill status, get test results which, at the end of the day, the more that can be done online, the more efficient it is for us because we're not handling all of those calls. On the procurement and supply chain side, we talked about further consolidating suppliers, rationalizing SKUs. Examples that we gave there were reducing the number of choices for gloves, specimen bags, labels, urine collection cups, et cetera. All of those things are in process at this point. On the SG&A side, we talked about flattening the organization structure, simplifying some management processes and beginning to centralize certain activities and consider outsourcing others. And then on the IT side, we talked about moving our connectivity solutions to ones that will not require hardware that we'll need to service in the field, it makes the installation more efficient and it makes the cost of servicing that connectivity a lot less expensive over time. And then we talked about things that obviously are not yet impacting this quarter like the labs and specimen acquisition as we start to look at the lab footprint capacity utilization, automation being further leveraged in the labs and the like.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then just one clarification, Bob, if I could. You had mentioned a couple of other unusual items in the quarter, I guess a change in the assets in the deferred comp plan and another. Can you just highlight that again to make sure we got that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Sure. One was legal settlement that cost us about $5 million and that impacted margins. And then we've talked about this in the past as well, but not recently, and that is the assets in our supplemental deferred compensation plan. The gains and losses on those show up below the line in Other Income Expense. And to the degree it's a gain, that gain shows up below the line, but the offsetting charge shows up above that line as an increase to compensation cost. It's a quirk in the way the accounting works. And given that the market had a very strong return in the first quarter, it really accentuated that in our results this quarter.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, so that nets each other out. So you're just highlighting that second one so we can get a better understanding of the actual margin trends.
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And that legal settlement though, I guess, is an unusual item that would add to your operating profit and your EPS if we wanted to exclude that, is that right?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct, if you want it to. Unfortunately, sometimes those do happen and we decided that it was not unusual enough to call out for purposes of adjusted EPS.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, so those 2 items together are like between $0.01 and $0.02?
Robert A. Hagemann: Actually, a little more than that, it's about $10 million in total or about 50 basis points. So closer to $0.04...
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Well that's to the margin, right? But the --
Robert A. Hagemann: The one item is about $0.02.
Operator: All right, the next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wanted to go back one last time to the organic growth trends. On the clinical lab testing side, work's sort of shaken out to 1.6, you said volume up about 1%. Pricing roughly up 50 bps. And you mentioned sort of the comping out of some of the deals, so I guess as we think of the model going forward, is that sort of a level that we should be considering when we think of kind of the pricing growth for the rest of the year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Ralph, as you know, we don't give guidance for the components of revenue growth or the revenue per acquisition or volume. But yes, implied in our guidance for the remainder of the year is about 1% organic revenue growth.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, can you give us what your, what the Anatomic Pathology volume and/or revenue growth was for the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: We don't break that out specifically on a quarterly basis but yes, as you heard in the prepared remarks, it did continue to be under pressure. It was below the prior year, but that impact is starting to moderate. So it's not as severe as it was.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just going back to Surya's comments on the health plans changing policies around that. Can you give us any more color there? I mean is that, is it something that's starting in 2012 or what's the magnitude, is it one plan, is it multitude of plans? Where are we there?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well you know, Ralph, first of all, any changes, that will take some time. But we are very encouraged because the Health Affairs article really show something so critical that the people who have a financial interest, they're billing Medicare more, 72%, and they're finding less cancers. But apart from that, there are lots of effects on patients. So obviously, the plans are very focused on these things. Some plans are denying reimbursement. Some plans are reducing reimbursement. And some plans are asking the laboratory to be clear and approved or CAP accredited. So these are all good things for the patients and good thing for AP business, and we are very encouraged. I for one know that you cannot do cancer testing without anatomic pathology. And this is not going to be long before there is potential that this trend will be reversed.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Ralph, it is multiple health plans that are implementing these changes and hopefully now with the health affairs report being out, it will prompt others to consider changes. And frankly, I think those changes have been contributing to the moderation of the insourcing.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And any more details, I mean, what are they actually saying? Are they saying it can't be done? Are they monitoring? Or is there preauthorization or what exactly is happening?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Some of the [indiscernible] are particularly saying that they will not accept results from the labs which are not CAP accredited.
Kathleen Valentine: Ralph, what they're doing is they're implementing policies. So they're notifying their providers of policies and as we alluded, in some cases the actions that, and the policies that the health plan has implemented is, they notify physicians that they'll be denying reimbursement for this discrete range of CPT codes, pathology testing CPT codes when they're performed, when the claim is submitted from a physician office setting.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just my last one, our understanding is that Aetna recently made Genzyme Genetics out-of-network. Do you guys have a sense at all the potential benefit to you and maybe remind us of your capabilities for those specific tests?
Robert A. Hagemann: Certainly, yes, if their network is narrowed, that's going to be a benefit for us. And there is nothing that Genzyme's doing that we can't offer today and don't offer.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Do you guys have any sense of size?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, I don't think that we would start to cull out specific opportunities from other competitors.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Bonello of RBC Capital Markets.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So before I have a follow-up question, I want to clarify a number that you said. I thought you said that the SureSwab growth was 50, 5-0 percent in the quarter. Is -- did I get that right?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, you did.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And should I think of that as the rate at which trichomonas volume is growing? Or is that really reflective of a change in the actual collection device, but not the underlying test volume?
Robert A. Hagemann: Bill, you have to understand that SureSwab was introduced just recently last year. So we're operating off a relatively small base. But the point is yes, it's a test that's getting some good traction here.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on just back on the operating margin question and particularly on the SG&A. So it's helpful to get the 50 basis point adjustment that you talked about with the legal settlement and the asset adjustment. I assume the legal piece was all in SG&A, but was the asset kind of split between cost of services and G&A?
Robert A. Hagemann: The 2 items that we talked about impacted SG&A in cost of sales almost equally, I would say, Bill.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so if even with that stripped out and even with sort of the bad debt, if we back that out, it seems like SG&A expense is still growing faster than revenue growth, which in this time of sort of cost savings initiatives is a little bit curious, and I was just wondering if you can talk a bit about maybe what's driving that growth and at what point we might see the same kind of leverage or more leverage on SG&A like we've been seeing on gross margin?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, well, one of the things you need to consider is the impact of the acquisitions that we did. And I think I was mentioning this several times last year. The Athena and Celera acquisitions had a very positive impact to cost of sales, but increased the SG&A percentage just because of the businesses and the way that they operate. And you're going to see that SG&A impact as well as that cost of sales impact anniversary next quarter. But that was driving changes in both of those metrics.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on the well, never mind, I was going to ask can you try and take another crack again at pricing, but I think you -- well, let me ask it a different way. You're not going to give a sort of percent increase or project where revenue per requisition is going to go. But I guess I'm having a hard time discerning from your comments whether as we look forward, if we strip out Medicare, because we all know Medicare's a big challenge in 2013. But if we strip that out, whether the pricing environment on the commercial side you're actually expecting to get worse over the next 6 to 18 months? Or are you just commenting on what has sort of what has sort of always been a difficult pricing environment?
Robert A. Hagemann: Bill, as I think about it, it's a very difficult pricing environment today. I don't expect that to abate and in fact, as I've listened to other healthcare providers yes, I'm consistently hearing the same thing, that reimbursement pressure has ratcheted up and most expected to stay something that is under significant pressure as we go forward. Employers are looking for ways to reduce costs, health costs, healthcare costs are a significant piece of that. They're, in turn, putting pressure on their payers who are in turn putting pressure on providers. And we don't see that abating anytime soon.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so I promise this is the last question, but just as part of that, if we go back to the middle of 2010, you actually had a considerable step down in revenue per requisition because of recontracting and whatnot. I mean is there something going on where we need to be worried about that kind of a movement again?
Robert A. Hagemann: Bill, again, I would tell you that yes, we continue to see pressure. We're going to do what we think is appropriate to maintain access here, provide competitive pricing. And I'm not going to get into specifics about what we may or may not do on a particular contract, though.
Kathleen Valentine: And it also points out...
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I asked one in different ways.
Kathleen Valentine: Bill, one other comment is when you look at going back to 2010, if you recall, what also impacted our revenue per rec was the change in business mix, that's when we saw kind of the significant step down in anatomic pathology revenues, which carries a higher revenue per requisition and that decline put pressure on revenue per requisition and we also saw a step-up in drugs of abuse testing. So you had some business mix impacting revenue per rec trends back then.
Operator: Next question is from Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just have a couple of things here. The first, just going to back to the organic growth that's embedded in, I guess, Q2 throughout the remainder of the year. Bob, I think you said 1%. So I just want to clarify, we can do the math, it's implied at around 1%. Are you including S.E.D. in that number? Can you just clarify what you're saying here?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, remember, S.E.D. obviously is included in that number, but it's relatively small. We're talking $20 million to $25 million in revenue for S.E.D. So when I talk about organic revenue growth, with or without S.E.D., it's still about 1%.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, all right. I just wanted to make double sure what you're saying there. All right, and then the next question, I guess, is just a couple of strategic ones for you. The first is I want to just get a quick update on how you're thinking about the market relative to patient service center, access points versus embedded client phlebotomists in the office. And just if there's any notable change relative to what you need to be doing in certain markets relative to the latter, which I'm assuming is, can be a little bit more costly for you to get that kind of access.
Robert A. Hagemann: Darren, I would tell you that there's no specific trend or development that we're seeing there. In each case, we evaluate what's required market-by-market and respond to that accordingly.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and then the other question I have is just relative to your hospital strategy. We obviously saw you enter somewhat of a new market with S.E.D. and that seemed to be a logical way by buying a good hospital lab network. How is your hospital strategy evolving? Should we be expecting more joint venturing? Is there anything that you can say just updating us on the developments there, certainly against the trend that we're all seeing of physician employment?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well certainly, as we think about hospitals, they're going to continue to be important customers for us. And hospitals are going through some significant changes themselves. In many cases, they're evaluating whether or not they want to continue to be in the lab business and as we saw with S.E.D., they concluded that, that was something that was not strategic to them and that it's better left to someone that's got more experience in that area, particularly given the fact that as a hospital, I think they saw the reimbursement pressure coming, knowing that some of the pricing differentials that exist today may not exist in the future. And as such, it will be very difficult for them to maintain their margins given that their cost structure was higher than ours. I'm hopeful that we'll see more of that as we go forward. There are cases, as you know, where we do have joint ventures in certain markets. I would tell you that joint ventures are not necessarily a strategy. Again, it's something that's driven by the circumstances in that marketplace, the partner that you're talking to. But I do think that there are opportunities for us to work more closely with hospitals, whether it be lab management agreements, acquiring their outreach business, potentially joint venturing with them. But each market is a little different, each hospital thinks about the way they're going to execute their strategy a little differently. And I think we need to be flexible in each of those cases and will be. But rest assured that the hospital market is important to us, and we expect to continue growing there. A lot of our growth actually on the esoteric testing business is coming from sales to hospitals.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great, and then just to clarify what you've said, Bob, is it safe to say that your development pipeline, your acquisition pipeline does now include more hospital outreach lab deals?
Robert A. Hagemann: It always has, yes, whether or not includes -- it's tough to say whether or not it includes more. It's a pretty dynamic pipeline all the time. But yes, I'm hopeful that we'll see more of those opportunities. As you know, they're -- I think of them as fold-ins, we get to take a book of business, fold it into our existing infrastructure; we can do that very well. You tend to get good incremental margins on those types of things and effectively further strengthen the distribution network that you've got. So certainly to the degree that they're available, we will look at them. At this point though, I wouldn't tell you that there's a lot of them in the pipeline or any more than we would typically have. But hopefully, we'll see more as we go forward.
Operator: Next question is from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Surya, best wishes and I can't believe it's been 10 years.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: It did go by quickly. I have a couple of follow-up questions at this point. First of all on the pricing environment, just to get a better understanding of how commercial plans think about pricing, when we think about Medicare that's going to be down next year, does that automatically impact commercial rates, i.e., what percent of your commercial book prices off the Medicare benchmark?
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky, very little of our business automatically adjusts with, very little of our commercial business automatically adjusts with changes in the Medicare fee schedule. As you know, though, it's used as a reference point in negotiating contracts. So that doesn't necessarily help us when we see Medicare reimbursement reduced, but it doesn't necessarily automatically trigger a lot of changes in our commercial contracts.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, so just to clarify, it's not as if it's priced off Medicare plus or Medicare minus?
Robert A. Hagemann: Not as a floating amount, no.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, and then secondly, on the cost cutting initiative. I know that you've provided us a lot of detail. But just so to help us in how we think about modeling going forward, what percent should we allocate to cost of goods versus SG&A this year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and Ricky, look, we've never gotten into the business of giving guidance for cost of sales and SG&A. We operate the business, then manage the operating margin. And in some cases, we spend in one area to further reduce costs in another area. But what you should expect is that both the cost of sales line and the SG&A line over time will be favorably impacted they what we're doing here.
Operator: The next question is Amanda Murphy of William Blair.
Sylvia Chao: It's actually Sylvia here for Amanda today. Just have a couple of quick follow-ups. So just wonder, is it a possibility or is it a part of your consideration that you would kind of do an early renewal with the larger national contract and take the heat this year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, I think we have to be responsive to what our customers are looking for, and we're always having dialogues with them and I wouldn't rule anything out in that regard. But I'm not going to specifically comment on it.
Sylvia Chao: Great, okay. So if there is any impact, it's not baked in yet the 2012 guidance?
Robert A. Hagemann: Anything that we are aware of or that we're contemplating is built into our guidance this year.
Sylvia Chao: Okay, got you. And just as a follow-up on the acquisitions. So it looks like it was becoming stronger than expected. What drove the outperformance on that segment specifically?
Robert A. Hagemann: When you say it performed better than expected...
Sylvia Chao: Just on the revenue per rec on its volume side?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well again, we tried to break out a lot of this in the prepared remarks. The acquisitions now include the benefit of S.E.D., which we did not have in previous quarters. And as you saw, both Celera and Athena were contributing in excess of 2% previously. So that's really the difference now is that we have S.E.D. in the results. And then the other thing that we pointed out was the benefit of weather in the year-over-year comparisons.
Sylvia Chao: Okay, and could you remind us if those newer acquisitions had been consolidated into Quest in our contracts?
Robert A. Hagemann: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
Sylvia Chao: I'm sorry, if -- could you remind us if those acquisitions such as S.E.D. in our contract, have they been consolidated into Quest?
Robert A. Hagemann: S.E.D. certainly will be, yes.
Operator: All right. The next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.
Unknown Analyst: It's actually Justin for Isaac. First on the CapEx guidance. You guys lowered it slowly. Could you maybe talk to what was pushed out or pulled out of that at all?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, nothing specific. We looked at the level of spending in the first quarter and revisited the plans that we have for the remainder of the year. And all of the programs that we planned we're continuing to move forward with. It looks like some of them, though, will just get started a little later. But it will have no impact on what we expect in terms of the cost-reduction program.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then looking at the cost-reduction program, you guys said about 20% of it this year. Have you talked about the pacing at all, how you expect that to come through the back half of this year?
Robert A. Hagemann: We have not, and that 20% is really a run rate as we exit the year, that's how we've talked about the $500 million that -- it'll be a run rate as we exit 2014. So as you'd expect, it ramps up this year. And it ramps up more slowly than it will in '13 and '14, and '13 and '14 is really where we start to see the more significant benefits from that.
Unknown Analyst: And then lastly, looking at volumes, assuming they stay at the rough organic level that they're at now, I mean how do you guys look at the ability to extend operating margins in the out years, combining that with the $500 million reduction program?
Robert A. Hagemann: As we've indicated earlier, generally we think about needing 2% organic revenue growth for us to be able to hold margins and offset the inflationary cost that we have in our cost structure. Half of that being salaries, wages and benefits which generally going up around 3% a year. And the expansion that we're expecting now is really coming from the cost-reduction and hopefully as we get into the out years and we start to see some pickup in the market, we can see further expansion and the acceleration at that point. But the cost-reduction program will allow us to expand margins in this sort of tough market that we're in right now. And that's essentially what you see in the guidance that we put out there for 2012.
Operator: All right. Our next question is from Gary Taylor of Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple, and both have been touched on. So just on the CapEx, Bob, you've described as a relatively small change, I guess it's almost a 10% reduction but your comment is basically that's entirely related to just timing of spend?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And on the G&A, I guess I've been trying to follow, I'm maybe a little confused about maybe some references to first quarter of '11, when you were explaining some of the spend. So maybe the way I'd like to ask the G&A, how should we be thinking about G&A on a dollar sequential basis into the 2Q?
Robert A. Hagemann: Gary, I -- we don't give that kind of guidance at this point. And yes, as I told you, we don't give it in terms of dollars or percentages for cost of sales or SG&A. And yes, I'd encourage you to think about it more as margins. As I said earlier, often some levers that we're pulling impact cost of sales or SG&A, but we see benefits show up in the other line.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. So just to clarify then, I kind of got lost. There was a comment where you mentioned a legal and an asset impact on the G&A line. Is there something in the 1Q G&A line that you're calling out as nonrecurring that...
Robert A. Hagemann: There's probably about $5 million in each the cost of sales line and the SG&A line this quarter that are somewhat unusual, but not big enough for us to include in the adjusted results.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, and then just quickly, I just want to point out maybe for Kathleen. When I click on the PowerPoint presentation, it's only coming out as a one-pager instead of a typical 12 or 13 and a couple of other people have mentioned that to me. So...
Kathleen Valentine: Okay, thank you, I'll look at that. Yes --
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Good thing to look at.
Kathleen Valentine: It is more than 1 page. Although maybe not 12, but --
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'm sure, okay.
Robert A. Hagemann: It shows what, the disclaimer?
Kathleen Valentine: It probably is. I'll take that. Thanks, Gary, for pointing that out.
Operator: All right, next question is from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I think you might have said it, but can you just remind me to what was the growth in drugs of abuse testing in the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: About 5%, consistent with what we saw in previous quarters.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, is it possible for you to give us any kind of update about the progress that the existing Quest sales force has made, specifically with regards to the sales of the Athena product line?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, you know, Gary, first of all, as we said that we don't -- Athena and Celera, the special sales force, and there is no chain there. But the important thing is that we take some products, like SMA, and it is sold through our physician sales channel and hospital sales channels so that we are seeing more traction in SMA. And also, it's now almost 12 to 18 months since we started investing and training our salespeople in physician sales and it's difficult in the beginning, but I'm very pleased to say that we really have a stable sales force and they're trained and they are very focused on some areas like Women's Health, prescription drug monitoring, and we are seeing results.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Is there any way to parse out how much of the growth in the, in volumes from Athena and Celera came from the Quest sales force versus the preexisting sales force?
Surya N. Mohapatra: We really don't break it down that way. And also, it's going to be very difficult because we integrate some of this business. So the way to look at it going forward, we have these 4 pillars, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurology, they will have their special sales force, but we also have 2 channels, actually 3: Physicians, hospitals and international. And we want to maximize our distribution channel depending on where the products are coming from, but it's going to be difficult for us to really exactly break down how much is coming from physicians and how much is coming directly Athena.
Operator: All right, our last question is from Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Erin Wilson: This is Erin Wilson in for Bob today. Just one quick one. Are you anticipating any other management changes now that you have a CEO in place?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, I am not expecting any, but I think you have to ask Steve.
Robert A. Hagemann: I think we need to give him a chance to get here.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, you know in closing, I want to say again that it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as President, CEO and Chairman of Quest Diagnostics. This is truly a great company with dedicated people who always put patients first, a strong management team and a very bright future. I look forward to following its progress in the years to come. And as regards to you, ladies and gentlemen, I've always appreciated your probing questions and industry insights and I will miss our interactions. Thank you, and goodbye.

Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, 2011 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. We delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, revenues grew 3% to $1.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.23 and cash flow was strong at $338 million. For the full year 2011, revenues grew about 2% to $7.5 billion, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $4.53 and the adjusted cash flow was strong at $1.1 billion. We continued to execute our revenue growth and cost reduction plans. The fourth quarter capped a year in which we made significant progress. Despite a further decline in physician office visits, we exceeded the earnings expectations we set at the beginning of the year. We completed the acquisitions of Athena and Celera and established a solid foundation in 4 critical areas of cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. We began a $500 million multiyear cost-reduction program. And with key acquisitions in place, we updated our capital deployment philosophy to return a majority of our free cash flow to shareholders over the medium term. During 2011, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, and we announced a 70% increase in our dividend beginning in 2012. As we have said before, our growth strategy is based on 3 elements: driving innovative new tests and advanced healthcare IT services, enhancing sales effectiveness and strengthening our relationship with health plans and other payers.  Let me say a few words about each of these elements. In the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing grew 17%, driven mainly by the contribution of neurological testing from Athena and cardiovascular testing from Berkeley HeartLab. Demand for gene-based and esoteric testing continued to grow faster than routine testing. For the full year, gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew 11%, testing volume for SureSwab was up more than 40%, Vitamin D was up 12%, and ImmunoCAP was up 4%. With the acquisition of Celera, along with Focus Diagnostics, we have assembled unique capabilities from discovery to laboratory developed tests to FDA-cleared IVD test kits. A good example of how we utilize these capabilities to drive personalized medicine is our STRATIFY JC virus test, which was just cleared by the FDA last week. We developed this test in collaboration with Biogen Idec. STRATIFY JCV helps physicians stratify risk for an infrequent brain infection in patients receiving Tysabri, an important multiple sclerosis therapy. With regard to our industry-leading connectivity solutions, we continue to gain users and drive customer loyalty. Approximately 200,000 physicians and clinicians now use our Care360 connectivity platform for lab orders and results. In addition, Care360 users increased the use of e-prescribing by about 50% to an annualized rate of 32 million medications. In 2011, Care360 was named the top e-prescribing platform by Black Book Rankings. Our Care360 electronic health record is now utilized by 4,400 physicians and has enabled them to receive payments for meaningful use. Last week, we announced a plan to help physicians nationwide adopt EHRs through our Care360 EHR grant program. Turning to sales effectiveness. As you know, our sales force expansion is complete, and we continue to enhance the support and training we provide. We have seen results when our sales force is focused on our competitive advantages, such as esoteric and gene-based testing, connectivity solution or various disease categories. Also, we continue to work with health plans and employers to move business to us from high-cost providers.  Regarding our 3-year $500 million cost-reduction program, we are making good progress. We have begun to implement some of our plans and expect to realize meaningful benefits in 2012. You will hear more details from Bob, who is leading this initiative. This initiative is all about building a sustainable platform for the future, one that will ensure we can continue to effectively compete in an ever-changing and increasingly challenging healthcare environment.  To improve shareholder value, the first and most important step is improving operating performance. That's why every member of our management team is focused on driving growth and efficiency. As we said last quarter, starting in 2012, ROIC will be an important component of management's long-term incentive compensation.  All in all, we made progress in 2011, but we have more to do. As you know, the Board of Directors is in the process of selecting my successor, and we'll keep you updated when we have more to report. Now Bob will provide analysis of our performance and our outlook for 2012, and then we'll take your questions. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: As noted by Surya, revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 3% above the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.23 compared to $1.03 in the prior year, a 19% increase. The earnings improvement is principally driven by top line growth and actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure. Adjusted EPS for the 2011 fourth quarter excludes $0.02 per share associated with restructuring and integration costs and $0.02 associated with the CEO transition. Adjusted EPS for last year's fourth quarter excludes $0.06 of charges associated with restructuring and employment litigation. These items are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release. Fourth quarter results include a benefit of $0.08 per share in 2011 and $0.05 per share in 2010 associated with discrete tax items. Consolidated revenue growth was driven by the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, which contributed about 3% to growth in the quarter. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, were 2.6% above the prior year and equal to the prior year before the contributions from Athena and Celera. Volume in the quarter grew 0.4% from the prior year and improved from the 1.2% decrease we saw in the third quarter. We estimate the impact of weather helped the fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons by about 0.4%. The market, in terms of estimated physician office visits, may be showing signs of stabilizing. In the quarter, the data reflects a 2% improvement compared to the prior year. While our most recent improvement in volume and the data and physician office visits is encouraging, we believe it's still too early to conclude the market has completely turned the corner. We are not expecting further declines in physician office visits in 2012, nor are we expecting much improvement from the current levels. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter, in line with growth of the last quarter. Revenue per requisition was 2.2% above the prior year, with the improvement due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. Base revenue per requisition has remained relatively stable throughout the year. Revenues in our nonclinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and healthcare IT, grew about 7% in the quarter, driven by the products business acquired as part of the Celera acquisition. For the full year, these businesses grew about 10%, with about half of the growth organic. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.9% compared to 17.2% in the prior year. Actions taken earlier in the year to reduce our cost structure are the principal driver of the improvement. Restructuring, integration and CEO transition costs totaling $11 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by about 60 basis points in the most recent quarter. In the last year's fourth quarter, charges associated with restructuring and litigation totaling $19 million reduced the reported operating income percentage by a full 1%. In July, we announced a multiyear initiative, the goal of which is to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of 2014. As we shared with you last quarter, the opportunities have been quantified and organized into a number of areas with dedicated teams of subject matter experts and cross-functional support. Each team has a very specific charter and financial target. Some of the areas around which teams are organized include: specimen acquisition, which includes all the costs associated with obtaining and transporting samples; client support, which includes billing and customer service; the labs themselves and all the costs associated with operating them; IT and customer connectivity costs; procurement and supply chain; and SG&A, both in the field and at corporate. Some areas are more developed than others. However, we have made significant progress in every area and remain confident in reaching our goal. We have now established specific targets which we expect to deliver about 20% of the $500 million goal by the end of 2012, with the remainder in 2013 and 2014. The benefits we expect to realize in 2012 are the principal driver of the margin expansion we expect this year. The areas where we are furthest along are in client support and procurement and supply chain, together which we expect to provide about 1/3 of our savings. Here, we plan to leverage technology to eliminate manual work, further standardize systems and processes, implement more self-service options for customers and leverage Lean Six Sigma to further streamline activities. In client support and billing, we plan to reduce manual work and customer call volume by enabling customers to do more online, including supplying insurance information, making payments, checking on the status of a bill and obtaining test results. In the area of procurement and supply chain, we will further consolidate suppliers, rationalize SKUs, standardize and optimize specs and work more closely with our suppliers in sharing information and managing costs from design to manufacture to distribution. As one example of the opportunity here, today, across our business, we use hundreds of different gloves, specimen bags and labels and more than a dozen different urine collection cups. We plan to significantly reduce these numbers and unlock the savings associated with bulk buying and the administration associated with handling all these different choices. Another roughly 1/3 of the savings is expected to come from SG&A, including IT. We are flattening the organization structure and simplifying management processes, which will not only reduce costs but drive increased accountability. In the area of IT, we will place greater emphasis on connectivity solutions which don't require computer hardware. Over time, this will dramatically reduce the cost of serving the tens of thousands of pieces of equipment we have in the field. In addition, connectivity installations will be done quicker and at lower costs. Other areas like the labs themselves and specimen acquisition, we expect to contribute the remainder of the savings. In these areas, we are addressing capacity utilization, including our lab footprint, service parameters, organization structure and supply consumption. Common themes across most areas include standardizing systems, processes and databases; increased use of automation and technology; and centralizing and selective outsourcing. For the next few years, this will require some increased level of capital spending to standardize systems and upgrade IT infrastructure.  We are fully committed to realizing the plan benefits from this program, which will not only make our company more efficient but also serve as a platform for accelerated growth. Today, we continue to produce industry-leading performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.5% in the quarter and 3.7% for the full year, reflecting continued improvement from the prior year. DSOs were 45 days compared to 44 days last quarter. Reported cash from operations was strong at $338 million. Before the effect of special items, cash from operations was about $300 million. For the full year, reported cash from operations was approximately $900 million and $1.1 billion dollars before the effect of special items. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter compared to $69 million a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 874,000 common shares at an average price of $57.21, for a total of $50 million. We completed $935 million in share repurchases for the full year. We are firmly committed to driving increases in shareholder returns. The best way to do this is by improving operating performance, and as you've heard, we are taking actions to accelerate organic revenue growth and establish a more efficient cost structure. We also intend to use our strong cash flows to enhance shareholder value.  As we stated last quarter, with a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities now in place, it is unlikely we will complete any large, strategic acquisitions in the near term. We will, however, continue to invest in our business in a very disciplined way to ensure we continue to differentiate Quest Diagnostics in an evolving marketplace but in a manner which should require significantly less capital than recent years. Our investments in growth are likely to focus on smaller fold-in acquisitions, like the S.E.D. acquisition completed earlier this month in New Mexico; investments in science and innovation in form of licensing, collaboration and internal development; and investments in technology, which will improve quality and efficiency in our labs and other parts of our business. We plan to use ROIC to guide these investment decisions and are committed to improving ROIC over time. Beginning in 2012, improving ROIC is a major component of our long-term compensation program. We are committed to increasing shareholder returns and improving ROIC to a framework which encompasses improving operating performance and a capital deployment philosophy which includes dividends, share repurchases and investments in our business. As we shared with you last quarter, this philosophy is grounded in maintaining a strong BBB credit rating, which minimizes our cost of capital and provides us appropriate access to credit in support of our business. As we have also indicated, in 2012, this will require us to use the majority of our free cash flow, about $500 million to $700 million to delever to a leverage ratio in the range of 2x to 2.25x. Upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio, we plan to commit the majority of our free cash flow be returned to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Last quarter, we announced a significant increase, 70%, in our dividend to an annualized amount of $0.68 per share. We expect the dividend will grow over time, commensurate with earnings and cash flows. In addition, share repurchases will remain an important tool for returning cash to shareholders. Earlier today, we announced that our board has authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.1 billion. There is no set time frame for utilizing our current authority, and the level of share repurchases will be a function of a number of factors. While we expect share repurchases to be relatively modest in 2012 due to our commitment to delever, we expect them to be much more significant the following year. Turning to 2012 guidance, we expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenues to grow between 2% and 2.5%, inclusive of the S.E.D. acquisition but before other potential acquisitions; operating income to approach 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion; capital expenditures to be between $225 million and $250 million, the increase from the prior year principally due to IT investments required to standardize systems and upgrade infrastructure; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.40 and $4.55. Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you, Bob. In summary, we see signs of progress in a number of areas to drive organic growth and reduce our costs. We are focused on increasing shareholder value and improving returns on capital. With the actions we have taken over the past years, we are well positioned for the future. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Feinstein.
Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Barclays Capital. Maybe just a quick start, I appreciate all of the background there on the outlook. But Bob, just maybe as you think about the revenue growth for 2012, I guess just what's embedded in there for volumes? And to the extent -- if you can't break it out that way, just help us think about, I guess, some of the benefits you'll get going forward relative to some of the headwinds you had this year. So I'm just trying to think about the -- because looking ahead of the quarter, the organic growth was relatively flat, but that was compared to the down 1% earlier in the year. So should we look for a continued ramp-up throughout 2012?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, and a couple things on that. First, when you look at the guidance, which is 2% to 2.5%, recognize that there is some carryover from the Athena and Celera acquisitions and some small benefit from the S.E.D. acquisition. Combined, that's worth a little over 1%. So that implies within the revenue guidance that there was about 1% organic growth there, and that compares to about flat this year from an organic perspective. So we are seeing some modest improvement there. As I said, we're not expecting the market to really pick up significantly as we look at 2012, nor are we expecting it to decline much. We're expecting it pretty much flattish for the most part and some relatively steady improvement in the revenue growth as we go through the year. As you know, we don't split out the components of revenue growth between price and volume.
Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then just once again, the fourth quarter showed progress relative to the earlier part of the prior year. But just how do you think about the revenue per req in that with the flat growth trend for the fourth quarter? I just wanted to get your sense in terms of what's going on with pricing. Are things stable? Is that the right way to think about that?
Robert A. Hagemann: The way I think you should view pricing going forward is reimbursement itself is going to continue to be under pressure, but what will fuel increases in revenue per req over time will be test mix and the number of test order per requisition, which has really been the principal driver for the last number of years. So that's one of the factors that we think about as we're considering what the revenue growth will be and what the guidance will look like.
Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just my final question, and I appreciate all the details with the slides, there was just a slide in there that had the revenue by payer, just a follow-up a little bit to my last question. And if I look at the Managed Care revenue, the decline in Managed Care revenues accelerated this year relative to last year. And then relative to overall revenue growth, it was a little bit weaker. So I just wanted to see what would be driving that. Is it just a function of just Managed Care volumes being lower than overall volumes? Or excuse me, I guess this is revenue per -- well, anyway, I just wanted to get your feedback in terms of the Managed Care revenue.
Robert A. Hagemann: Nothing specific that I can point to there, Adam. As I said, reimbursement does continue to be under pressure. We're offsetting much of that with test mix, but...
Surya N. Mohapatra: The membership.
Robert A. Hagemann: And membership declines could drive the mix there a little bit as well. And we also -- one thing that we pointed out earlier is we've had some mix shift between our plans as well this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: It's Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray. Just had a quick question about the molecular diagnostic reimbursement changes that Palmetto's trying to implement at the beginning of March. Is there any update as to whether that's moving forward? And then I'm just wondering, are you guys prepared to use and move over to McKesson Z-Codes? And also, what type of impact do you think this will have on you and the industry?
Kathleen Valentine: Kevin, in terms of where the Palmetto implementation stands, I mean, according to them, all signs seem to point to they are going forward with implementing their program effective March 1. As we've said previously, we're leveraging and working all resources available to us to fight it. We're working with the trade association. There's a lot of questions about the program and the administration around it and just clarity about what they're going to require and how the process is going to work. We've expressed those concerns through the trade association, so we are going to fight it, but it does appear that they are going to proceed. So we'll continue to evaluate what it means to us in terms of implementing it from an administrative perspective. But rest assured, we're working with others in our industry to fight it and try to either delay it or get better clarity around it. Relative to the impact to us, as we've said, the molecular testing revenues could be impacted by the new AMA code that will go into effect next year. It represents less than 5% of our total company revenues. So from a financial perspective, not significant in terms of what it represents relative to total revenues. We've also indicated that from a utilization perspective, this is all intended to get more clarity around what people are paying for and what's being performed. We feel very comfortable that the testing that we perform and bill for is appropriate. So from a utilization perspective, we feel very good about that. Until CMS establishes reimbursement for these new codes, we can't determine what, if any, impact there will be from a reimbursement perspective on these new tests, but from a utilization perspective, we feel comfortable.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Sure, I appreciate that color, Kathleen. And then actually, just one quick follow-up there. The AMA is also moving forward with their 101 new codes, which, like you said, haven't been assigned pricing yet from CMS. But I guess what's your view on if those AMA codes are put into the physician fee schedule versus clinical lab fee schedule? And then also, if Palmetto moves forward and then you have the AMA coming out with their codes in 2013, isn't that going to kind of create a mess in terms of reimbursement for the systems?
Kathleen Valentine: Yes. And that's one of our exact concerns, is that they will create a lot of confusion, and it will -- we and others in our industry have expressed that exact concern.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then I just wanted to switch back. Bob, you provided a lot of detail, and one thing I missed was when you said you plan to use your free cash flow to delever to 2x to 2.25x this year. How much do you plan on spending? Was it $500 million to $700 million?
Robert A. Hagemann: That's between $500 million and $700 million of debt paydown, Kevin.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just out of curiosity, just wondering what the status is on the CEO search, if you found some good external candidates or if there's any strong internals that you guys could talk about.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Kevin, this is Surya. CEO search is a top priority for our board, and the board is actively conducting the search. I don't have any information to report now, but as soon as we know something, we will let you know.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Tom, Lazard Capital Markets. Bob, I was just curious. A couple of quick questions, but one follow-up to something you had mentioned earlier, is seeing sort of a mix shift between plans and also sort of persistent reimbursement pressure. So I guess over and above the government aspect of things, can you talk about that mix shift between plans, remind us what you mean there? And maybe give us a little more on what you alluded to in terms of reimbursement pressure on the private side.
Robert A. Hagemann: Sure. Tom, as you would expect, the pricing that we have with different plans varies, and some plans are growing membership faster than others. So when I talk about the mix shift between the plans, that's really what I'm talking about there. That's impacting the overall average reimbursement from third-party health plans. And with respect to reimbursement pressure, look, it's no news. Reimbursement is going to be under pressure, will continue to be under pressure, whether be it from government payers or private payers. And as we've said before, that's one of the reasons that we've initiated the $500 million cost-reduction program.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right. So the mix shift, just sort of more of the luck of the draw, it's not a change toward high deductible plans or anything like that, that you're alluding to?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, not at this point, not that we can see or have visibility to at this moment. Although as we think about the shift to high-deductibility plans, that is a bit of a wildcard as it relates to utilization, not so much reimbursement, but utilization.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Right, right. Can you remind us sort of to what extent you've got contracts or bigger contracts that we should be thinking about up for renewal over the next 18 months?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, we always have a fair number of contracts set to expire in any given year, but there are no big national contracts set to expire this year. Overall, when I look at what's set to expire in 2012, it's probably a little less than we would have in an average year.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, good. And then you mentioned the doc visits. Your data showed that maybe it was up a couple percent in the quarter. Looks like organically, your volume was closer to flattish. So do you think that the lab industry volume was up more like the doc volume, or sort of how do you sort of see the correlation between doc data and what the lab industry underlying market might be doing?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, it's an interesting question, Tom, because there are lots of sources of data. There's the IMS data that showed that they were up about 2% in the quarter. There's analysis that JPMorgan puts out which shows that they were down in the quarter. So it's really hard to say. I mean, I feel as though it improved, though, because both sets of metrics indicated improvement from the third quarter. But as you know, it's really hard to get a gauge on what the market is doing, particularly in any single quarter. But we are encouraged that it looks like there's some signs that things may be starting to improve or at least stabilize.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. Last one, if I could. Pathology has been a pressure point not only in volume, but I guess that impacts your sort of pricing calculation as well. Where do we sort of stand on the trends there?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, that's a business that when you look at the data that we put out there, you'll see it was down again this year. Total AP revenues were down almost 6% versus the prior year. I think the year before, they were down about 10%. So we've seen some moderation there, but that's a piece of our business that we expect will continue to be under pressure from insourcing. As you've heard us say before, we're working with legislators and other policy-setters to make them aware of the fact that insourcing drives, in some cases, unnecessary utilization. So we're hoping to get a long-term solution there. But in the short term, we're continuing to do what we can to sell our value proposition. We've added some sales people in that regard, and we think that, that is helping mitigate some of it. But as we said, we're looking for a longer-term fix there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Crédit Suisse. Bob, real quick, does your guidance include share repo?
Robert A. Hagemann: It does, Ralph, but, as I said, at a much more modest level than we saw this year. When you think about how much cash we generate in a given year, we gave you guidance for cash from ops of about $1.2 billion, CapEx of $225 million to $250 million. So that gets you down to a free cash flow number of about $950 million or so. We said we're going to delever between $500 million and $700 million, so if you use the midpoint, about $600 million, which also approximates our short-term debt that we have outstanding. Then you consider the dividend that we've got, that we've committed to, which is a little over $100 million. What's available for share repurchases and acquisitions is a little over $200 million. And while we're not expecting a significant acquisition activity this year, we did do a small one already with the S.E.D. acquisition. So that does limit the amount of share repurchases we can do in 2012, but as I said, we expect the share repurchases to ramp up pretty significantly next year, after we've completed the delevering.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just along those lines, does your guidance assume the lower interest expense that's going to come with sort of the lower debt levels?
Robert A. Hagemann: Sure.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's assumed in guidance?
Robert A. Hagemann: Absolutely. I mean, we factor all that in, both the share repurchases and the debt levels. Keep in mind that the interest rate on the outstanding debt is very modest at this point. It's pretty low. We're a pretty low-interest rate environment. And the term loan that the we're paying off is a LIBOR plus, so we're looking at pretty significantly low rate there.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And so help us sort of understand the margin commentary then. I mean, you ended the quarter with close to 18% operating margin. I think you had over 18% in the third quarter. Your guidance says you expect to approach 18%, yet you've got sort of 20% of your cost savings that's going to sort of start in earnest in 2012. So I guess just help me reconcile the margin run rate that we've had the sort of back half of this year relative to what seems to be your implied lower margin profile for next year or for this year, 2012.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, I would be a little careful, Ralph, in looking at any one quarter and trying to extrapolate it. What I'd suggest you look at is the full year operating income percentage, which was 17.6% on an adjusted basis. Think about that compared to the approaching 18% that we're providing for 2012. As I said in the script, the margin expansion that we are expecting is principally from the cost-reduction effort. As we've said in the past, this is a business, with all of the fixed costs that we've got and the inflationary pressure on the elements that is salaries, wages and benefits, that you need to grow organically 2-plus percent to be able to hold margins. And as I said earlier, the organic growth that we're contemplating here is more in the 1% range. So it's the cost-reduction program that's helping improve those margins year-over-year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Any consideration going to cash earnings?
Robert A. Hagemann: Look, yes, you can calculate it if you would like. It's readily available. We do report adjusted earnings so that people can understand what we view as the unusual items in the quarter. Otherwise, it's GAAP-adjusted for those things. Cash earnings is not something that we've historically done. It's readily available for folks to calculate, and it can certainly be calculated.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just my last one, Surya, I think you had talked about working with plans, get more business away from sort of the higher-cost and over to Quest. So I mean, can you talk about any changes to benefit design that you may be aware of and/or what you're doing with employers that's sort of incremental to 2012 relative to where you were last year or 2 years ago?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, Ralph, as you know, it takes quite a bit of time. But I am encouraged by the traction or even the engagement that some of these health plans have. And along with them, we're talking to the employers, and the whole objective is -- and they know also, to meet their goals, they have to persuade the doctors to send the testing to our network and to avoid the high-cost providers. So that's one thing happening. The other thing which is becoming very exciting and will put us in a very advantageous position is this evolution of ACOs. And they are unique data. They are unique connectivity. They are unique analytics. So we are having a lot of discussions with them. So it may not have anything concrete in 2012, but I see that all the assets and capabilities we have accumulated over the years -- now there are 200,000 doctors that are using our Care360. We have a huge databank. So those are the things that are going to help us to work with health plans in this evolving healthcare reform. But along with that also, they are also narrowing down their network, and that's also helping when the other laboratories are removed from the network. So we'll continue working with them, and it's a part of our growth strategy.
Operator: We have a question from A.J. Rice.
Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Susquehanna Financial. A couple of questions, if I could ask. This is a high-level sort of question, but if you look at your anticipated revenue growth of a couple percent, on a full year basis, you're improving margin modestly. You got the share repurchase, and you're paying down $600 million in debt and getting the benefit of the interest expense savings on that. I guess when I put all those things together, I'm surprised that you'd still forecast EPS to be effectively down on an adjusted basis or flat to down. Is there something we're missing when you take those components? Because that would seem to point to at least modest growth.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, a couple things, A.J. First, as I said earlier, we can catch you off-line, but we want to make your interest expense assumption for the debt paydown is appropriate. Again, the interest expense there is very modest. The other thing that I would tell you is when you think about the tax rate, it's not going to be the same tax rate as this year. This year, we had a number of discrete items in there which helped the tax rate. And if you want to think about the right tax rate to use, I'd suggest you look in the footnotes and you look at the rates we've used, the tax effect, some of the items in there, in Footnote 2 in the press release.
Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, all right. We'll do that, and we could follow up off-line. Maybe on a big picture as well question about Washington. It seems like there was a lot of focus coming up to year-end on the doc fix. We had the House proposal, the Senate proposal, and at least using those 2 as metrics, it seemed like the lab sector sort of made it through. What are you hearing in terms of this next phase of trying to get the doc fix done? Do we rest a little -- do we seem like we're in a little better spot than maybe we look like 6 months ago?
Robert A. Hagemann: A.J., I think everything's still up in the air at this point, whether it be co-pays, deductibles or reimbursement changes. Obviously, we don't think any of those are appropriate for our industry. We feel as though we've made some pretty significant contributions in terms of givebacks, and in addition, we want to make sure that whatever is done isn't counter-productive in trying to drive down the total cost of care because as we've said repeatedly in one of our arguments is that while this is a very small piece of the total spend, it has a very significant influence on treatment of physicians in the total cost of care. And you don't want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish here. So we're continuing to make our case. We think we have a good one, but I would tell you that it's still up in the air as to what the outcome is going to be with respect to the permanent doc fix.
Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then last question, I appreciate that you guys don't have significant large contracts up for renewal over the next 12 months, but I had understood, at least, that maybe an opportunity for you guys was that the Horizon contract, which you're not in now, was up for grabs, and that we might even hear something by year-end. I personally haven't heard anything. Have you guys heard any update on that, any thoughts?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, you know, if I hear, I will let you know. And we are always working with our health plans and trying to meet their needs. But we haven't heard anything from them either.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One follow-up question on guidance. So just to clarify, is the additional, I think, compensation, Surya, for your retirement included in the 2012 numbers or not?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, it's not. That's being treated as a special item, just like it was in this quarter. And as we said, back at the end of Q3, we expect that to be about $14 million in total. There was roughly $6 million that went through this quarter. The remainder will go through in the first half, certainly before May next year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So just to make sure that we get all the line items right, and I know it's a follow-up on a question that was asked before, but it just seems that your guidance seems very conservative, and I want to make sure that we're not missing anything. So is really most of what's, I would say, the headwind to your guidance are below the EBIT line? Is that kind of like a correct way to look at it?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, Ricky, to try and put it in perspective for you, one, we've talked about the tax rate a little bit, so you want to make sure you're using the correct tax rate. The other topic that we've covered in a couple different forms this morning is the share repurchases. While we are going to do some share repurchases, they will be more modest than they have been this past year. And we're not expecting the weighted average shares outstanding to change much from this year because the share repurchases that we will do will pretty much offset the shares issued in connection with employee benefit plans this year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then recently, we've heard some discussion on formularies for lab testing. Can you elaborate a little bit on this? Have you seen formularies being implemented, and do you think this is going to affect where the future will be and what your role will be in setting and managing those formularies?
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky, we have not seen that, really, anywhere at this point. Certainly, as we've talked to accountable care organizations and the like, we're trying to understand how we can work with them to not only manage their laboratory costs but more importantly, manage the total cost of care. And that really means getting the right testing to the right person at the right time and then using the data that's generated from that to make informed decisions and oftentimes, marrying that with other data. We haven't really, in those discussions, had much conversations about lab formularies. Although you may have heard it someplace, we have not.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. You discussed moderating trends in physician office visits and the various data sources that are out there. We saw an improvement in our December volumes based on our survey. I was wondering if maybe you could talk about how much you think this is a moderating trend versus are you seeing benefits from patients heading to the doctor before deductible resets in January. I know there's been a lot of anecdotal commentary on higher deductible plans in 2012. What do you think about this trend?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's really hard to gauge, quite frankly. We don't know for sure why patients either go or choose not to go to the doctor, particularly in any one month. And December is a very difficult month to predict anything off of. As you point to, there's typically this trend either in the fourth quarter or particularly in December where people are going in, trying to get their visits in prior to potentially higher co-pays, higher deductibles or more cost shifting in the next year. And there's been some speculation that that might be more pronounced this year as a result of expectations for further cost shifting in 2012. But it's really hard to gauge. I mean, it's speculation. I don't think anybody has any good data on that.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I guess you're not going to give us an update on maybe how January trends are going on then?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, we typically don't provide any information on how volumes are trending within a quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Bonello.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Bill Bonello with RBC. I would like to follow up on, I guess, the topic that A.J. and Ricky were sort of hitting you on, and maybe I can try asking the question in a slightly different way because frankly, I think it's the most important question as we try and assess where you're heading. And I appreciate that hopefully, you have set an EPS guidance that is meetable and maybe even beatable. But a couple of things. I guess just point-blank, would you expect operating income to grow year-over-year in 2012? Is that your expectation?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, if you have revenue growing and you have the operating income percentage growing, by definition, operating income grows.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Well, I would have thought so, too. So then my next question would be I understand what you're saying about less share repurchase, but you're saying shares essentially flat. I understand what you're saying about some people may be getting a little carried away in their interest expense projections, but I can't imagine that interest expense will be more year-over-year if you're paying down debt. So it would seem to me like the only real explanation for your expectation that EPS would be down year-over-year to flat would have to be the difference in the tax rate. I mean, is there any other item that actually puts pressure on EPS?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, I think you've identified most of them, and tax rate is an important piece of it, yes.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then this will be my last question. Can you make it a little easier for us instead of, "Hey, go into the footnote and pick out one of the tax rates that we used to adjust our earnings," and just say, "Hey, here's what we kind of think the effective tax rate will be in 2012 versus what it was in the 2011"?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, Bill, without giving you the specific tax rate that we have in our guidance, what I would point out to you is in Footnote 2, there's a rate which we use. It's sort of an overall blended effective rate of 38.7%, which we used to tax-effect the number of items there. In that range is what you should be thinking.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And what was the effective rate this year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, the effective rate this year is impacted by a lot of things, particularly the government settlement and the like. And overall, it was 35.7%, but you can't use that as a proxy for what it would be going forward.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: No, no, I get that. But we're getting -- on the tax item, we're getting a couple hundred basis points of sort of pressure on net earnings from just how you're looking at effective taxes for comparing year-over-year growth.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So your guidance kind of understates actually, I think, the health of the business. That's all I was trying to figure out.
Operator: We have a question from Dane Leone.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Macquarie Capital. Could you just give us an idea on the pacing of the debt paydown? Is this going to be mostly in the first quarter or second quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: Dane, I would tell you that it will most likely be over the course of the year. It won't be first quarter, second quarter. It's really going to be a function of how cash flows are trending. While we do have some debt, a big chunk of debt that's due in May, we will likely draw on some short-term revolvers and the like to fund some of that paydown and then use cash from operations to fund the rest and then, over the course of the year, get the debt level to where we're suggesting.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: The maturity in May is somewhere around $500 million, right?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just on the gross margins, they're very strong in the fourth quarter. How should we think of just within the operating line? Do you expect that trend to persist as you continue to benefit from Celera and higher-margin Athena business maybe offset just by the sales cost on the SG&A line?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, I would, again, caution anybody to look at any one quarter and extrapolate there, particularly on a particular line. What I would tell you, though, about cost of sales in SG&A is cost of sales is a line that actually benefits from both the Celera and Athena acquisitions, whereas the SG&A line is increased as a result of them. Net-net, it's a positive to the combined SG&A and cost of sales and neutral generally in operating income after amortization.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Great. And just one follow-up on that. In terms of the contracts with the Managed Care plans and payers for Athena, basically, Athena's testing, where are you at integrating that into the overall umbrella of Quest?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, we're still in the process. We're not expecting there to be much integration with respect to Athena, quite frankly, because of the truly esoteric nature of those tests. BHL, on the other hand, is an opportunity for us to get more on contract because of how frequently that sort of testing is being ordered. And we are doing that. We're expanding contract access for BHL. We're opening up our patient service centers and our logistics, and we believe that, that's actually going to help with the turnaround of BHL. It will take some time, but those are important steps that we're taking there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions here. First, I wanted to just ask, Bob, you talked about some increased CapEx related to IT, and could you just briefly update us on what your plans are there? And are you ultimately moving to a common operating platform? How should we be thinking about your IT platforms at this point?
Robert A. Hagemann: Darren, as we talked about in the discussion of the $500 million cost-reduction program, one of the elements of that is standardizing systems processes and databases. And certainly, an element of the increasing CapEx is going towards that. Yes, I would also tell you, though, that when I look at the CapEx that we had this past year, 2011, there were some things that we put on hold in anticipation of trying -- maybe doing something differently as we went through this cost-reduction program. And as a result, some of the increase that we see next year is also just the catch-up on some deferral of a few items.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess I did have a question about the acquisition model that you, I guess, have with the S.E.D. deal. And could you just update us on how you're thinking about some of the hospital deals that you're looking at? This looks like you have a management contract in place for the hospital lab, and you're picking up the outreach business. Is that something that you think you can replicate elsewhere? And just maybe an update on how you're thinking about working with hospitals.
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, I think it is something that could potentially be replicated elsewhere. I would tell you that we have hospital lab management agreements that have been put in place for -- they've been there for many years and were not put in place in connection with acquisitions. So those are opportunities that we have irrespective of whether or not there's an opportunity to acquire outreach business. But yes, we do think that those are the type of acquisitions that we'll see more of as time goes by. They're relatively small. They are fold-in type acquisitions, and we have a good history of executing against those. And I think hospitals are asking themselves whether or not lab testing is strategic. They all have different views, I guess. But hopefully, there will be more opportunities like this.
Surya N. Mohapatra: But this is a very important subject because as the hospitals buy more doctors, obviously, our hospital business benefits from the reference tests, but also, our capability in IT and our capability in managing laboratories and also our relationship with the health plans gives us an opportunity. So again, if you think about 60% of this market is in the hospital, and working with the health plans and working with the hospitals, we expect to use this as a strategy to go forward. And as Bob said, many hospital CEOs, they have different views. But a lot of people are really interested to see how they can leverage our expertise and, at the same time, get some capital by selling our outreach business.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's helpful. Last question, and just forgive the blunt nature of it, but I guess I'm surprised that we didn't see a goodwill write-down in the pathology business. It's down mid-teens over the last couple of years, and I'm sure you've tested the cash flows as you do normally at the end of the period. Can you just give us a sense for what the outlook is for that business, and are you expecting a turnaround? And is that why we didn't get a goodwill write-down?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, first, Darren, you shouldn't think about a likely goodwill write-down there yet. It's part of our clinical testing business. That's a single segment. It's fully integrated, and when we look at that business, the value of it is far in excess of the total carrying value. So you shouldn't be looking for that. Secondly, as we said, it's a business that continues to be under pressure. The whole market is under pressure, not just our AP business. And we are doing some things that we think, over time, will help that. But yes, you have to take a long-term view with respect to this business. It's a very important element of cancer diagnostics overall. Cancer diagnostics is going to be fast-growing, and atomic pathology will be a growing element of it over time as well. And we feel as though we're very well positioned there. No one has the breadth and depth that we have in that area. And while there are some challenges now and we expect that there'll be some pressure, at least for the foreseeable future, we think we're very well positioned for the long term.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Just to remind you. When we bought AmeriPath -- actually, there are 3 elements of AmeriPath. The specialty laboratories is a part of it. Esoteric lab is very well integrated and is very effective. [indiscernible] diagnostics is doing really well, and it just -- they are now doing pathology. Both AmeriPath and Quest is under pressure, but it is the key element of cancer diagnostics, and it's going to show clearly improved results when we see the insourcing stabilizes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. Since last quarter, you guys have announced a number of new initiatives: the cost cutting, the share repurchase, the debt paydown and the dividends. Obviously, at the same time, you've got the CEO search going on. So can you maybe talk a little bit about what kind of flexibility the new CEO is going to have to potentially change or augment some of the strategies that you laid out? Or is it going to be a prerequisite for the new CEO to sort of be on board with the strategies that have been laid out so far?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well you know, Gary, first of all, all the things that we're doing, we had it in plan to do in the beginning of the year because -- this has been a multiyear program as far as repositioning Quest Diagnostics to drive esoteric and gene-based testing and putting a $500 million cost-reduction so that we can withstand the cost pressure. And also, when we have finished or at least completed Athena and Celera, along with AmeriPath and Focus, our goal was that we'll spend couple of years in integrating, so we could return majority of the cash to the shareholders. So having said all those things, all the strategic and personal activities we're doing with the management is also in line with the board. We believe that we have a very important strategy. Going forward, the new CEO will leverage the unparalleled access and distribution we have in science and innovation and healthcare IT to drive, along with the routine testing, the esoteric and gene-based testing in cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease and neurological. So from the strategy point of view, we've been building it. Now as far as -- every CEO have their own way of looking at certain things, and he or she is going to work with the board. But there's not a single thing we're doing here which is going to limit the person who is going to drive up this company after I go.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Gary, I'll just add, the entire management team and the board feel very good about the strategy that we've got, and that's what you're hearing here. It doesn't mean that somebody new might not have a different perspective, but really, what you're hearing is our confidence in what we've told you we're going to do.
Operator: We have a question from Amanda Murphy.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: William Blair. I just had a quick question on some commentary you've made previously about sort of your patient service infrastructure and the sales force and you've been working on upgrading the sales force. So curious, it doesn't sound like those 2 areas are a specific focus in terms of the cost cutting. So just looking for an update on where you stand with those 2 initiatives.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, as I told you that our organic growth strategy, obviously, driving the faster-growing esoteric and gene-based testing but also improving sales effectiveness. And it has taken us couple of years to have the right people in the right place, and our sales force expansion is complete. And obviously, we are helping them in training and support, and I'm happy. And you can -- we're seeing early signs of traction in areas where we say we're going to get focus. So we are not reducing the number of salespeople. But as far as the patient service centers is concerned, as Bob said, that we are looking at how many patient service centers we have in ward areas, and we're trying to optimize so that in some areas, we may have too many and in some areas, we may have too few. But we are going to look at the whole patient service centers demographics as far as convenience and cost point of view.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So how do you guys think about just maintaining service levels done just in that kind of...
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, the first thing we have to do is to make sure that we don't do anything that reduce service level. And the service level is linked to its customer phasing activities, whether it's patient service center, whether it's phlebotomy, whether it is IT services. So those things are -- more or less, we are trying to optimize them, but the reduction of cost is coming from procurement, billing, G&A and all other activities which has a less impact on customer phasing services.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Amanda, if anything, the services that are valued most by our customers are areas where we could potentially invest more, whereas the services that are valued least are the ones that pose opportunities for us.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then just a question, you talked about the SureSwab growth, which was pretty meaningful. I'm just curious, obviously, the physician community likes it. Are payers talking about it? What's kind of the general buzz out there?
Surya N. Mohapatra: I haven't heard anything specific. SureSwab is a new test for gynecological infection. We had a weakness in that area, and women's health is a big focus for us. And I'm very happy that the test volume is up 40%.
Kathleen Valentine: And Amanda, payers were getting reimbursed for SureSwab, so we have no issues or concerns there.
Operator: We have a question from Robert Willoughby.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bob, can you hazard a guess on restructuring cost for 2012?
Robert A. Hagemann: I can't really at this point, Bob. We're not in a position to do that. I think a lot of that's going to be a function of the pacing of the execution of the cost-reduction program.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Is the run rate for the fourth quarter a good one to carry forward? It will be something I would think on a quarterly basis, right?
Robert A. Hagemann: There may be -- I will be -- as I said, I'd be very careful taking any one quarter and extrapolating it. A lot of these charges are really driven by decisions, and some of those decisions we'll be able to make will cut across the enterprise. Some of those decisions will be impacting unit by unit. So at this point, yes, I don't have good visibility to tell you how those costs will shake out. But certainly, we'll give you as much information as we can on those costs when we do incur them. And to the degree that we have good visibility a quarter or so out, we can try and provide some information there.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And I think maybe like others, I thought the guidance for '12 would have been a little bit higher. And I'm just wondering, is there any correlation between how you gave the guidance and the ongoing CEO search? I would assume a new guy would want to kind of set his own bar here, and have you given him some leeway?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, Bob. I would tell you that we've really not changed our approach to establish that.
Surya N. Mohapatra: And I won't allow him to do that either.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And maybe a last one, I know I'm not going to get an answer on this one, but since you've announced the CEO search and you've been very adamant that the board is onboard with the strategies that you've laid out, but does a response from an inquiry from somebody from the outside come in and ask a few questions about other value-creating alternatives, or is it just radio silent out there?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, we are focused on driving [indiscernible] as far as I'm concerned. Although we are looking for a new CEO, every day, we are working as if I'll be here forever. So that's number one. Because I truly believe that we have built, really, a great company, and we have very unique capabilities. And yes, we have some headwinds, but that's not the reason why one should really abandon strategy. To me, strategy is sticking to it. The board is looking for my successor, and obviously, the person will have some flexibility. But the strategy is built in conjunction with the board, and I'm very proud of the company we built.
Robert A. Hagemann: Bob, I would add to that. I think the best opportunity for us to create value is by effectively executing against that strategy.
Operator: We have a question from Ashim Anand.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Natixis. Now obviously, Tysabri is a big drug, $1.2 billion a year, and half of it is coming from countries outside U.S., I guess as many as 65 countries. Now if the test were to go with Tysabri, how do you see this happening outside U.S.? You would be collaborating with Biogen and Elan in terms of sales, or how would this work?
Kathleen Valentine: Yes, we will collaborate with Biogen and Elan in distributing the test throughout the world. And as you know, it's an FDA-authorized test and also the test kit. So we would work with them in distributing it worldwide.
Surya N. Mohapatra: By there's a little bit more to this, as you may have pointed out. We are the only company probably in the world who has all this capability, what I call end-to-end capability. We have -- laboratories can develop tests, but they don't have the capability of creating IVD kits. We can create -- we can have by discovery -- from discovery to laboratory developed tests to IVD kits, and then we can work with IVD distributors to distribute to someone else. So I think this strategy of putting together Celera and Focus Diagnostics, along with our Nichols, is really a great opportunity for us going forward because targeted therapy is going to come. You are absolutely right. It's a $1 billion market for Biogen Idec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to collaborate with them, and there's a couple of other things going in that area.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Part of my next question, you've already answered. But maybe then it's safe to assume that these guys came to you, these pharma companies, biotech companies came to you for this specific is because you had both the product and the service component. Is that a fair thing to assume here?
Surya N. Mohapatra: We are being noticed very differently than before because we have these unique capabilities of developing tests and also making IVD kits and getting it through FDA, so the answer to your question is yes.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Now in terms of some of the revenue streams in terms of payers, physicians and others grew 13%, which was a little surprising, and hospital and reference lab, also 7%, and then to my surprise, Medicare and Medicaid, also 3%. Now excluding the benefits of Celera and Athena, if you can kind of just give a general commentary on these 3 revenue streams, what was going on and what do you see going forward?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, again, Ashim, some of this is impacted by the acquired revenues of both Celera and Athena. And it's really difficult for us to break out the impact on each of these components for you right here. We don't have that data available to us at the moment. But there's nothing in the payer mix that I would say is a significant trend other than the fact that we did see some declines in the patient volumes there. I think a lot of that was driven by the economy. And otherwise, it's been pretty consistent in terms of the way the payer mix has trended.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Okay. And finally, your EHR service that you provide to physicians, obviously, is distinguished. I was wondering if you'd like to comment on your giving 85% discount, which I thought was a little high. Maybe if you can comment on the strategy. Maybe this is a market share gain kind of strategy, or physicians are hurting obviously, maybe you want to make most of it. Just what would be the strategy behind the steep discount?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, this is a grant program, and it is only for 2 years. And this is actually to enhance the adoption of EHRs. As you know, the doctors are the last one to really adopt it. So now we have a product which has been certified for meaningful use. We have 4,400 people are using it. And the various components of that product, whether it is e-prescribing or whether it is clinical rules, all those things have been very well regarded. So our goal is to increase our installed base and have market penetration. So I think this grant program is going to help us. By the way, when it helps us, it also helps us in the diagnostics business because we see whenever anybody has our connectivity, we get more requisition from them, and it also helps the doctors to streamline their operations and get some revenues from the government.
Operator: We have a question from Gary Taylor.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Citigroup. I just had a few quick follow-ups. Bob, on that term loan, am I right that's still L-plus, about 55 basis points, so the effective rate is 1% or less?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And I guess at least for my part, given that we've been normalizing the tax rate all year, I see your EPS guidance as applying somewhere between up 3% and 5% on a normalized tax basis, excluding repurchase. Does that make sense to you?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, again, I'm not sure what you mean on a normalized basis. The effective rate for this year is about 3 points lower than what's embedded in the guidance. But the effective rate for this year has a lot of things that are driving it that won't continue.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. I guess my point is to me, the 2012 earnings guidance looks to be up year-over-year if you normalize the tax rate in '11 and you exclude the legal costs and some of the restructuring charges.
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, yes, I think you're right, Gary. As we've said, the operating performance is certainly expected to improve. We're looking for revenue growth, and we're looking for expansion of operating income. So the pure operating earnings, we are expecting to be up versus last year.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. In the fourth quarter, where you really beat me was on gross margin, cost of goods, and I know during the call, you've alluded to, I guess, better gross margin and some of the acquired revenue streams. Is there anything else unusual about the quarter? And I mean, it could be good or bad. I'm not saying unusual as in bad, but just that you're doing a better job on cost of goods, and that's something that carries into '12. Or should I not read too much into the increase in gross margin year-over-year outside of the acquisitions?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, again, I would caution you not to read too much into any one quarter. I think coming into the quarter, we're very conscious on managing costs. I think we've done a good job not only in terms of advancing the $500 million program but really ratcheting down on a day-to-day cost and managing those pretty effectively. I think you're seeing some of that come through. How much of that day-to-day management of cost we can continue at the same rate, there's probably some question around that. But I do feel good about the way we've managed cost overall this past year and think that it's going to certainly help us as we go into 2012. So we've got some good momentum there, and that's only going to be fueled by what we're doing with the longer-term program.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I just wanted to -- I wanted to ask a question on the acquired revenues. So to us, it looks like in '12 -- you'd mentioned this, but Athena, it looks like there's 3 months of revenue that had not yet -- will not have yet anniversary-ed in '12 and about 4.5 months for Celera. To us, that looks like about a benefit of about $76 million of revenue year-over-year, and although you haven't disclosed it, we thought we found a $90 million revenue number for S.E.D. labs. So combined, both of those look like about a 1% benefit in terms of year-over-year revenue growth. Am I materially off on those?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, you are with S.E.D., Gary. S.E.D. is probably -- the acquired revenue is in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. All right, that's helpful. Last question, I just want to come back to kind of thinking about routine versus esoteric volumes, and I guess you had said total volumes, up 40 bps, but excluding the positive weather impact, essentially flat. We were estimating acquired volumes added maybe 1 point to 1.5 points. And so I'm just trying to think about if routine volumes are still growing high single digit or close to double digit, does that imply that routine testing volumes on an organic basis are still down 3% or 4%, 5% year-over-year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Gary, just to clarify, when you said that you were estimating acquisitions added 1 point to volumes, the volume impact of the Celera and the Athena acquisitions is negligible, well less than 0.5%, and almost all of the benefit from the revenue growth shows up in revenue per requisition there. So back to your point, though, I would tell you that when you look at the routine volumes, they have been down year-over-year, but not to the degree that you've estimated there.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It sounds like my math, be like maybe more like down 1 or 2 based on what you said about the acquired volume.
Robert A. Hagemann: That's more in line, yes.
Operator: We have a question from Steven Valiquette.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Steve Valiquette of UBS. So just 2 questions for me. I guess first, is there any update on where everything stands on the potential repeal of the component of the Stark Law that allows physicians self-referral of lab testing? And then the second question is kind of along those lines, but as far as your anatomic pathology volume trends for all of 2011, any chance you can provide that growth number, or do we have to wait for the 10-K to come out to get that?
Kathleen Valentine: On the first part of your question, Steve, there is no update. We continue to work with our legislators in Washington to effect change. We do have access to certain congressmen and women to educate them on the impact that self-referral has in a physician's office not only on the cost of the test but also the utilization of testing. So that work continues, but there's nothing notable to report on that front.
Robert A. Hagemann: Kathleen, the other question was about the AP trends. Is the data out there yet and if not, when?
Kathleen Valentine: Oh, yes. Steve, the information is out on the annual revenues that we post. It's out on the IR website. If you look at supplemental analysis, it's available there, too.
Operator: Our final question comes from Bryan Brokmeier.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: This is Bryan from Maxim Group. Should your issued shares for employee benefit plans in 2012 be similar to 2011?
Robert A. Hagemann: Generally in line. I'm not expecting that it'll be dramatically different.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. So based on where your shares are currently trading and, Bob, the $200 million in cash available you mentioned for share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions, your share count should increase in 2012, correct?
Robert A. Hagemann: We're not expecting it to increase much. But yes, we're expecting it to be pretty close to the weighted average share count that we've got now.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Bob, you mentioned on some other questions earlier on the restructuring charges, you said to the extent you have visibility one quarter in advance, you'll provide that on the restructuring charges. Do you have any visibility on the first quarter charges, any range?
Robert A. Hagemann: Not meaningful visibility at this point other than the CEO succession costs, which we've said are going to be about $8 million or so.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And on that note, Surya, are you still planning to replace -- sorry, do you expect to replace Surya within the next 3 months? Because so the 6 months from when you announced the process brings us to April. So is that still the plan?
Surya N. Mohapatra: That's the plan.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And so we should maybe be expecting to see a new CEO announcement anytime now? Or how long do you estimate is sufficient time for a smooth transition to the new CEO?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, as I said, the board is actively conducting the search. This is the top priority. And the most important thing is to find the right person who will take this company to greater heights in the next 5 to 7 years. So I don't have any information, but by April 30, we'll have a new CEO.

Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. We have a lot of news to share with you this morning. In a moment, we are going to review our earnings news and discuss our increased dividend and our push to capital deployment. But first, let me tell you about today's succession announcement. As we indicated in our press release earlier today, we have begun a CEO succession process. I joined Quest Diagnostics in 1999 and have seen revenue growth 5x to $7.5 billion. The company has grown from a simple lab to the most advanced genomic and acetylic testing powerhouse for cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. With unmatched assets in science and innovation, information technology and access and distribution now in place, the Board and I have agreed, that after almost 12 years, this is the right time to transition to new leadership.  The Board is engaged in the thought process and will consider both external and internal candidates. Importantly, nothing changes today. I will continue to focus on executing our operating and strategic plan until I turn over leadership to a new CEO. I have agreed to continue to serve as Chairman and CEO for up to 6 months to ensure a smooth transition to my successor. I'll be happy to take any questions you may have at the end of today's call following our prepared remarks.  Turning to our forefronts in the third quarter. Revenues grew 2.2%, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% and we generated strong cash flow. We are beginning to see positive signs in a number of areas, but we have more work to do. The current market environment remains challenging, nevertheless, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns. We have framework that encompasses improving operating performance and a balanced capital deployment philosophy.  Our growth strategy is focused on 3 main elements: driving faster-growing esoteric and gene-based testing for cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders; enhancing sales effectiveness; and strengthening our relationships with health plans and other payers. Now during the quarter, we continue to see increased demand for our advanced diagnostic services. Gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew 14%, driven by the contribution of neurological testing from Athena and cardiovascular testing from Berkeley Heart, as well as women's health testing specifically, SureSwab. Demand for esoteric and gene-based testing continued to grow faster than routine testing.  We continue to be focused on maintaining and expanding our access to ensure lives. We are working closely with health plans and implores to reduce costly out-of-network leakage by getting involved in benefit plan design and offering employers an extensive set of turnkey tools that channel employees to low-cost testing. In addition, through our QuestNet lab solution, we build and manage lab networks for health plans. As regards to the cost, we have had an ongoing focus on cost structure both to ensure that our costs are aligned with volume in the short term and to make needed changes to make us more competitive and profitable for the future.  Last quarter, we told you about our comprehensive initiative to reduce our cost structure by $500 million over 3 years. We are following a deliberate process to identify opportunities and ensure that we will not do anything to jeopardize patient care, medical quality or growth. You will hear more details from Bob who is leading this strategic initiative.  Now let me share with you our evolving capital deployment philosophy. We are a strong company. We generate significant cash flows. With the key assets and capabilities in place through recent acquisitions to drive long-term growth, we do not see large acquisitions in the next few years. Our focus is on improving our performance and integrating businesses we have acquired. As a result, we plan to return a majority of our future cash to shareholders. This morning, we announced a 70% increase in our dividend to an annualized amount of $0.68 per share. This demonstrates confidence in our continued ability to generate strong cash flows. Starting next year, we are further aligning management's long-term incentives with increasing returns on invested capital. Now, Bob, will provide further analysis, and then we'll take your questions. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. Revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 2.2% above the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was a $1.18 compared to $1.13 in the prior year. Third quarter results include a benefit of $0.05 per share in 2011 and $0.08 per share in the prior year, associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. Adjusted earnings per share for the 2011 third quarter exclude $0.10 per share associated with restructuring and integration costs, which are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release. The acquisitions of Athena and Celera contributed about 3% to revenue growth in the quarter. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues were about 1% above the prior year and about 1.5% below the prior year before the contributions of Athena and Celera. Volume in the quarter was 1.2% below the prior year and compares to the approximate 1% decrease we saw in the second quarter. The market in terms of estimated position office visits continued to decline in the quarter and was down 6% compared to the prior year. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 5% in the quarter compared to about 6% last quarter. Revenue per requisition was 2.1% above the prior year with the improvement due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. Base revenue per requisition has remained relatively stable sequentially throughout the year. Organic revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, products and healthcare IT, grew about 8% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues was 18.3% compared to 18.1% reported in the prior year. Restructuring and integration costs, which are detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release reduced the reported operating income percentage by 1.4%. These costs totaled about $27 million in the quarter and compared to our earlier estimate of $20 million. The difference, principally due to additional costs associated with our plans to close our clinical testing operations in the U.K., which had not been contemplated in the year-over-year estimate.  In connection with Surya's transition, we expect to recur charges in the fourth quarter and early part of next year, totaling approximately $14 million associated with certain provisions contained in his employment agreement. A portion we estimate to be recorded in the fourth quarter is approximately $5 million. Separately, we expect to incur approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. Last quarter, we announced a multi-year initiative. The goal of which is to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of 2014. This effort is in its very early stages, and we are not expecting to realize any meaningful benefits until 2012 with the bulk of the savings to be realized in 2013 and 2014. However, we've made good progress since the last quarter and remained confident in our ability to reach our goal. The opportunities have been quantified and organized into a number of areas with dedicated teams of subject matter experts and cross-functional support. Each team has a very specific charter and financial target. They're currently in the process of developing detailed implementation plans, which will allow us to realize the opportunities identified. Some of the areas around which our teams are organized are as follows: specimen acquisition, which includes all the costs associated with obtaining and transporting samples; client support, which includes billing and customer service; the labs themselves and all the costs associated with operating them; IT and customer connectivity costs; procurement and supply chain; and SG&A both in the field and at corporate. As you'd expect with a large-scale multi-year project like this, some areas are more developed than others. The areas where plans are furthest developed are in client support, and procurement and supply chain. Together, which we expect to provide about 1/3 of our savings. In the client support area, we plan to leverage technology to eliminate manual processes, further standardize our systems of processes, implement more self-service options for customers and leverage a Lean Six Sigma to further streamline activities.  In the area of procurement and supply chain, we plan to further consolidate suppliers, rationalize SKUs, standardize and optimize specs, and work more closely with our suppliers in sharing information and managing costs from design, to manufacture to distribution. Other areas like the labs themselves and specimen acquisition, which we expect to contribute another 1/3 of the savings, are more complicated and will take a little longer. In these areas, we are addressing capacity utilization, including our lab footprint, service parameters, organization structure and supply consumption. The final, roughly 1/3 of the savings, is expected to come from SG&A, including IT. There are several common themes that run through many of the opportunities we are working on. They include standardizing systems, processes and databases; increased use of automation and technology, and centralizing certain activities. In addition, we have performed the comprehensive spans-and-layers exercise and are conducting activity-value analysis across all of our functions, which roll up into cost of sales and SG&A. Where the opportunities reside and what we want to achieve is clear. We are now in the process of finalizing the specific plans and timelines for how we will go about realizing those targets. While I understand that there is interest in specifically how much savings will be achieved in each of the years and what that means to margins, we are simply not far enough along in this effort to provide you much more.  In January, in connection with providing 2012 financial guidance, we intend to provide you with further information in that regard. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6% in the quarter and reflected continued improvement from the prior year. DSOs were 44 days, unchanged from the second quarter. Reported cash from operations was strong at $338 million. For the effective restructuring and integration cost, cash from operations was $360 million. This compares to $330 million reported in the last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter compared to $47 million a year ago. During the quarter, we've repurchased 1 million common shares at an average price of $47.79 for a total of $50 million. We have now completed $885 million in share repurchases this year.  As Surya has indicated, we are firmly committed to drive in increases in shareholder returns. Clearly, the best way to do that is by improving operating performance. And as we've already discussed, we are taking actions to accelerate organic revenue growth and putting in place a more efficient cost structure. We also intend to use our strong cash flows to enhance shareholder value. Now that we have assembled a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities, it is unlikely we will complete any large, strategic acquisitions in the near-term. We will, however, continue to invest in our business in a very disciplined way to ensure we continue to differentiate Quest Diagnostics in an evolving marketplace, but in a manner which should require significantly less capital than recent years. Our investments and growth are likely to focus on smaller fold-in acquisitions, investments in science and innovation in the form of licensing, collaborations and internal development, and investments in technology, which will improve quality and efficiency in our labs and other parts of our business. We plan to use ROIC to guide these investment decisions and are committed to improving ROIC over time. In support of that goal, management and our Board have agreed to make improving ROIC a major component of our long-term compensation program beginning next year. We are committed to increasing shareholder returns and improving ROIC to a framework which encompasses improving operating performance and a capital deployment philosophy, which includes dividends, share repurchases and investments in our business. This philosophy will be grounded in maintaining a strong BBB credit rating, which minimizes our cost of capital and provides us appropriate access to credit in support of our business. In the near-term, this will require us to de-lever to a leverage ratio in the range of 2 to 2.25x.  Given how the company is currently positioned and our outlook for continued generation of significant cash, we believe now is an appropriate time to evolve our capital deployment philosophy to one which commits the majority of our free cash flow we return to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As such, today, we announced the significant increase in our dividend. We are increasing the dividend by 70% to an annualized amount of $0.68 per share beginning with our next payment in January. We expect that the dividend will grow over time commensurate with earnings and cash flows. In addition, share repurchases will remain an important tool for returning cash to shareholders. In January, in connection with providing 2012 guidance, we will provide you with more specificity regarding our capital deployment plans and ROIC goals.  Turning to guidance. We now estimate results from continuing operations before anticipated fourth quarter charges and other potential special items as follows: revenue to grow 1.5%, unchanged from our previous outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share to be between $4.30 and $4.35 on an adjusted basis and between $2.74 and $2.79 on a reported basis. Operating income as a percentage of revenues to approximate 17.5% on an adjusted basis and 13.3% on a reported basis. Cash from operations to approximate $1.1 billion before special items and approximately $900 million after these items. And capital expenditures to approximate $190 million. Our outlook on an adjusted basis excludes the Medi-Cal charge, the first quarter impact of severe weather, restructuring cost in transaction and integration costs associated with Athena and Celera. Footnotes to and aid to the earnings release reconcile the adjusted financial measures with the corresponding GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thanks, Bob. To summarize the quarter, while we see signs of progress in a number of areas, there is still much work to be done. We are focused on increasing shareholder value and improving returns on capital. We are taking a series of actions to improve our forefronts by driving organic growth and significantly reducing our cost structure. In addition, with all our key strategic capabilities now in place with recent acquisitions, we plan to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders. This morning, we announced a 70% increase in our dividend, demonstrating confidence in our continued ability to generate strong cash flows. Together, we believe these actions, over time, will unlock significant shareholder value.  Finally, I just want to say how proud I am of the Quest Diagnostics team of 42,000 colleagues and work they have accomplished. Now that we haven't -- we have established a solid foundation for our future, we have begun a process to transition to new leadership. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dane Leone from Macquarie Capital.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: My first question here is, since you're making kind of a broad change with the management structure for the next 6 months, are there any plans to pursue alternative strategies for Quest as a whole, outside of just the management change?
Surya N. Mohapatra: No, there is no consideration of alternative strategy. As you know, we have worked extremely hard over the last 4 years, so we have really created a company now, which is more esoteric and gene-based testing. So our growth strategy remains the same. We leverage our science and innovation, information technology, and we have a very strong foundation of patient-centric culture for laboratory testing. And on the top of that, we are now building the 4 pillars of disease-focused growth strategy for cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. So I'm very happy, and actually, we are very careful executives and this is the right time to just execute what we have.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Great. And on terms of the sales force reorganization, it's been several quarters since that's been implemented. Outside of just the weaker overall macro environment, when do you think that can actually start paying dividends in terms of growth? It's -- on organic basis, it does seem like Quest continues to grow below the rate of its peers. So I'm just kind of curious on your thoughts of -- when we could actually see the organic growth reaccelerate in the business?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Sure. First of all, I just want to clarify, when we say organic growth, we really mean organic growth. There is absolutely no fold-ins, there is no acquisitions, nothing. So 85% of our business comes from patients visiting the doctors' office. Now year-to-date, if all – office visits are down by 6%. For the year-to-date, our growth is almost flat. So in a way, we are seeing a progress. But also I wanted to tell you that we have, over the last 2 or 3 years, reorganized our sales force to be much closer to our customers. We have a cancer sales force. We have hospital sales force. We've got physician sales force. And that really allows us to know what is happening in the marketplace. But also, I'm pleased to say that we have started seeing progress even in the physician business with the new people and the productivity is growing. It's not where I would like to be, but it is giving in a lot of encouraging signals, and I'm really glad at how they are becoming productive by every month.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just going back to the succession plan, I was just wondering, is there any specific criteria that you guys have in place? Is it some -- is the person you're looking for, somebody within the lab space? Do they have to have previous lab experience? And then any other changes to kind of the current management structure related to the plan?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, succession planning is a very important topic for our Board, and then we talk about that almost -- in every Board meeting, as far as who are the internal candidates, how are they developing and what we need to do for the -- as going forward. But as far as this process is concerned, as you know, the Board has a search committee, and we have a -- I think we are actually adopting a better practice. Usually, the companies are either -- a successor inside and they announce, or they do a search incognito, and look for somebody from the outside and announce. But I think what we have done and our Board is doing is, having a very deliberate short process, which will include internal and external candidates, and drive towards finding the best person who will drive this company to the greater heights in the next -- to 10 years. So I will not really comment on specific specifications, but we'll let you know when the Board concludes their process. But it is a very attractive company, and this opportunity is really a great opportunity for our internal candidates and external candidates.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And I may have missed it, but did you give the contribution on terms of volume and pricing from Celera and Athena?
Robert A. Hagemann: We did not break out the components of volume and pricing, but you should expect, Ralph, that -- the vast majority of the impact did show up in revenue per req because of the mix there. A pretty insignificant impact to volume overall.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just to go back to the $500 million savings plan, obviously margins this quarter, I think, showed some of your progress there. And I know it sounds like you're going to be talking in more detail next quarter about some of that. But I guess, how do we think about the ramp on, kind of, what's left? Is there a way to quantify that either by giving sort of you when you expect to get the full $500 million run rate? So could we expect, sort of, by the end of this year, it's $100 million ramp, and a $300 million ramp and a $500 million ramp? Or is there any visibility you can give us in terms of near-term versus longer-term savings?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, Ralph, as I said earlier, we're still in the very early stages. And we're not yet to the point where we can give you specifics in terms of how much will show up in each year. But as you think about the years, think about very little showing up in 2011. We're really laying the groundwork this year. We expect to have something meaningful show up in next year's results. But we expect that the bulk of it, is really going to come in the 2 out-years. And as we exit 2014, we'll be at a run rate of $500 million and safe.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, and then just my last one, just to clarify, and I think you mentioned this in the prepared remarks, when you say you're not making acquisitions, it doesn't sound like that's -- you're making any deals. Is that -- are you still going to go after small tuck-ins, is that...
Surya N. Mohapatra: As Bob said, we'll always go up to these small fold-ins, and -- but we are saying that there's no major strategic acquisition for -- like we have done in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: So I appreciate your comments regarding the transition. Just curious if you can give us any more insight on, sort of, the timing, why now? And I guess, you, sort of, alluded in your last answer, that it's a, sort of, public transition here. What's the thinking behind announcing that there's going to be a change with still some uncertainty exists as to who exactly is going to take over?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Okay, Tom. First of all, I'm not going anywhere. The reason why the Board and I agreed to do this way because we want to find the best person for this company who is going to drive this company to the greater heights. I have been very fortunate. I came to the company when it was $1.5 million revenue, now it's $7.5 billion. But more importantly, it does become a very strong healthcare company with real focus in disease tests. So we have a lot of capable executive inside, and we have invested in them. But at the same time, we want to really adopt the better practice of internal candidates and external candidates. We have a world-renowned executive search firm, and this process is very deliberate, but very short. I'm going to be the company for the next 6 months to make sure that there is good transition. But the most important thing is that we got so much -- so many important assets and the company is poised for growth. And we want somebody who will be here for the next 7 to 10 years, and that's the reason why it is now.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And is this just looking at your wall and there being some transition there? Or are there any other implications elsewhere in management or otherwise?
Surya N. Mohapatra: No, I did remember in the beginning of the year, we have done some management changes to strengthen our lines of businesses. Cathy Doherty now runs the physician business. Dr. Jon Cohen runs the Hospital business. Dr. Joan Miller runs the cancer business. And we got some other people who are running the lines of businesses, and we are very focused on that. So there is no change in strategy, and neither a change in structure. Now having said that obviously, we have unmatched assets and capabilities, and depending on the person who comes here, he or she will have -- the person who's selected from inside, he or she will have the opportunity to refine. But from my point of view, we have come to a stage where the company has now become an esoteric and gene-based company, major tests in 4 disease categories with information technology, and we need to really leverage those assets and we need somebody who will be in the company for the next 7 to 10 years.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then on the returning money to shareholders, just curious what the thinking of the Board was between announcing a much bigger dividend versus maybe a bigger new buyback program?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Okay. Let me -- first of all, the Board and the management have worked together on the strategy. The 2 important things for the Board is the strategy of the company and the CEO succession. Now over the last 4 or 5 years, we have diversified from a routine laboratory to esoteric and gene-based testing. And to do that, the 4 pillars, we acquired AmeriPath, Focus Diagnostics, and then the 2 other pillars, who are Athena and Celera. And once that is done, we have really completed our strategy for the time being. And so capital deployment philosophy is an evolving philosophy. And the Board and the management agrees that where we are today for at least the next 2 or 3 years, we don't see any major acquisitions. And so as Bob has always said and I have said, that if we don't invest our capital appropriately in acquisitions or we have additional key of cash, we will always return it to the shareholders. And over the years, we have been returned almost $5 billion. So going back to the dividend, we improved it and that does shows our confidence in producing strong cash flow going forward. And also, as I mentioned, that for the next 3 years, we're going to return the majority of our cash to the shareholder in the form of share buybacks. And we'll talk more about this when we do our guidance in January. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: And, Tom, just to put it in perspective, Surya indicated we're going to be returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. When you look at the increased dividend, that represents about 13% or so of free cash flow. So that means share repurchases will continue to be an important element of how we returned cash back to shareholders.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. Last question, if I could, just wondering about the trends of the in-sourcing on the pathology side that had been a headwind for the last couple of years?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, it has been a headwind the couple of years, Tom, and we see that in GI and GU, it has moderated and the down patent is still there. But having said that, cancer is a major area, growth area. And the AP is critical. So we expect -- although the rest of the year is going to be a challenged, but eventually it's going to bode more than the -- we will get the benefit of our very strong Anatomic Pathology franchise.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And, Tom, we're working with ACLA on hopefully some regulatory reform down the road that will stem that trend in in-sourcing. Because we think we'll need that at least a higher utilization.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions. First on the acquisition front, it seems that the contribution from the acquisitions have outpaced your original guidance of 2%. Can you walk us what's driving the strength? And do you expect that to be sustainable?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Ricky, it's actually tracking very closely to what we had guided. Remember that 2% is a full year impact, and we only have those acquisitions in for part of the year. So what you see in the third quarter is a full quarters' impact of those acquisitions, which was about 3%. But again for 2011, where we only have those transactions on board for part of the year, it's about 2%.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So we should expect to see the same, kind of, like trending in the fourth quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, I'm not giving fourth quarter guidance at this point, but there's no reason that it will look much different in terms of the contribution in the fourth quarter than it looked in the third quarter.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then you've really showed very nice margin improvement on both the gross profit and in SG&A. Does the improvement reflect any of the $500 million in cost savings? And if not, what are the drivers?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Ricky, it's a combination of a few things, and I would tell you that it's really not anything from the longer-term program at this point. It's really a result of some of the short-term actions that we've taken to adjust the size of our workforce and reduce costs in light of the volume pressures that we've got. And also in this quarter, we did have some benefit, which -- it's unclear as to whether or not it will continue, but probably 50 basis points or so, associated with the way we treat our supplemental deferred comp plan. You may recall we've talked about this in the past, but losses associated with the investments in that deferred comp plan show up as reduced costs in operating an income, but there is an offset below the line for those losses. So it nets in the P&L, but it shows up in different places. And this quarter, we did have about a 50 basis-point benefit year-over-year from that phenomenon.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then lastly, just following up on the pathology question, I know you mentioned, kind of, regulatory actions that would reverse the trend. Can you update us on, kind of, like your expectation for the timeline on that?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Ricky, we have been working with -- directly in DC [ph] and also with the CLA [ph]. We'd done some studies. We have given some data, but I really don't have any specific timeline. We know that utilization has increased when people are trying to do it themselves.
Operator: Our next question or comment is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is actually Gavin Weiss, in for Lisa. First, I just want it to be clear, that charges related to Surya's employment agreement, those are not included in guidance, correct?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, I know you've talked about AP in-sourcing trends, but maybe -- could you talk about how you think the overall AP market is trending?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, the AP market -- the overall AP market is growing, but the share is shifting a little bit because it used to be the commercial laboratories and the pathologists. And now actually, you have the other specialists like GU, GU and Dharm [ph]. And they are doing the technical components. So I think the total market is still growing with the growth of cancer.
Robert A. Hagemann: And I think you've seen with the recent announcement of the acquisition of Caris by a Japanese firm that, yes, that does point to and reinforces our view that AP is going to be an important and attractive space to be in over the long term.
Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just lastly, you mentioned a benefit plan design in your prepared remarks. Are these programs that will be implemented in the future with health plans? Or are you seeing the effects of these plan design changes now?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Some of those programs are in effect now with some of the health plans, and we are seeing some changes and some results, some improvement also.
Operator: Next question or comment comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess, first off, Surya, is there the potential for you to remain on as Chairman as you transition someone into the CEO role, and then maybe ultimately, the Chairman role? Or are you guys looking to, sort of, effectuate the change of both at the same time?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Gary, again, the Board will consider that. What I have agreed with the Board that once we find a CEO, I will remain as Chairman if the Board wants. But I'm going to be here up to 6 months. And hopefully, we will take less than that to find the CEO. But after April 30, I will leave the company and will not be on the Board of Quest Diagnostics.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and can you guys maybe comment about the transition of Athena and Celera and the integration with the existing sales force and the ability for the current Quest sales force to sell those products?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Yes, Gary, again, you are to visualize our company that the routine testing is the foundation for chronic, and the 4 pillars of this, what I call disease-based focus. They can also consider, like very specialized boutique, advanced esoteric laboratories, whether it is Focus, whether it is another make pathology with Ameripath and Dermpath, or whether it is Berkeley Heart and Athena. So each of them will have and have personalized sales force to meet their customers. But along with that specialist sales force, we also have the general sales force who are selling to physicians and hospitals, and they are to provide lead and provide information and also become the channel for some tests. For example, we had a weakness in women's health, but we introduced, SureSwab, but also we have now access to SMA, through Athena, and we are now gaining some of the accounts back. Same thing is going to happen with the Berkeley HeartLab. They will sell direct, for some of the test results are going to be sold through physicians in the hospitals. So it's actually a double-channel strategy to reach maximum customers.
Operator: Our next question or comment is from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just a couple of questions, could you tell us or remind us, does Athena and Celera have their own commercial contacts or have they been rolled onto Quest contracts?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, but generally, they have their own contracts, in some cases, they operate as out-of-network, and in other cases, we'll be rolling in some of the contracts, particularly on the Celera side, BHL in particular.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it, and Bob, would you care to tell us what percent of the revenue or how much is out-of-network?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, not at this point.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. Okay, thanks. And then in your revenues, the other revenue segment grew, by my calculation, maybe 17% year-over-year, pretty strong growth. Just wondering what was behind that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, well, as I said, the base business grew about 8%. The added growth came from the products portion of Celera, so there's some acquired revenue growth in there. But if you look at the base businesses that grew 8% in that group of businesses, that was principally from the product side of the business as well.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. And I guess, going forward, should we expect a similar type of growth out of the products business there?
Robert A. Hagemann: The products business, we continue to expect, is going to grow at a nice clip. Again, I don't want to give specific guidance for the small components of the business at this point, but we have been very pleased with the growth that we've seen there.
Surya N. Mohapatra: But it's also of a grave strategic importance because there's not a lot of Ivy League companies that have laboratory to introduce products and not a lot of the lab companies. And frankly, there's probably no lab companies who have the IVD capabilities. So knowing that our central team is diagnostic testing and information and services, I expect that some of the LDTs laboratory developed tests is going to become IVD through focused diagnostics in Celera and will become a revenue stream for us.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. And then you said Drugs of Abuse was up 5%. Does your Drugs of Abuse include toxicology screens? Or is it just pre-employment testing?
Robert A. Hagemann: It's principally pre-employment testing, but, yes, a lot of that is tox work, though.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Understood. Okay. And then, just maybe the last question I have is, Surya, could you give us any update on India and maybe just generally how Care360 is performing?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Sure, first of all, about India, we -- as we said that Indian market, the laboratory market is growing 15% to 20% a year. We are growing in India, but it is not to my expectations. So we have a lot of opportunity in the growing market, especially in India to make sure that we get our share. We have started doing some esoteric tests and also some reference tests from India. So we'd still have to do a lot more in India for us to really get our return. As far as the Care360 is concerned, that's doing very well. Not only the Care360 has the laboratory orders and results, but also at the EHR, and we have now got the almost a 3,800 people of adopted hour Care360 EHR. And this again will become a very important element when we move forward to work with health plans and accountable care organizations. ACOs want connectivity. ACOs want analytics. ACOs want informatics. And this is the only company who has not only the connectivity but also content. So again, another strategic asset, which will really help us to grow.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Surya or Bob, you may have mentioned it, but with a CEO search that's under way, is the Board also open to exploring or currently exploring other alternatives possibly to create some value here above and beyond what you've announced today?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, Bob, first of all, the Board is fully engaged to find a successor to me. And as far as any alternatives and other things, obviously, that's something -- the Board looks at it. But at the moment, it is -- the focus is looking for a CEO, not really do any other alternatives for Quest Diagnostics.
Robert A. Hagemann: And, Bob, we believe that executing against what we've outlined, particularly in terms of improving operating performance, will generate some real significant value for shareholders.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Brendan Strong from Barclays Capital.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Maybe first off, Surya, what exactly -- what are going to be your biggest areas to focus over the next 3 months -- next 6 months here?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, nothing changed. We have a company to run, and we have to deliver what we promised. And -- but going back to what are the focus has been to really grow the top line, so that's basically, sales effectiveness and driving the esoteric business, reduce costs. And then the other thing, what we are now focused on, improving ROIC. Those are the 3 things. But I'm going to work until the last day to making sure that not a single business on Quest goes anywhere. It comes to Quest from the market.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then -- look, with this type of a transition, there's often a lot of soul-searching. What do we do really well? What do we not do so well? Is there anything that you would say that maybe you would've done differently in recent years so that you'd recommend the company do differently going forward and that's maybe even a new opportunity at this point?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, again, you're absolutely right. It's not even this transition. Almost every year, we think about what is doing well, what is not going well, what we can do better. But if you know our company, there are 3 words that has driven our company over the last 10 years: it's patients, it's the passion for patients and our desire to grow and our commitment to people. So as far as patients, growth and people, that's not changing. The more important thing is that we have a lot of very capable people in the company, not only at the executives level, but also in the company. And that's why actually, we could take a big jolt like losing the United contract, but recovering. And as far as I'm concerned, that we are no longer a lab company, we are in healthcare diagnostics company. And with a lot of assets, and with a lot of people in the company with new ideas. So I'm pretty excited actually, to see this company and look for a person, both internally and externally, to drive the company. But -- so I don't really, again, we're not going to tie people's hands down wherever the new leader is, but wherever the new leader is, they will -- he or she will be very, very excited about the people and the assets and the customers we have.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right, great. And then, Bob, last question is for you. I know it's hard to give specifics on the $500 million in cost savings. There's always been questions over the year, as to whether or not there's some core differences in the cost structure between you and LabCorp. And I'm just wondering if you can comment on whether or not, at this point, you think there may be some specific differences that you are target with these savings? Or if these savings are more just driven by what you believe are best practices?
Robert A. Hagemann: Likely, there are some differences in the way we operate our business with the LabCorp. But frankly, as we go through this process and we've identified the opportunities here, we're not using LabCorp as our model. What we're looking at are the opportunities we have within our business to take our business to a different level, to do things differently. And the -- I outlined a lot of those. Well, I respect the LabCorp for what they've accomplished. That's not necessarily what we're trying to emulate here.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Bill Bonello from RBC.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Can you tell us who on the Board is heading up the CEO transition search?
Surya N. Mohapatra: The Board is the search committee. And, we have, as you know, we have a leading independent Director. But as the Board itself, it's the search committee.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so in the press release, it said you'd formed a search committee, but there really isn't any separate search committee?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Frankly, it is -- the Board is the search committee. There are 7 people, including me, is 8. So obviously I'm not in search committee, but I'll take part -- I'll participate.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, yes. That was going to be the next question, so you will be an active participant in the search process?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Bill, in fact, my role will be to facilitate and provide all the information. And obviously, I will participate in the search process. And -- but it is the Board's decision. It is the Board's work.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then just one quick follow-up question for Bob, in terms of the sequential, sort of, increase in revenue per requisition growth, is that primarily just reflecting a full quarter of the acquisitions? Or is there anything else that drives that?
Robert A. Hagemann: That is probably the biggest piece of it, Bill. As we indicated, as we got into the back half of this year, we would start to anniversary some changes that were made previously, and we're starting to see some of that as well. As I mentioned, the absolute level of revenue per requisition has been pretty stable x the acquisitions this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashim Anand from Natixis.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: First question is the bad debt expense went down significantly. Congrats on that. I was wondering if you guys can comment on if there has been any payer mix, significant payer mix change, and how should we think about the trend going forward?
Robert A. Hagemann: There's no -- been no significant payer mix change driving the bad debt improvement. If you look at the bad debt quarter-to-quarter this year, it's been relatively stable. We had some quarters last year where we had spiked so the improvement that you're seeing is really the year-over-year improvement, not necessarily sequential improvement. But bad debt and billing is an area that we're constantly looking for ways to improve it. You don't improvement it overnight. It generally takes lots of time and effort, and you start to see small incremental changes over time. And that's really what we've been doing here. We've been applying Six Sigma in the billing and collections area for some time now, and it's one of the areas where I think we have the probably the best examples of how Six Sigma can work to drive continuous improvement. And that's really what you're seeing.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Okay, and in terms of the prospective restructuring plan, would it change your aggressive venture into the developing countries in any ways?
Surya N. Mohapatra: No. As we said that we still do quite a bit of reference tests from -- in international, which includes some developing countries. But our major investment is in India because that's the one which is growing. And we want to be successful there before we start doing any other venture anywhere else.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: Okay, and in terms of non-clinical revenues, they grew significantly. I was wondering if you guys can comment on how the point of care part of that is doing? And also, you don't break out, but if you can generally comment on considering the -- probably it says the highest ever, if I'm correct, how that had an effect on that segments, the total non-clinical segments, gross margins and SG&A?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, just like I said, just to clarify, the non-clinical businesses there, their base revenues grew about 8%. There was additional growth added as a result of the Celera acquisition that brought with it a products business. So that's what drove the rest of the growth there. Within the base business, much of that growth was driven by our products business again, principally the point of care operations there, which have been growing nicely.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Although we call it non-clinical, but remember the reason why we have this, is this is all about diagnostic testing whether you draw blood and bring it into the laboratory or take an instrument to the doctor's office. So it makes sense.
Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division: And finally, HHS, recently proposed about direct patient access to clinical diagnostic tests done in labs. In that regard, it's not a done deal. But I just want you to know how and if you are pushing for that reform? And what is the likelihood that the CLIA/ HIPAA's rule against it might be repealed. And going forward, if it does goes through, assuming that you guys like it, how sales and marketing practices might change in terms of clinical diagnostics?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Okay, and a lot of questions here. Well, first of all, we are a very strong supporter of patient data rights. It is the patient's blood, it is the patient data. The other thing is that we don't believe that you can reduce healthcare cost and improve quality unless we educate people. So we've been working behind the scenes for the people who can make changes as far as giving the data to a patient directly, so that they can be educated. You can you know blood sugar is going up, you know that you're not going to have that donor. So it's all about patient accountability. And those are the patient data rights. We welcome it and we really applaud what the government is doing. We have a connectivity to physicians, and now we have connectivity to patients to our Gazelle Smartphones. So if you have the -- your blood sample coming to Quest Diagnostics, you will get your result in 48 hours. Your doctors get a look at those first. And Gazelle was introduced a few months ago, and now we have 80,000 users using this device to get the results and also use other applications. So again, it's all about providing information -- diagnostic information to doctors, now to the patients. So it's a good thing.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Surya, I think your decisions about capital deployment are really great news for your shareholders. I wanted to just ask a couple of questions here. I think, first of all, when did the search begin? In other words, when did you engage the outside party?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, some of these things, I will not be able to give you, but remember one thing, leadership development and succession planning is a regular work in Quest Diagnostics. So this is not something new, and we -- many times, we have different search firms trying to help us, our executive search firm. So as far as this particular one item, I will not be able to give you the exact date.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, the reason why I asked the question specifically is that I think, Surya, you've indicated throughout the call that it will be a short process. And so it sounds like this has been something that's maybe -- been working behind the scenes for some time. So I just wanted to understand the basis for your comment about why you think it's such a short process? Or is it just that you think 6 months is a short period of time? If you could maybe help define what you mean by short?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Okay. Well, first of all, as we've said that we have a number of internal capable candidates. We also have been working for quite a while to look in at actually how the transition is going to happen. And the reason why I talked about short, because usually when this -- we don't want to extend the period of uncertainty. And so I agreed to be here for 6 months to transition. And we believe that we will find the right candidate for our company. And it's a very attractive company with a lot of growth opportunities. So our goal in working with the executive search company, we believe that it can be done within 6 months.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay that's helpful. And then my other question maybe, Bob, if you could just comment a little bit more about some of the incentive changes that the company is pursuing with regard to management compensation? Just any broad strokes on the framework of how that will look for 2012 and what's changed?
Robert A. Hagemann: We'll have more details later. But yes, I indicated that and Surya did as well. Beginning in 2012, a significant portion of the management's long-term compensation is going to be tied to improving ROIC. What those targets are, and the rate at which we're looking to improve it, yes, there's really more to come on that. But those targets for us, will be said as part our annual planning process.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then the last question I have is, just I wanted to make sure I heard -- something you said earlier, Surya, just about lab benefit and maybe I missed the comment. But is Quest developing its own lab benefit management business? Can you just maybe expand on what you were referring to in your prepared remarks?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, sure. We have a product called QuestNet, and we have that existing for the last 7 to 8 years. And basically, it is a product where we manage and build networks, and manage networks for health plans. And already, we have 2 health plans we are working -- they rely on us to really run their network. And we are talking to a number of other health plans who are interested in such network. It's called QuestNet.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I just -- I didn't hear your comment clearly. So it's not necessarily -- I mean, it's a network on that you've developed, but are you building it into a benefit management company as well? Is there anything -- any broader plan around that? I just want to make sure I understand how you're framing that.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, QuestNet can be expanded. It's not a separate company. It's part of Quest Diagnostics. And it can -- we are working with various vendors to have different kinds of things like pre-authorization. And so it can go into the laboratory benefit management if we wanted, but it is a part of Quest Diagnostics.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First off, I just want to talk about the co-pay scenario out there. I know obviously, there's a lot of legislative events heading in the next couple of months. But how are you guys looking at that in the current situation? I think our Washington folks has said that the buying proposal could be one to take shape and within that, potential for co-pays on the lab side. I'm just wondering how you're managing the risk there?
Kathleen Valentine: Yes, Isaac. This is Kathleen. Clearly, there's a lot, as we know, on the table in Washington as the -- as Congress is working on the debt -- the deficit reduction for the debt-ceiling negotiations. And quite frankly, there's a lot on the table. There's a co-pay possibility that certainly AARP has formally indicated their opposition to. There's a co-insurance possibility, there's certainly reductions in the clinical lab fee schedule, they're being contemplated. So there is a lot on the table. We're certainly working directly, and through ACLA, to make sure that diagnostic testing and Quest Diagnostics is fairly considered in whatever they're contemplating. And we've already provided and absorbed quite a bit of fee reductions from Medicare. So it's really too early to tell. Quite frankly, they're under the gun to get something negotiated by the end of the year, and we're certainly staying close to what's going on there.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Isaac, this is Bob. Certainly, we don't see a co-pay as something that's very attractive, not only for us, but for the people participating in the Medicare program. Essentially, you're shifting cost to seniors in a situation like that, and you run the risk that it would deter them from getting appropriate testing and screening and preventing what might be more expensive procedures down the road. So we don't think it's necessarily good policy. We're trying to make that case very clearly. But also, if there is going to be a co-pay, we want to make sure that it's in situations where it's being collected by the provider that's actually seeing the patient, which is really important.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe secondly, on Celera, I think in the past you guys have touched on the key development capabilities you got from that asset? Wondering if can maybe comment on the progress you're making there as it relates to new products. You touched on, sort of, an interest in becoming more of a diagnostics company rather than just a lab services provider. So how those assets are helping you make that transition would be interesting.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, the reason why we were interested in Celera apart from having a specialized Berkeley Heart Lab, is their discovery capability and also their IVD capability. We have focused diagnostics for infectious disease. And with that, what we bring to our company is how you deal with the FDA, how do you deal with the regulatory staff. Plus the fact, that a lot of tests can be converted into IVD, based on the work which is happening in our laboratories. So when I look at international market or when I look at the hospital market, I really am pretty excited about some of the reagents which we can do through Celera or Focus. At the moment, we're focusing more on molecular diagnostics, which is the top end of IVD. So this will be very important for us when we go towards personalized medicine. And this will be very important for us also as far as getting the benefit of testing in the hospital and international by just sending reagents and not going to have really open up big laboratories to do these things. So it is good. And it is -- we are combining some of the expertise. It's small at the moment, but it has a very bright future.
Robert A. Hagemann: And, yes, Isaac, we're seeing a lot of interest from pharma in our capabilities at this point because they are thinking about companion diagnostics, particularly diagnostics that might have a very broad appeal. It's going to be important for them that there'll be an IVD kit that's available. We can work with them to take laboratory developed test, convert it to an IVD kit, which can then be distributed very broadly and widely. So we're seeing a lot of interest here. And as Surya said, it's small today, but it's an important capability that we think is going to help us as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Gary Taylor from Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: A lot of news today. Appreciate it. A couple of questions. Did I miss the discussion of how the AP business is going? And if I did, I'll just go back and look at the transcript.
Surya N. Mohapatra: No, I think we just mentioned our laboratory AP business guide is still under pressure. And we still believe that the rest of the year we will see pressuring down at the pathology, although GI and GU is moderating. And we are working with the regulators. We have collected some data. Hopefully, we could pursue the regulators to start some internalization. But having said that, AP's a very important component of cancer diagnostics. And once it is moderated, we will benefit from our strong franchise of Anatomic Pathology.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Do you expect you might see growth of revenues there in 2012, or is it still too soon to say?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, we're not talking about 2012, as you know. But it's a very important element of our growth strategy, and AP is certainly growing faster than routine testing. But unfortunately, at the moment, because the TC and PC, we're seeing some internalization.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Two other quick questions. One, I just wanted to -- I've asked this before Bob, it's asking about reporting basis and cash EPS. Obviously, LabCorp went there a couple of quarters ago. And in light of, kind of, re-evaluating a lot of shareholder-friendly things, is there any consideration or any new consideration they might change their reporting basis?
Robert A. Hagemann: Look, Gary, we have no plans to do that. I'm not sure how it's really shareholder-friendly. It's not doing anything to create value. It's just recharacterizing something. The amount of amortization that is associated with our deals is clearly laid out on the P&L. And if people want to calculate that number, they certainly can. But I don't see how it creates any shareholder value.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I don't necessarily disagree with you. I just know it's generally -- shareholders have it liked. But whether it creates value, I'm not sure I disagree with you. Thanks for that. Last question is, on the comment that you would look in the future to return majority of the free cash flow generation to shareholders, dividend versus repurchase, and you did report a sizable dividend increase today, but you still -- your dividend payout ratio is about 10% or 12% of your annual free cash flow. So I guess, my question is, longer-term, what are your thoughts around on what that free cash flow payout ratio might look like or could look?
Robert A. Hagemann: Without giving you specific guidance, Gary, on the payout ratio, what you should expect regarding the dividend is, it will grow over time as we continue to grow our earnings and cash flows. But I'm not prepared to give you a specific payout ratio. At this point, also, the increase in the dividend brings us pretty close to about 13% or so of free cash flow.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. And is there any -- just my last follow-up, when you consider dividend versus repurchase, any top of mind, I guess, rules of thumb or thoughts around how are you going to be skewed? I mean, right now, clearly, much more free cash flow available for repurchase than there is being paid out in dividend. In the future, what are going to be some of the drivers for that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, certainly, yes, as we've said already, we feel very good about the outlook for us continuing to generate your strong cash flows and if we feel good about the ability to increase the dividend at this point in time. And I think we want the dividend to be something that's meaningful. We've done that with this increase. And as I said we expect it to grow over time. And share repurchases give us some added flexibility in that regard. So we want to maintain some flexibility here but we want to make it very clear that we're committed to returning the majority of our cash to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Art Henderson from Jefferies & Company.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Surya, I know you guys have worked pretty hard on getting closer with your Managed Care clients. You've talked about working to control leakage. Can you talk just a little bit more about how that's progressed? Are we still kind of in the very early stages there on what you can do? And maybe if there's anything you can sort of comment on how that's going along would be helpful.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Sure, Art. First of all, I wish it was going much faster than it is going at the moment. Where -- however, having said that, and as we've mentioned, we have long-term relationships with a number of health plans and I think as they evolve to becoming ACO or working with the employers, we are becoming a very strong partner with them whether it is including their latest score or providing analytics and informatics about the utilization or taking the leakage data, which the patients are going to the hospital, and the hospital is 2x or 3x more than the commercial lab and changing the employer benefits. So we are working a number of areas, and we are pleased to see some improvements in this area where the health plans are talking to the employers. And health plans are talking to us and giving us the data to move -- to steer some leakage away from higher cost testing to us. The other question about lab benefit management or lab network, and again, we had QuestNet for almost 7 or 8 years. And we see some more interest now in managed network. We manage hospitals. We manage laboratories. So we will probably see some more work in QuestNet. But I think the most important thing is probably going to be the application of our connectivity with the doctors and getting the data utilized. And when the ACO comes in, then it's all about, actually, accountability of the quality and improvement of quality and reduction of costs. So we are working with them, and we're seeing some progress. But it's a little slower than what I would liked to.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Surya, just to prod at that a little bit more. I mean, why wouldn't commercial payers jump more on this faster? I mean, why are they so leery to, sort of, get on board with controlling this leakage issue?
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, I didn't know I have a lot of friends both in the hospital ACO and also in the health plans. And it's a question of priority. Laboratory testing, again, is still in the 3% to 4% of the total cost. And when the company is negotiating a heart transplant or a rehabilitation center and all those things, laboratory test doesn't come in. But having said that, the diagnostic test is going to play an important role on the total life cycle cost during the hospital stay, and the patient outside the stay. And this is where we come in, and this is where the health plans are getting more interested because they want to know about the patient when the patient is in the hospital, and outside the hospital, and also trying to reduce readmission to the hospitals.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. On the Managed Care contracting front, I mean, you don't have any significant contracts that are up for renewal in the next couple of years, do you? Can you just refresh my memory on that?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Art. This is Bob. We've indicated that all of our national contracts had been renewed for multiple years. We don't have anything coming up either this year or next year. They start to come up in 2013 and beyond. And as I look at the next couple of years, while we always have contracts coming up, whether they'd be, typically a national or regional or a local one, the amount of contracts that are coming up -- the business that's coming up in total tends to be a little less than it would be on average in a particular year for those upcoming years.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Bob, while I have you, was there any, sort of, hurricane impact, weather impact in the quarter? I know Irene hit pretty hard. Was that -- did that end up kind of being nothing, or was there anything that you could talk about there?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Art. The impact of the hurricanes was really very modest for us. As you know, they hit on a weekend, which is a slower time for us. So while, it did have some impact, it was pretty modest to the volumes, and we chose not break it out.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Sorry, one last thing, obviously, I know a lot of thought went into your succession plan. I just wanted to say, thank you for all the good years of hard work. You really did build the company up. So I just wanted to mention that.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you very much, Art. And thank you all, actually. You have supported me over the years. But I'm not going anywhere for another 6 months.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just had one quick follow up on the cost savings initiatives that you're launching here. So I understand that you're going to be at that $500 million run rate, sort of, in 2 to 3 years from now. But if you look at that number, it's sort of a big earnings number, potentially. So is that how we should be thinking about it in terms of how it flows to the P&L over the course of the next 2 to 3 years?
Robert A. Hagemann: Yes, Amanda, as I said earlier, well, I think everybody is anxious to understand exactly how much is going to flow to the bottom line. We're doing this for a number of reasons. One, we see, as we look forward increasing pressure on reimbursement, we see rising cost in some places. And we think we just need to do this to make sure that we can continue to grow our business, to be competitive in doing that and also improve our margins. And at this point, it's premature to give you specific guidance as to what the impact will be on margins. We hope to give you some more clarity around that as we get into January and provide you guidance for 2012. But for right now, it's a little premature.
Operator: Our last question comes from Steven Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The -- I just kind of asked that Medicare co-pay thing for a minute here. It seems like if you think about the mechanics of it, at the end of the day, it would impact just your Medicare book of business, which is a smaller part of your mix, but if you did get a broad Medicare cut, that would seem to, over the course of a couple of years, maybe work its way into commercial pricing, and impact your overall book of business. So I guess just to kind of confirm your views. Have you run the math to say that this co-pay scenario is definitely worse financially than, say, a broad 2% to 4% Medicare cut? And do you -- just to get a sense for how much worse this might be versus -- against the broad cover would be helpful, as to kind of put it into context?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well, look, as you can expect, a broad fee reduction is going to drop down to the bottom line with no opportunity to recoup it. And while we're not in favor of a co-pay for the reasons that I've mentioned earlier, you do have the ability to collect that, particularly if you're in the position where you're going to encounter the patient. As I said earlier, if we do end up with a co-pay, that would be the sort of scenario that would make the most sense. It would be the provider that's encountering the patient that would be responsible for collecting the co-pay. Or that's what we would hope in that regard. But certainly, like I said, with the co-pay, we have the opportunity to collect it if it's a straight fee reduction. There's not much we can do about that.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, there is an industry trade bore that the cost of collecting it could be somewhere like in the $3.50 or $3.60 range, somewhere in there. Could you share that here if because your scale might be a lower cost for you? And what's your thoughts around that number in collecting cost of collecting a co-pay?
Robert A. Hagemann: That sounds like it's a relatively high number at this point. And look, we collect co-pays today, so we've got the infrastructure in place to do it. We know how to do it. And while it would add cost to us, it's something that we're certainly capable of accomplishing. And I've believe for less than what you've just quoted.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and a text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations' Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. We grew revenues and adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter despite ongoing market softness. During the quarter, revenues grew 1.5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.12. While clinical testing volumes decreased 0.9%, revenue per acquisition increased 1.6% compared to the prior year, and we generated strong underlying cash flow. Our growth strategy is to be the leading innovator and provider in the fast-growing esoteric and gene-based testing areas for cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. This complements our large routine level through testing services, enabling diagnostics and monitoring of a wide range of chronic diseases. We continue to focus on growing our genetic, esoteric and anatomic pathology revenues. Demand for our esoteric and gene-based testing continued to grow faster than routine testing, driven significantly by Vitamin D testing, which saw double-digit volume growth in the quarter. However, the rate of growth in Vitamin D testing is moderating. Additionally, ImmunoCAP allergy testing continued to grow. In Anatomic Pathology, we continue to see pressure on volumes from physician insourcing, particularly in dermatology and hematology oncology. However, we have seen some moderation of this practice in other areas such as GI and GU. In cancer testing, we continue to promote our colorectal cancer blood test and OVA1 ovarian cancer test and Leumeta blood cancer test. These tests are proprietary to Quest Diagnostics and all showed strong growth. The acquisitions of Athena and Celera, which closed in the second quarter, will further accelerate our growth in gene-based and esoteric testing. I am pleased these integrations are on track. We are also taking additional actions to grow our business. We have strengthened our women's health test offering. We introduced SureSwab for gynecological infections and are launching Spinal Muscular Atrophy or SMA testing from Athena more broadly throughout our network. We are seeing early successes. We also introduced a new prescription drug monitoring service. We are seeing strong growth in this expanding market for pain management. We are helping citizens to ensure that prescribed pain medications are not being abused or diverted. Turning to sales effectiveness. In some areas, we are pleased with our performance, but we have more work to do. As we have said before, we have completed our sales force expansion, provided them with better tools and enabled them to spend more time with customers. We continue to work with health plans to move business to us from higher cost providers. Additionally, we have created a new Senior Vice President position to oversee all aspects of our core business with physicians, including sales, marketing, operations and quality. Cathy Doherty, who reports directly to me, has a proven track record over her 21 years of experience with Quest Diagnostics, including successfully leading our hospital services, as well as corporate strategy and business development. As regards to our costs, we have been looking closely at our cost structure. In the short term, we are aligning our costs with lower volume levels we have seen. Beyond that, we need to become more agile and efficient in our operation. Today, we're announcing a comprehensive initiative to improve profitability in this competitive marketplace, invest for growth and better prepare us for the substantial opportunity in the future. We expect this to reduce our cost structure by $500 million over the next 3 years and help us reach our goal of 20% operating income. I have asked Bob Hagemann to lead this initiative. Regarding capital deployment, our philosophy comprises the use of cash for growth and strategic advantage, the return of cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. In addition to quarterly dividends, so far this year, we have returned $835 million in cash to shareholders through share buybacks, and we utilized about $1 billion for the acquisition of Athena and Celera. With regards to acquisitions, in the near-term, our interest is in smaller holding lab acquisitions, which will provide access to more customers and be immediately accretive to earnings. Now Bob will provide some analysis on our performance, and then we will take your questions. Bob?
Robert Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. Revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 1.5% above the prior year and adjusted earnings per share was $1.12 compared to $1.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for the 2011 second quarter exclude $0.10 per share associated with deal-related and integration costs in connection with the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, which are further detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release. The acquisitions of Athena and Celera contributed about 2.5% to revenue growth in the quarter, and we're essentially neutral to adjusted EPS. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues, were about 1% above the prior year and about 1.5% below the prior year before the contributions from Athena and Celera. Volume in the quarter was 1% below the prior year and compares to the improvement of 1.3% in underlying volumes that we saw in the first quarter. We saw a further market softening in terms of physician office visits in the second quarter, which contributed to the volume slowdown. Our volume for the month of May was particularly weak, while the months of April and June were modestly positive versus the prior year. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 6% in the quarter, although at a slower rate than the first quarter. Revenue per acquisition was 1.6% above the prior year, with the improvement due to the increased esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera. While our increased esoteric mix is benefiting revenue per acquisition, it continues to be pressured by business and payer mix changes, the Medicare fee decrease which went into effect January 1 and pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions executed in the first half of last year. The business and payer mix changes, which continue to pressure revenue per acquisition, include a further rebound in lower-priced Drugs of Abuse Testing and continued weakness in our higher-priced Anatomic Pathology Testing. Revenue in our Nonclinical Testing businesses, which include Risk Assessment, Clinical Trials Testing, products and Healthcare IT, grew 10% for the quarter. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.7% compared to 19.5% reported in the prior year. Recent investments we have made in sales and service are temporarily pressuring margins, but are expected to accelerate revenue growth and margin expansion over the longer term. Deal-related and integration costs associated with Athena and Celera, which are detailed in Footnote 2 to the earnings release, reduced reported operating income percentage by 1%. The adjusted operating income percentage in the quarter is generally in line with the percentage we built into our earlier full-year guidance, which contemplates improvement in the latter part of the year. We continued to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6% in the quarter and reflected improvement from both the first quarter and comparable prior-year period. DSOs were 44 days, unchanged from the first quarter. Most of the MediCal billings, which had been on hold for the unsettlement discussions, have now been released and collections from MediCal have resumed. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago. Underlying cash from operations was strong. Before the effect of the MediCal settlement payment and acquisition and integration-related costs, cash from operations was $271 million compared to $209 million reported in last year's second quarter. Our strong cash flow provides us with significant flexibility to drive shareholder value. Through the first half of the year, we have deployed a significant amount of capital to enhance growth in revenues and EPS. We completed $835 million in share repurchases, which contribute about $0.15 per share EPS improvement. We completed the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, which bring us unique capabilities. While we are still in the early days of realizing the synergies associated with these important acquisitions, they are already neutral to adjusted EPS and accretive on a cash basis. With these acquisitions now completed, our focus is on small fold-in acquisitions, which will expand our customer base and further strengthen our distribution network. In addition, we will continue to ensure we balance our investments and growth with returning cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Part of positioning us for the future is ensuring that we have a cost structure which enables us to continue growing cash flows and earnings, during not only what we expect to be a long-term period of market growth but periods like we are currently in, where the market may be going through some temporary slowdown due to economic or other factors.  To that end, as Surya referenced, earlier this week we implemented a number of cost actions which we expect will enable us to meet earlier earnings commitments despite a reduced outlook for 2011 top line growth. These actions, which are broad in nature and affect most part of our business, will result in a charge estimated at approximately $20 million, which will be recorded in third quarter results. As you've also heard from Surya, beyond that, we have initiated a multiyear initiative designed to reduce our cost structure by $500 million over the next 3 years. This effort is intended to address continued reimbursement pressures and labor and benefit cost increases, free up additional resources to invest in science and innovation and help us achieve our goal of 20% operating income. This program, which I will directly oversee, will touch every aspect of our business and make us more efficient in both our operations and our general and administrative areas. It will include looking at how we operate our labs and other facilities, and redundant costs across our business and the speed and effectiveness of our decision-making. We've identified opportunities in the cost of testing, the cost of acquiring and transporting samples and in our general and administrative areas. We intend to provide you with more specifics and periodic updates as the program progresses. Now turning to guidance. We now estimate results from continuing operations before the anticipated third quarter charge and other potential special items as follows: revenue to grow 1.5%, this reflects about a 1.5% reduction in our outlook for volume as a result of the market continuing to be softer than our earlier expectations. It also includes about a 2% contribution from the acquisitions of Athena and Celera. We expect earnings per diluted share to be between $4.25 and $4.35 on an adjusted basis and between $2.81 and $2.91 on a reported basis; operating income as a percentage of revenues to be 17.5% on an adjusted basis and approach 14% on a reported basis; cash from operations of $1.1 billion before the effect of the Medi-Cal settlement payment and transaction and integration costs, and $900 million after these items; and capital expenditures of $200 million. Our outlook on an adjusted basis excludes the Medi-Cal charge, the first quarter impact of severe weather, workforce reductions and transaction and integration costs associated with the Athena and Celera acquisitions. Footnotes 2 and 7 to the earnings release reconcile the adjusted financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures.  Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: I guess I was curious if you could maybe give us a little more color on margins and costs. Three buckets, I guess. One, Bob, it seems like the margin guidance for this year has sort of trailed down a bit from around 18% to 17.5% to 18% to 17.5%. So what are sort of some of the pressures this year to the extent if maybe some of these investment sales and things? Can you size any of that so we can get an idea of sort of what goes away or how much better it gets as you get through that? And then you outlined I guess from a high-level some of your initiatives on the $500 million of savings. Is there any way to at least from a very high-level breakdown some of the buckets of expectations in terms of the areas that you're focused on?
Robert Hagemann: Okay, Tom. There's a lot of questions there. Let me...
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Yes, sorry. I'll do them again if you need to. But it's also the margin and cost-related sort of short term and long term.
Robert Hagemann: It's all connected. And what I'll try and do is bridge you back on operating income at least, the initial guidance that we put out for the year, which was approximately 18%. As we got through the first quarter, we adjusted that to 17.5% to 18%, essentially tightened that range a little bit, but still pretty close to where we had anticipated in the first part of the year. And at that point, we're still holding the revenue growth. What we saw in the second quarter, particularly in May, at least in our results, was a further softening in the marketplace. And as a result, we've adjusted our top line guidance now, essentially on the volume side. And as you know, with a business that's principally fixed-cost base, you've got to take a lot of cost out just to preserve margins if you're adjusting your top line. That's what we're doing. You've seen us announce now a charge in Q1. We've got another charge coming in Q3 in connection with the actions we've just taken. And then actually, we're looking longer term at what we can do with costs, and I'll come back to that in a minute. So at this point, we've adjusted operating income percentage down to 17.5%, essentially moved it to the lower end of the range that we had, reflecting the change in volume expectations. And some dilution, some minor dilution from Celera. As I told you, when we announced the Celera transaction, we expected it to be dilutive by an immaterial amount this year, and that's some of what you see in the operating income percentage there. With that said, as we look at where we're at versus the beginning of the year, despite the fact that we brought the top line guidance down, we stayed pretty close on the operating income percentage. And actually, from the beginning of the year, we've raised the EPS guidance at this point. The initial range that we had out there was $4.10 to $4.30 as a result of the share repurchases and the cost actions we've taken. We've been able to up that range to the $4.25 to $4.35 despite the expectations for lower volume. So hopefully that addresses your question on the current operating income percent. With respect to the cost reduction program, just like the last one that we announced several years ago, which that's also one that I oversaw, we provided more information as we went along. And we expect to do the same thing here. We'll give you some progress on how much we've achieved with those -- where those are coming from. But as you think about the areas that you typically think about, right, how we operate our labs and our other facilities, i.e., the cost of testing, we have a lot of costs outside the labs, though. Our network for obtaining and transporting samples is something that we're looking at as well. And additionally, we want to get at the SG&A area. So we're looking at all support functions, much of which sits in the G&A. And we believe that there's some redundancies in costs across our business, which we'll get at. At this point, we're not in a position to provide some more details. We want to socialize this and make sure our employees fully understand it and appreciate it before we start providing more details outside. But we expect to do that as we progress with the program.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Just one thing. On the SG&A, though, you've been investing, you're talking about in sales and service. Is there any way to sort of give an idea of either how much those investments have been or how much you sort of think they sort of come down over time as you're sort of expecting those better margins later?
Robert Hagemann: Well, Tom, one thing I'll tell you is they are investments, so we're not expecting them to come down. We expect the impact that they're having on margins, though, to dissipate as they start to deliver top line growth for us, which we believe they will. But one way to think about it without completely sizing it for you is the increase that we're seeing in SG&A this quarter versus the prior year on an adjusted basis is principally due to the additions of Celera. As you know, Celera was basically operating at a loss before we acquired them. We're thinking about it as a turnaround. There's a lot of SG&A costs there which still needs to come out. We've got quite a bit of it in the first quarter of ownership, but there's more to go. But that's really the driver of the increase in SG&A versus the prior year at this point. We've seen improvements in Baghdad, which is helping that. And then the investments that we've made in sales and service are really offsetting those bad debt improvements.
Surya Mohapatra: Tom, I just want to add one more thing that -- we have done this, and we are good at doing these things. And we will use Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma principles, but we'll not sacrifice patient care or medical quality while we do cost reductions. As Bob said, we're going to look at SG&A, and we'll look at the way we organize and go after this.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Adam Feinstein from Barclays Capital.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital: This is Bryan Sekino on behalf of Adam Feinstein here. Just a quick question on the top line growth of 1.5%. I guess the previous revenue guidance of 2% didn't include Celera. And I guess as now you're including it, is there some, I guess, further deterioration, I guess, in the macroeconomic environment that you're expecting to get to the 1.5% now?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, that's exactly the case, Bryan. We had not included Celera in our previous guidance. That contributes about 1% to the total revenue growth. And what that means is our expectations for the base business now are down about 1.5% from where they were. That's principally all volume-related, and that's really as a result of what we've seen in the second quarter in terms of the further softening in physician office visits.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital: Okay. And as I think about the 20% margin goal, the 3 years, does that assume some kind of improvement in the volume environment? And I guess, is it a margin that you can reach through additional cost cutting if volumes don't improve?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, you've heard us say this before. We need to have some top line growth in order to continue expanding margins. Certainly, this cost reduction program is going to be an important contributor to that, but we would expect to see some top line growth. And certainly, over the period we're talking about, we expect that to be the case. Our long-term outlook for the market is that it's going to continue to grow. Demographics, the pace with which new tests are introduced, the increased focus on early detection and prevention are all things that we believe bode well for this market over the long term. And we think we're very well positioned now with some of the acquisitions that we've done to take advantage of that future market growth, although we are seeing a temporary slowdown at the moment.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: A few questions here. First on the top line. I know, Bob, in the past, you mentioned 2% top line growth that kind of threshold for operating margin expansion. Does this figure still hold or is the bar is higher now?
Robert Hagemann: I wouldn't say the bar is any higher, Ricky. I think we do need a couple of points revenue growth to have sustained margin improvement. And as you've seen, we have not had that sort of revenue growth and that's one of the reasons that we're initiating the cost actions that we are.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then on the pricing side, obviously you've reported an improved metric. What would pricing have been if you exclude the Athena and Celera acquisitions on same-store basis?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, we're not disclosing that, Ricky, because we really don't want to put people in a position to back in to pricing of Celera and Athena because we think that, that is competitively sensitive information. But with that said, the underlying revenue per acquisition has been pretty stable and in line with our expectations. And as we told you, the year-over-year comparisons there start to improve as the year progresses, as we start to anniversary some of the things that occurred last year and the year before.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly on volume. I mean, obviously, your outlook for volume growth has come down. But in your prepared remarks you did mention that you saw weakness in May, where April and June were pretty positive. So what is it that you're seeing out there that makes you more cautious on the second half? Is it the macro environment? Are you seeing any increase in the competitive environment? Or are you just trying to be more conservative, given that visibility hasn't been that great over the last year or so?
Surya Mohapatra: Ricky, first of all, May was not a good month, and we did confirm our guidance in May. But having 2 months of data, we realized that this temporary slowdown is probably going to continue for the rest of the year. So here is what we see. 85% of our business comes from patients visiting the doctor's office. In April to May quarterly data, we have 6% decrease in physician office visits, so that affects us a little bit. Regarding insourcing of Anatomic Pathology, that's 16% of our business. Obviously, that's affecting us a little bit. But then we have some of our health plans. They are changing their membership, and that's also affecting us. So when we look at all those things, just temporary things and we know that we are going to go through these things. But when I look at the long term and the medium term, I feel that we have all the efforts, and we are focused on our strategy of differentiation of making the company more esoteric and gene-based. So we reduced our guidance, the top line guidance, based on the office visits and what is going on in insourcing. And but on the other hand, the acquisitions like Celera and Athena is helping us to increase our presence in esoteric and gene-based testing, which is going faster than the routine testing.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Dane Leone from Macquarie Capital.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Actually, this kind of builds on a previous question, but I'm just curious. When we're thinking about this longer-term cost restructuring that I guess would be targeted around early 2014, you mentioned in the press release that it could kind of get you to that 20% operating margin goal. What type of fundamental revenue growth rate would we really have to see to get to that 20% operating margin goal?
Robert Hagemann: We just addressed that a little bit with Ricky. Certainly, the cost reduction program is an important contributor to that -- achieving that goal, but we do need some top line growth. Yes, we need generally in the range of a couple of percent top line growth to have sustained margin expansion. And we haven't seen that and again that's why we're initiating this program.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: And then just one on the sales force reorganization. Can you just remind us when -- from this reorganization when we should really see productivity ramp?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, as I told you that our sales force expansion is completed, and we are organized with the customer phasing organization so that we can be closer to our customers, whether they are hospital, physicians or oncologists. In some areas, I'm pleased how these sales people have come up. In some other areas, we have much work to do. But I want to also make a comment on our operating income. We had a long-term goal of reaching 20% operating income, and we know that we're going through a temporary slowdown. However, as Bob said, the medium-term expectation of this industry is really great. It has tremendous potential for growth, and we are launching this multiyear initiative for cost reductions. So I am much more encouraged with some top line growth and some reduction in the expenses to reach operating income of 20%.
Dane Leone - Macquarie Research: Great. I guess the underlying question really comes around to looking over the past couple of years where volume growth has been, I guess, somewhat lackluster. I'm trying to figure out what can kind of fundamentally turn that around going forward and I guess that from what...
Surya Mohapatra: Let comment on that. Over the last 2 or 3 years, what we have been doing methodically is moving our business to more gene-based esoteric and anatomic pathology and getting focused on the diseases, which are very important, like cancer, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and neuromuscular disorders. Those are the areas which are growing. Now because of recession and because of Health Care Reform for the time being, we have a lot of personal routine testing and some insourcing going on in anatomic pathology. But we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the fast-growing markets in esoteric and gene-based, and nobody else has the products of the test and the network as we have. So I'm very excited that although the last 2 or 3 years have been lackluster -- but going forward, we are going to gain market share in the areas which are faster moving market.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Just going back to the cost savings number. I guess, first, is that a gross number or a net number?
Robert Hagemann: Help me understand how you think about gross and net, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Sure. Fair enough. Like if I were to just assume that you're able to hold your EBITDA flat for the next 3 years, can I just then add $500 million to that number?
Robert Hagemann: No, that's not the way I would necessarily think about it. Yes we, like every business, have cost increases that we expect to see in salaries, wages and benefits. And this $500 million is a reduction in cost that we'd otherwise have, had we done nothing, essentially. So we'll still see some inflationary increases as we look ahead. But this is going to mitigate that and also provide us additional funds to invest in science and innovation and contribute to margin expansion.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Any sense -- so what's the timing around that? I mean, I know it's a 3-year plan. Is it starting today? Did it start this quarter? Is it starting next year? And is it front-end loaded, back-end loaded? Any guidance there?
Surya Mohapatra: Let me just make a comment, Ralph. First of all, as you heard, we are adjusting our cost based on the lower volume. So we have taken some costs out, and we will take charge in the third quarter. And as Bob said, despite the lower volume, we are still meeting our full-year guidance. So that's short-term cost reduction we do as a part of the business. As far as the long-term cost reduction, we just started the program. And like the last time, we will give you the information as we go on. But like any other cost reduction and efficiency improvement program, some cost savings are going to go towards investment, and some cost savings are going to go towards the bottom line. But again, we have done this before. We can do it, and we will do it without sacrificing medical quality and patient care.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. But just in terms of the timing and stuff, are numbers baked in? Like for the guidance, I'm assuming there's some of that already playing in. Is that fair?
Robert Hagemann: You should assume that what's baked into the current year guidance is you're impacted by the short-term actions that we've taken.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: And then maybe just remind us on the timing of when you comp those pricing pressures from a year ago. Did that play a role at all starting this quarter? Or should we look for the benefits of that starting in the second half or 3Q?
Robert Hagemann: We started to see some benefits of that this quarter, Ralph. But remember, it's not just changes in contract pricing that drove this. A lot of it was mix and that mix shift continues, as we see continued growth in the Drugs of Abuse Testing business and as we see a continuation of the softness on the AP side. Those 2 factors are also contributing to the change in revenue direct year-over-year. But again, we've seen it stabilize, and we feel good about the underlying revenue direct at this point for the remainder of the year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And then just my last one. I just want to put in the context of sort of your -- you talked about your quarterly progression on the volume side with May being sort of worse, and then I believe you said positive for the last 2 months. Is that right?
Robert Hagemann: We saw positive year-over-year growth in the months of April and June.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And I just -- the context, we just got the physician office visit data this morning and in the context of -- the numbers seem pretty weak for June, down over 13%, probably one of the worst months we've seen. So I guess I'm just trying to understand sort of the context of seeing improvement versus those physician office visit numbers...
Surya Mohapatra: Ralph, which data are you looking at today? Is it IMS data or JPMorgan?
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: The IMS data. IMS.
Surya Mohapatra: IMS. Well, you heard from Bob...
Robert Hagemann: Ralph, as you heard from Surya, 85% of our business comes from physician offices. As you start to look at the data, I think it's important to understand what's happening with primary care versus specialist and the like. I have not had a chance to analyze the June data at this point. And while there's a strong correlation overall with physician office visits, month-to-month is not necessarily the best way to look at it. And frankly, we even need to be careful as we look at volume trends within the quarter as well. There's certainly correlation.
Surya Mohapatra: There's certainly correlation, but it's not one to one because obviously if they are down by 4% or 6%, we are not down by that much. And that also shows at least to me that some of the investment we have made in sales and sales force, we are staying close to our customers.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Bill Bonello from RBC.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So I guess I just wanted to go back to this cost savings a little bit more and maybe from a slightly different angle. I mean, going back to the concept that for the last 2.5 years, you've had positive volume growth in one quarter. It seems to me like the critical thing here is to jumpstart volume growth. And I guess, how do we get comfortable that you can take out $500 million of cost and sort of not just create an ongoing problem of weak volume?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, let me answer that a little bit. First of all, $500 million sounds obviously large, but it is less than 10% over the next 3 years. You are absolutely right. The number one item for me is how to increase the volume, and that is one of the reasons why over the last 18 months, we have done a lot of work. For example, the organizer needs organized to be customer phasing because we know that we are going through some personal routine testing, but we also know that gene-based and esoteric testing are growing faster than the routine testing. So we are very pleased actually how we are growing in hospital services and how we are growing in esoteric and gene-based testing. But we also have to grow in the routine testing, and these costs take -- we're going to take out -- we're going to use this Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma principle. And as Bob said, one of the major target that we see and I have is DNA. So we're not really going to take costs out from customer phasing or patient-phasing activities. And I think this is the appropriate target for us, and we will do it in a deliberate speed with growth as the number one goal. And that's why we are saying that a part of this cost savings would be invested in growth. And we are focused on actually growing the top line. If we cannot grow the top line, no cost reduction is going to help us.
Robert Hagemann: Bill, I would also add, too, that it's important for us to make sure that we understand what's important to our customers, and that those aspects of the business are not impacted by what we do here. Certainly, the accuracy and reliability of our testing is paramount there and we expect to continue to be able to differentiate ourselves in that regard. Yes, having a broad testing menu is also very important, and you've seen that we continue to invest in that regard. And as Surya said, SG&A is an area that we're going to spend a lot of time looking at. And for the most part, that doesn't touch the customer.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And just one, not follow-up, but one second question and I'll hang up. And I apologize if somebody asked this and I missed it. But Surya, did you -- have you renewed your contract yet? And can you give us any update on that front?
Surya Mohapatra: I must tell you, the contract is fine and the way they work in contract, and neither party has given any notice of nonrenewal. The board and I are fully aligned, and I'm focused on growing the top line and the bottom line.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin Ellich: I'm just wondering if we could go back to the volume issues. You gave some good detail on the monthly trends and also, you continue to see some pressure on the AP insourcing. Is it all just insourcing to physician offices or are you seeing greater competition from other labs that are really focused on like the Dermpath business?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, Anatomic Pathology is major activities going on in insourcing because this is the way for the practitioners to get revenues. We are working with our trade association to see if we can reduce some of the tests. We are working with some health plans who have not changed reimbursement. But most of the Anatomic Pathology reimbursement, especially now, what we see in derm is going towards dermatologists.
Kevin Ellich: Got it. And then on the managed care side, have you seen any greater attrition out of some of the regional plans like Empire Blue Cross that opened up last August?
Surya Mohapatra: Not really. We work with them and working very closely. As we said, there are no major managed care contracts for renewal. Our relations with managed care organizations are very good. We are working with them with the employers to change the benefit plan to have test coming from higher cost provider to us. We're also working with many managed care organizations on the disease program, and we're using our analytics and informatics skills to help them getting prepared for the future, which may be around [ph] care organizations.
Kevin Ellich: Okay. And then just thinking about your comments about utilization trends and volumes. Yesterday, United made some comments saying they expect an increase in utilization, specifically physician office visits during the back half of the year. That's kind of goes contrary to what you guys are seeing. So just wondering if you could help connect the 2 data points?
Surya Mohapatra: You're getting the same data, many more data than we are getting. We represent 15% of the market, so I consider our numbers are representing what is happening in the market. We really don't know actually, unless -- well, first of all, I cannot comment actually what they see, maybe different kind of membership. But we are assuming that at least to this year, the rest of the second half, we are going to see lower utilization. But if it goes up, everybody is happy.
Kevin Ellich: Sure. It makes sense. And then just maybe switching over to the regulatory legislative environment. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion on potential Medicare lab co-pays, and then the Institute of Medicine came out with your recommendations for preventative screening, I think, yesterday. Just wondering if you had any -- have a chance to look at that, and it looks like it would be an incremental positive for you guys. Any comments?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, at first, Institute of Medicine, I must be honest, I haven't looked at it. But we have looked at all the reports. As Bob mentioned, diagnostics is a very good area and has a tremendous potential for growth not only because of demographics, but also very different tests with a higher specificity and sensitivity. But also we will have 29 million people who will be in this plan. So in the long term and the medium term, diagnostics is the right area to be. And I think the short term, the temporary stuff which is going on is not going to last for long. So I'm very pleased. And Kathleen, do you want to make some comments about the FDA?
Kathleen Valentine: On the Medicare co-pay. We're working with the trade association, educating the administration officials and members of congress on the negative impact, the Medicare co-pay and the considered forms would have on the seniors, as well as the lab industry. And we're looking importantly to remind the folks in Washington that diagnostic testing, laboratory represents a very small portion of total healthcare spending in the U.S., less than 3%. And we've already given up a lot. We're absorbing 1.75% reduction for 5 years. We've got a productivity adjustment that we've agreed to with the healthcare reform legislation over the past last year. So we feel like we've contributed significantly already. We're a small portion of the healthcare spend, and we want to make sure that that's appropriately and fairly considered in wherever they go with the co-pay idea.
Kevin Ellich: Okay. And then 2 quick ones for Bob. Bad debt saw nice improvement of 3.6%. How much lower can that go? And then also, can you remind us if the guidance includes the $0.07 impact from weather in Q1?
Robert Hagemann: Well, with respect to bad debt, I'd certainly love to see it go lower, although we're not prepared to put guidance out there. But if you think about one of the positive impacts of healthcare reform in addition to further volume, it should be to help reduce the bad debt over time because a significant portion of that has to do with uninsured patients. So I would be hopeful that over time, we could see that continue to come down as we see more and more insured patients. With the other part of your question, Kevin?
Kevin Ellich: Oh, the EPS guidance, that includes the $0.07 impact from weather in Q1?
Robert Hagemann: It's adjusted out. So if you look at the Footnotes in the earnings release, you'll see all the things that are adjusted out to arrive at the adjusted guidance.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America.
Robert Willoughby: Bob or Surya, I guess if I were a critic, I'd look at another $500 million in cost cutting on the heels of some of the initiatives that you've completed to date. It kind of calls to like some tardiness maybe in getting at some of these inefficiencies. I guess I'm not clear what new opportunities are your really addressing, cutting SG&As. I mean, you just sound like that you should have maybe gotten your arms around years ago.
Surya Mohapatra: Robert, this is Surya. First of all, you are right that some of the costs we could have taken out as we bought some other companies and integrated. But one of the things that we have been doing is actually going towards more esoteric and gene-based, and we have been investing some of these things. Now we have 4 or 5 esoteric laboratories. We also are looking at what is happening to the routine testing. And over the last 4 or 5 years, we have now learned more about how to run the laboratory more efficiently and more on the lower cost. We have used some automation as we have reduced to the cost before. So when we look at it again, this $500 million sounds really big. But to be perfectly honest, it's less than 10% over next 3 years. So we do cost reductions all the time, but again, we are going through another concerted effort to look at what is happening with the routine testing business. As Bob said, how much money we spend in logistics, how much money we spend in DSC and phlebotomy stand. We feel that $500 million is a good target for us, and this will give us some money for investment and will give us some money to meet our operating income goal. Bob?
Robert Hagemann: Bob, as Surya indicated, look, we get smarter each year about our business and what we can and can't do. And certainly, I think that the customer constraints that we have in terms of what we can do with our cost structure we've learned more about over the last several years as we've taken costs out. And I think I have a better view as to some areas that we can go after now, which we previously thought may have been off limits.
Robert Willoughby: Will there be any change in your international expansion strategy or current international focus?
Surya Mohapatra: We will maintain our current international focus, and mainly it is actually in India because that's where we're investing. We have some business in Mexico and some business in -- a small business in U.K., and we're looking at that. But mainly it's the investment in India, which remains the same. And you say it's a medium-term investment, and it's moving. But it is a very slow progress. But that's all.
Robert Hagemann: It's also still a pretty modest investment.
Surya Mohapatra: Yes.
Robert Willoughby: And just lastly, your dividend payouts are down year-over-year actually with some of the share buybacks. You anticipate moving that higher here to enhance the appeal?
Robert Hagemann: Bob, that's something we look at periodically with our board. Over time, we would expect that the dividend payout would grow commensurate with earnings and cash flows. But it's something that we look at over a longer period. And again, we evaluate it with our board on a periodic basis.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: You said there will be a $20 million charge in the third quarter. Is that a severance charge or is that something separate?
Robert Hagemann: That's principally associated with severance, Gary.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then just to stay on the cost cutting, is there any way you could sort of compare and contrast maybe the new initiative to the previous $500 million initiative? Is it more focused on one area than another?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I think we're probably going to have more focus on SG&A this time around. Not that we didn't address SG&A as part of the last program, but I think we want to take a harder look at that. And additionally, as I said, I think we understand our customer constraints better, and that's going to free us up to do some other things.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Is there going to be a bigger IT component of the focus on the cost cutting or streamlining this time around?
Robert Hagemann: IT certainly an element of it.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Will it be a greater element than previously or is just sort of in there with everything else?
Robert Hagemann: I wouldn't say it's greater or less. It's an important piece of our spending. It's also important in terms of the way we deliver our service to our customers, and we want to make sure that it continues to be something that we do very effectively. But we do think that there's opportunities to further reduce cost there as well.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then I think you've talked about it, but just to clarify on the revenue per requisition, the weakness. It sounds like it's primarily a mix issue. And is there anything like we saw last year in terms of pressure on the commercial pricing or extension in contract changes that's incremental this quarter or that you foresee throughout the rest of the year?
Robert Hagemann: And just to clarify a little bit, Gary, as we think about mix broadly, it's the esoteric mix contributed by Athena and Celera that drove the improvement in revenue per rec this year. And the base business is where we've seen sort of the negative mix as we've got growth in the lower-priced Drugs of Abuse Testing business and the continued challenges on the AP side of the business, which is higher priced. With that said, the base business, the underlying revenue per rec continued to be pretty stable, and we don't foresee anything that would cause that to change dramatically this year.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: I just want to go back to the volume guidance. It's actually worse than the back half of the year versus what we've obviously seen the last couple of quarters, and this is coming at a time when I guess, theoretically, sales productivity should be ramping up from some of the initiatives you made in sales force. So I guess I just want to go back to your comments to just understand what's really changed in your mindset. You've said that there's some Managed Care membership churn. You cited the AP weakness and the continued trends in the physician visit, and I guess the new comment will just be around the health plan membership churning because the other 2 issues have been with us. So what's really changed, I guess? Is there something very different that you're seeing in the utilization environment? Can you just help us think about that in the context of your sales force that should be ramping and more productive in the second half of the year?
Robert Hagemann: Darren, this is Bob. Let me answer part of it, and I know Surya is going to want to comment on the sales force aspect of it. With respect to the change in guidance, while we don't provide guidance for revenue per rec and volume, I would tell you that our expectations for full-year volume have been reduced principally as a result of what we've seen. That doesn't necessarily mean that the volume that we expect in the second half we expect to be worse than the volume that we've experienced in the first half. The point was our expectations for the full year have changed principally because the market is softer than we expected when we first put volume guidance out there.
Surya Mohapatra: And as regards to the sales, as I mentioned, that in some areas, we added 100 people in different areas: cancer, diagnostics, hospital sales and physician sales. In some areas, I'm pleased that they have come up to speed. In some areas, we still have much more work to do. But as Bob said, that is basically the change in outlook in the beginning of the year, what's going to the office visits versus now.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: And just as it relates to AP, I mean, is there any updated comment you could provide around trends? I think there was a period beginning mid last year where the message was that you saw a little bit of a moderation in the insourcing trend. Is that still the case? Or I see what you said in your prepared remarks, but has there been a negative shift there?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, I think Anatomic Pathology is a very important aspect of cancer diagnostics, and that's not -- the demand for Anatomic Pathology is not going to go away. What is changing now that we saw in the beginning, as I mentioned, that there is more insourcing with GI and GU and that is moderated. And now it's going through a little bit of dermatologist and hemato-oncologists. I think all I can tell you is that the rate of internalization may have decreased a little bit, but we're still expecting this year we're going to be challenged. But again, this is a temporary challenge when you consider cancer is an unfortunate disease which is growing, and there's a lot more diagnostics required with the therapy. So we feel that we are positioned appropriately, and this is going to flatten out. But we are expecting the rest of the year that we will still be challenged in AP as far as the insourcing. It may not be as bad as last year, but still it is challenged.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: So Bob, it was down 10% last year roughly. Is it tracking kind of in the upper single digits decline? Is that the way to think about it?
Robert Hagemann: Darren, we haven't disclosed that, and we try not to provide too much guidance on the components of the business, again, obviously for competitive reasons. But we have been making it pretty clear that, that business continues to be soft.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then my last question here is just back to the $500 million initiative. I'm curious just to know how involved the board was in developing that, and what the range of options were that you had on the table in the board discussion around a cost initiative. Maybe just enlighten us a little bit about how that process developed, if you could.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, this is a very interesting question because I don't comment on the board discussion. But obviously, if the board and the management are aligned, all of us will now be doing these things. The ultimate goal and the one which I am focused on and also Bob and my management team is to grow the top line and the bottom line and we have to do what we have to do to run the business.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Just to follow up on Darren's outsourcing question. Can you talk about dermatology, rather? Is there another or other areas going forward that you could see outsourcing take off? And we've heard some noise about it in [indiscernible] commentary for example, that could maybe drive the next wave. Or is it pretty much the last feasible area? And then I guess another question there is on the regulatory side, any updates on just the model in and of itself and the sustainability?
Surya Mohapatra: As regards to the flow, any molecular diagnostics and any flows under there are very complicated tests, and I think that will be less insourced than just the histology. That's what we see. And the advantage for a company like us is to combine clinical pathology, anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics and that's how we still do the business with us. So I think the main insourcing is going on with the specialties for histology rather than molecular diagnostics, because it's a pretty complex thing to run and maintain.
Kathleen Valentine: And the effort legislatively, Amanda, we continue to work hard to educate the folks in Washington on the issue. It's active, it's very active, but it continues. There's nothing of significant note yet, but we continue to work very hard with our trade association.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And then in terms of Celera and Athena, it seems like those 2 transactions or deals sort of are in line with your expectations in terms of the revenue that was added. I'm curious and it may be too early at this point, but now that they're kind of internalized, do you have any updated perspective on the opportunities for top line synergies? And then how much of that piece is contemplated in your guidance?
Robert Hagemann: Well, certainly, as we told you when we acquired each of those businesses, we think that there's significant opportunity to accelerate their growth as part of being Quest Diagnostics, in terms of making our infrastructure and network available to them or connectivity or patient service centers or sales force, just access to the physician and hospital customers that we serve. And we feel very good about that opportunity, and we're executing against that now. Surya mentioned SMA, we're feeling very good about how that's progressing at this point, and our excitement about both of those deals continues to be very high.
Surya Mohapatra: It's going to give us a pipeline of products. We didn't have SMA and with Athena, it's going to grow across the network. And same thing will happen with Celera and BHL, we'll provide our physicians some of the unit product BHL provides and some of the IVD products Celera provides. So we are pretty excited about our recent acquisitions.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. I guess just last one, and I think people have asked this different ways. But just some of your comments on the sales force side, you mentioned that it's going through well, but there's work to do. Could you speak to some -- is that specific area where there is work or that's just a commentary on the macro environment?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, when you are bringing in some new people that you are adding to the industry, people are different. It takes time for them to learn the business, learn the industry and at the same time we have some macro environment. So that's one thing. The second thing is we -- in some areas, people have come up to speed, and they are really meeting their quota. In some areas, we have to fully train them all, and we have to refine. But this is a process in which the sales force have pretty much improved. However, having said that, I'm glad that we have done these things because we are getting prepared for whenever there's an opportunity, we will be there before anybody else.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: So you're not seeing, other than outsourcing, a change in the competitive environment in one particular area?
Surya Mohapatra: No. Well, first of all, this is still a very competitive marketplace. Many of our customers and even our competitors, whether they're hospitals or whether they're commercial labs and other stuff, we win in some areas and we have lost in some areas. As I mentioned, that we introduced SureSwab. Women's health is a large business for us, and we had weakness in that product offering. And now we plug that weakness by introducing SureSwab and SMA. So we take competition seriously. And in some areas, we have lost some accounts to competition, and we are going after those accounts.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Steve Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: I'm just trying to piece everything together on the volumes, a lot of commentary, obviously. Can you just comment on how you see your overall organic volume trends in 2011 year-to-date versus the overall independent lab market volume trends?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, as we look at our organic volume growth year-to-date, it's relatively flat. Again, we can point to physician office visits as an indication. The other thing I would point to is as we look at the volumes that come in to our esoteric testing facilities from reference labs, i.e., they're customers but they're also competitors, we see those down as well. I think that there's clearly a softening in the market, which is impacting volumes. And that, we believe, is the principal contributor to what we've seen in terms of the softness here.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Right. When you say flat, you mean flat with the market. So you think your volume trend is in line with the overall independent lab markets. Is that what you're trying to say?
Robert Hagemann: Again, it's hard to say. There's not good data available on the market. We look at the data points that I just referenced here. And relative to those, our volumes seem like they're performing as you would expect overall. Well, we still think that we have opportunity to improve our performance. It seems as though it's relatively consistent with some of the broader market indicators that we see out there.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: There was a comment in your prepared remarks about gene test growth moderating. Can you talk about it?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes. I think that's actually -- I made a comment about Vitamin D, although it grew double-digit, but the rate of growth is moderating. So Vitamin D testing.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: Can you give us a percentage overall either on Vitamin D or just overall genomic and esoteric testing, what the growth was this quarter year-over-year? And what your -- if the moderating of any of that growth is a longer-term trend, does that push off your goal of getting up to a certain percentage of your overall clinical testing as a percentage?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, we really don't give any particular test or a particular component. And the reason why I made that comment is because obviously everybody knows that Vitamin D has tremendous growth over the last 2 or 3 years, and it is appropriate for us to really tell you that although it is growing, it is not growing at the same rate as before. As far as our goal of being the leader and provider in gene-based and esoteric testing, that does not change because one goes down, one may come up. And as I mentioned that we introduced a number of other tests which are going from a small base whether it is colorectal, whether it's OVA1, whether it is SMA. So the pipeline is good. We have a good number of tests in gene-based and esoteric testing, and I feel pretty encouraged that, that market is growing faster than the routine. And we have been investing, and we'll continue investing that area to take advantage of the fast-growing market there.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: So do you expect that to be about 40% of overall testing at a certain point?
Surya Mohapatra: At the moment, it's 36%. And again, we have not given any set goal. And as you know that what is esoteric today, may be routine in 3 or 4 years.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: Right, right. Lastly, are there any big Managed Care contracts that are coming up for renewal either in 2011 or beginning of 2012 that we should be aware of?
Robert Hagemann: Anthony, some of our largest, many of our largest contracts go past 2013. There's always contracts coming up every year, but some of our largest ones are now locked in for long periods of time.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. So anything that's over like 5% of sales is not until 2013?
Robert Hagemann: As I said, some of our biggest contracts are locked in. I don't want to get into specifics.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Kemp Dolliver from Avondale Partners.
B. Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners, LLC: Great. Just a follow-up on the Vitamin D commentary. Do you think that the slowdown in Vitamin D testing is a function of some of the recommendations or at least media attention in the last few months, noting that there's probably not the need to test as many patients or to test them as frequently?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, I think -- well, first of all, the rate of growth in Vitamin D has been tremendous. So you cannot really continue with that rate of growth. So that's number one. Number two, I think there will be continued positive and negative, but I think what you are seeing is actually just the rate of growth. And the early adopters are slowing down.
B. Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners, LLC: Okay, super. Second subject is looking into next year. I know you're not giving guidance, but it looks like based on the June CPI that Medicare under the clinical lab fee schedule could be slightly up next year versus the reduction you took this year. Does that look about right, right now?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, that would be good, wouldn't it?
Robert Hagemann: That is correct. The CPI which is used as the basis for the adjustment next year, I believe, was 3.6%. That will be reduced by a productivity adjustment and then the 1.75% that was a give back as part of healthcare reform. That productivity adjustment still has to be finalized. There are some estimates out there that it'll be about 1.2% or so. When you do the math, that gets you down to about 2/3 of 1% increase potentially in the Medicare fee schedule. And that's going to be relatively immaterial amount to us, although certainly better than a reduction.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, if there are no more questions, I would like to say in closing, in the quarter we grew revenues and adjusted EPS and started the integrations of Athena and Celera. We announced short-term cost actions and are embarking on a multiyear initiative to improve our profitability. Diagnostic testing continues to have tremendous potential for growth. We are the clear leader with unique assets and value, and we are building on our strength and focused on execution. Thank you all for joining us on our call this morning. Operator?

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we make forward-looking statements with respect to both Quest Diagnostics and Celera Corporation. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. In connection with Quest Diagnostics' tender offer for the common stock of Celera Corporation, Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiary have filed with the SEC a tender offer statement on a schedule TO, including the offer to purchase and related documents. Celera has filed with the SEC a tender offer solicitation recommendation statement on a schedule 14b-9. You are strongly advised to read these documents carefully because they will contain important information. Those materials and all other documents filed by Quest Diagnostics and Celera with the SEC will be available at no charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.   A copy of our earnings press release is available and a text of our prepared remarks will be available in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. This was an important quarter for Quest Diagnostics. We completed our acquisition of Athena Diagnostics and established a leading position in the neurology diagnostics market. We also announced our proposed acquisition of Celera to further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular testing, as well as molecular diagnostics products and discovery. These transactions position us well for the future.  In this quarter, we returned $835 million to shareholders through share buybacks, immediately enhancing shareholder value. Our testing volume continued to improve, and we increased revenues. Our earnings were down, and we took actions to reduce our cost structure accordingly. During the first quarter, revenues grew 1% to $1.8 billion on 2% volume growth. Adjusted earnings per share were $1, and cash flow was $161 million. I will update you on our progress after Bob discusses the financial results. Bob?
Robert Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. Revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, about 1% above the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $1, compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Adjusted 2011 earnings per share exclude $0.14 per share associated with the following items: $0.05 charge for workforce reductions; $0.02 for costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions; $0.07 impact of severe winter storms.  Our Clinical Testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues, were slightly above the prior-year level by 0.3%. Volume in the quarter was 2% above the prior year and reflects the continued and steady improvement we have seen over the last several quarters.  There are two important dynamics to understand relative to our volumes. First, due to the number of business days in the quarter, we estimate the year-over-year comparisons benefited by approximately 1%. Secondly, while we experienced severe weather last year in the first quarter, which reduced volumes by an estimated 1.1%, this year's storms had an even greater impact, affecting volumes by an estimated 1.4%. As such, weather unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparisons by 0.3%. After considering these two items, the underlying volume grew an estimated 1.3% versus the prior year and reflects continued improvement. Drugs of Abuse Testing volumes have continued to rebound and grew about 11% in the quarter and contributed modestly to the improved volume trend.  Revenue from acquisition was 1.7% below the prior year and a little over 1% below last year's fourth quarter. While year-over-year revenue for acquisition continues to benefit from an increased mix of gene-based and esoteric testing and increases in the number of tests ordered per requisition, this benefit continues to be offset by some business and payer mix changes, the latest Medicare fee decrease of 1.75%, which went into effect January 1, and the pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions executed in the first half of last year. The business and payer mix changes, which continue to pressure revenue per requisition include a further rebound in lower-priced Drugs of Abuse Testing and weakness in our higher-priced Anatomic Pathology Testing.  Revenue in our Nonclinical Testing businesses, which include Risk Assessment, Clinical Trials Testing, Point-of-Care Testing and Healthcare IT, grew 7% for the quarter versus the prior year. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues was 16.3%, compared to 18.1% in the prior year.  The special items, as detailed in footnote 2 to the earnings release, reduced the operating income percentage by 1.6% in each year. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was below the prior-year level, is consistent with what we expected in our full year estimate, which contemplates improvement in the latter part of the year.  In the quarter, we took further actions to reduce our cost structure resulting in a charge for workforce reductions. The benefit of these actions will show up in future quarters. As previously shared with you, we've also made recent investments in sales and service, which are temporarily pressuring margins, but which we expect over the longer term will result in accelerated revenue growth and a return to margin expansion. We continue to see solid performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2% in the quarter, comparable to a year ago. DSOs were 44 days, unchanged from year end. The temporary hold on MediCal billings has added about 1.5 days to our DSOs.  Cash from operations, which is generally lowest in the first quarter of the year, was $161 million and compares to $239 million in the first quarter of last year. The difference is principally due to a larger increase in accounts receivable compared to the prior year and the timing of interest payments. Capital expenditures were $39 million in the quarter, compared to $40 million a year ago. Over the last few months, we have deployed or announced plans to deploy a significant amount of capital to drive growth in revenues and EPS. In February, we repurchased 15.4 million shares from GSK for $835 million, and as a result, increased EPS guidance by $0.15 per share. In the quarter, we announced agreements to acquire Athena and Celera, committing net capital of about $1 billion. The Athena transaction closed in April, and we expect the Celera transaction to close later this quarter. Each acquisition is expected to contribute about 1% to revenue growth this year and, excluding charges associated with the transactions, are not expected to materially impact our EPS. These acquisitions bring us unique capabilities in key areas of discovery, development and licensing, proprietary test offerings and specialty sales capabilities, which we expect will be important drivers of our future revenue and earnings growth. The permanent financing to fund our recent capital deployments was raised to a very successful $1.25 billion bond offering last month at attractive rates, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. Before I discuss guidance, I would like to note that we have no further update on the status of our litigation with respect to the California MediCal program, other than to indicate we have extended through May 2 our interim agreement with the state, which provides for the temporary suspension of MediCal billing. Turning to guidance. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, as we have previously indicated, in considering how 2011 will unfold you should generally think about our earnings comparisons to 2010 being more favorable in the back half of the year, as the year-over-year comparisons become less challenging.  We expect results from continuing operations before future special items as follows: revenue to grow approximately 2%, reflecting a 1% increase from the impact of the Athena acquisition; earnings per diluted share to remain between $4.25 and $4.45 on an adjusted basis and between $4.11 and $4.31 on a reported basis; operating income as a percentage of revenues to be between 17.5% and 18% on an adjusted basis and between 17% and 17.5% on a reported basis; cash from operations of approximately $1.1 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $220 million.  Our outlook on an adjusted basis excludes the first quarter impact of severe weather, workforce reductions and costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions. Footnotes 2 and 6 to the earnings release reconcile the adjusted financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures. Now, I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks, Bob. I want to update you briefly on the progress we are making on some of the initiatives we have shared with you previously. As you have heard, we have seen steady improvement in the volume trend. Over the past year, reported Clinical Testing volume growth has gone from negative 2.6% in the first quarter of 2010 to 2% positive growth this quarter.  We are making progress although there is much more work to be done. We continue to focus on promoting our genetic, esoteric and anatomic pathology tests. Demand for our esoteric and gene-based testing continued to grow at a faster rate than routine testing. The growth was driven largely by Vitamin D testing and testing for blood cancers, particularly our Leumeta family of blood tests, both of which had double-digit volume growth in the quarter. We have announced our service to hospital customers. We have reduced turnaround time for esoteric testing and deliver commercial excellence. This has helped drive growth in our Hospital business. Anatomic Pathology Testing continues to be impacted by physician insourcing. During the quarter, we saw a moderation of the downward trend. Athena Diagnostics became part of Quest Diagnostics after the end of the quarter, establishing us as the clear leader in the rapidly emerging neurology testing market. We assume some physicians will realize significant benefits from the transaction, including greater convenience and access to a broad range of innovative tests for neurological disorders. We announced our proposed acquisition of Celera to significantly strengthen our leadership position in the discovery and development of molecular diagnostic products and services. We will gain immediate access to Berkeley HeartLab, Celera molecular products and a strong pipeline of biomarkers for the future. We are pleased that the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period has expired, and that we resolved a number of the shareholder lawsuits related to the transaction. We look forward to completing our $8 per share all-cash tender offer and adding Celera to the Quest Diagnostics family. With reference to sales, we are seeing steady improvement in our volume trends. Our sales organization continues to enhance its effectiveness and, as we indicated previously, we have completed the expansion of our sales force. As regards to costs, in the first quarter, we took actions to reduce expenses, which we are closely managing to improve operational efficiency, while maintaining a superior customer experience. With regard to capital deployment, we have taken strong actions to demonstrate our commitment to use our cash to drive growth and increase shareholder value. We are building our position in the marketplace. We were recently honored with the prestigious Edison Award for innovation for our Simplexa molecular diagnostic testing platform on the 3M Integrated Cycler. We also are proud to be one of FORTUNE's World's Most Admired Company for the fourth consecutive year.  In closing, trends and testing volume continue to improve, and we increased revenues. We took steps to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. We are on track to meet our expectations for the year. And the Athena and Celera transactions enhance our position for the future, and we're excited about the opportunities. Thank you. We'll now take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Thanks for all the color. Just two quick questions. First one was on revenue. I think, sort of organically, you're looking for about 1% for the year, Bob. It was about 1% in the quarter even including the weather impact. So can you just talk about how you sort of think about the balance of the year relatively speaking?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, Tom. I would point out, as I said in the prepared remarks, that we did get the benefit of about 1% simply because of the timing or the number of business days that we had in the quarter. So you need to factor that in as you're thinking about the year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Okay, so you're really looking at it as more flat in the first quarter?
Robert Hagemann: Up slightly.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Right. But then weather hurt you by a bunch. So I guess, if you'd sort of adjust for the weather, it still makes the rest of the year look somewhat with a conservative bias. I don't know.
Robert Hagemann: Again, Tom, what we indicated was the impact of weather this year was 1.4% to revenues. Last year, we had severe weather as well. It was 1.1% impact. So really, we only had, on a year-over-year comparison, a drag of about 0.3% due to the weather.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Right, okay. And then just on margins, I think your prior EBIT margin guidance was for around 18%. It looks like on an adjusted basis, your 17.5% to 18%, I'm assuming that excludes some of the items but includes the benefit of Athena, which I thought was higher margin. So can you just help us understand sort of the adjustment in the EBIT margin guidance for the year?
Robert Hagemann: And as we've indicated, Athena certainly does carry higher margins. It's a relatively small business compared to our total business. We're adding, this year, about less than $100 million in revenues at very high margins. So it's a positive impact certainly, but it's not going to be significant in the year simply because of the size of the business relative to the total company.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: And the adjusted number, that excludes weather and charges and everything?
Robert Hagemann: Correct, it does. And that's all detailed in the footnotes to the earnings release.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Right. So my only question was why did it seem to come down a little bit? Even though Athena's small, it would have helped. What else is going on there?
Robert Hagemann: It's a refinement of our thinking. I would tell you, though, between 17.5% and 18%, it's still approximately 18%, is the way we're thinking about it. We've just got a little better visibility coming out of the quarter now.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: All right. Don't want to slice hairs, just want to make sure I understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So first of all, Bob, if you can just clarify your comments on the quarterly progression of guidance? I know you talked about EPS ramping up in the second half of the year. I think consensus estimates for the second quarter are about $1.19, right now, versus the $1.07 that you reported in the second quarter 2010. So are you basically saying that we should temper our second quarter EPS estimates, and just model a bigger pickup in the second half? Is that how we should understand your comments?
Robert Hagemann: Ricky, I'm not trying to give you any specific guidance for any one particular quarter since we don't do that. But as we've stated now for a while, you should expect the comparisons in the latter part of the year to be more favorable than in the first part of the year. Some of that's reflected, certainly, in the operating income. It's lower in the first quarter. We expected that. There's a number of things which are impacting the year-over-year comparisons besides just the changes in contract pricing, which were negotiated last year. But there are some things on the cost side, which we expect will have bigger benefits in the back half of the year. Some of the actions that we took in Q4 and again in Q1, will start to show up in the latter part of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then when we really think about Q2, about the operating income expenses, I mean, is commodity pricing -- is the increasing commodity pricing having some impact in the business that we might have underestimated previously?
Robert Hagemann: No, Ricky. I think while there's certainly some pressure on commodity pricing, that's not significant. Most of our supply contracts have fixed pricing for extended periods of time. And we're not seeing a lot of pressure there. We are seeing some pressure, certainly, on fuel costs, but that's a small piece of our total costs, less than 1%. And that's not having a significant impact. It's really, as I indicated earlier, the fact that some of the actions that we've taken, we expect to show up in the latter part of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly, I think you talked in the press release about the incremental hit to your -- to the EBITDA lines from the weather. What was the incremental hit on the revenue line?
Robert Hagemann: It was about 1.4%. That's laid out, again, in the earnings release. Last year, the impact of weather was about 1.1%. So again, the year-over-year impact is an unfavorable, roughly, 0.3%.
Kathleen Valentine: And Ricky, the impact is laid out in footnote 3 in the press release. You can see some details there.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So the question then, the increment -- when we look at those numbers, at the incremental, at the revenue hit and the operating hit, it implies a pretty significant incremental margin on that business.
Robert Hagemann: Absolutely, and we've said that historically. When we lose volume as a result of weather, in those situations we're really not adjusting our cost structure. Folks are still coming in to perform whatever work is there. And in many cases, we actually even pay overtime to get folks out, so that they can pick up specimens, get them into the laboratory et cetera. And what you see in terms of the incremental operating income relative to that incremental revenue is very consistent with the way we've historically calculated it.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Right. So we calculate around 70-plus percent, which is similar to 2010. The question is: once volume comps improve, is that what we should see in the upswing? Or is there a reason why the margin is going to be so high, that incremental margin that you lose is so high versus the incremental margin that you pick up?
Robert Hagemann: Again, when you lose volume as a result of weather, there's very little ability to impact your cost structure for other than the purely variable costs. And as I said, in some cases, you're actually adding some costs to procure that work and get it into the lab because of the challenges associated with logistics and the like. So the incrementals on volume loss to weather are much higher than you'd expect on any sort of incremental work that we get elsewhere.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Can you quantify that delta?
Robert Hagemann: Other than to say it's significant, no. But you should expect that on incremental volume, we do see strong drop-downs because, again, depending upon where it's coming from, in some cases we have, obviously, the cost of testing, that's incremental, but then you have the additional logistics costs, the additional processing costs, et cetera. But historically, if you go back and you look at our business and you look at the incremental margins associated with top line growth -- go back, I don't know, in the last 4 or 5 years when we were realizing low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, we were expanding margins in the range of 0.5 to 75 basis points.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: First question is, Bob, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the sources of the volume strength in the quarter. I guess a two-part question here. One is can you quantify any impact that we would've seen from the new laws related to the healthcare reform? And then secondly, can you give us a little color in terms of how the quarter progressed? Should we, by chance, see any type of sequential strengthening throughout the quarter?
Robert Hagemann: Bill, yes, I think it's very difficult to quantify any potential impact as a result of healthcare reform and the fact that folks aren't obligated to pay copays and deductibles for certain preventive care. With that said, I think over time that should be a net positive to us. But at this point, it's very hard to attribute anything to that. I'm not sure necessarily that, that's driving physician office visits which, at the end of the day, probably is the biggest driver of our volumes. The data that's out there says physician office visits were down versus the prior year. Not as much as we were seeing last year, but they were down about 3% based upon the IMS data, at least through the first two months of the year. And as we look at the volume, I would tell you that there's no specific area I can point to other than I did indicate that the Drugs of Abuse Testing business has started to grow again. But that's having a modest impact on our overall volume growth. And really, what you see when you take out the impact of weather and you take out the impact of the number of the revenue days, it is kind of a steady improvement from what we've seen, and it's a steady improvement that's been going on now for about five quarters or so.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: And so, Bob, just to follow up there. So there's no specific comments that March is stronger than February, February is stronger than January? Or should we read into that, that's exactly what's happening because we are seeing this gradual improvement?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, I'm reluctant to provide any information on a specific month because one month does not make a trend, and we typically stay away from providing any information on an individual month.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: Understood. And then secondly and lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on the bad debt comments? Certainly, we do expect to see it up a little bit on a sequential basis first quarter over fourth, but if memory serves, it looks like it just made the largest jump since about 2007.
Robert Hagemann: Well, the bad debt is pretty consistent with what we saw last year at this time. And the first quarter typically has higher bad debt than in any other quarter, simply because of the fact that there's more billings directly to patients for deductibles and copays.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: I just wanted to go back to kind of the margin squeeze and specifically on the SG&A side, obviously, we saw a tick up there. Any more color into what exactly's driving that? I know you already mentioned some of the logistic issues around weather. But anything more into that in terms of that SG&A number?
Robert Hagemann: Ralph, as we've indicated, we've been investing in sales and service, which, ultimately, we believe are going to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. We've expanded the sales force. We're improving service levels. Some of the service levels show up in cost of sales. Some of it shows up in SG&A. But those are things that we expect are going to have positive impacts to us as we move forward.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Correct me if I'm wrong, the run rate from the end of last year though, is there incremental? Because I thought you had said you guys had sort of made the investments and now is that starting to play itself through or are there more than what we had seen the back half of last year?
Robert Hagemann: Most of it is the case where it's just playing itself through. Although, I will tell you that we did make some incremental investments in the quarter in new test development and the like, much of that's showing up in cost of sales now.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And then just to kind of go back to some of your pricing comments before. So it sounds like it's pretty straightforward in terms of the contract updates, obviously from last year. We knew Medicare -- the Medicare cut was coming through. And then you just talked about the business and payer mix changes in terms of the drugs of abuse. So there's -- I mean, there's nothing else driving that slightly-weaker pricing. And so I guess my point is, should this be sort of a temporary issue that we start to see the growth in sort of pricing in the second half of the year? And maybe just help us understand exactly when do we anniversary those contract updates?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. We certainly expect that the year-over-year revenue per rec comparisons will improve in the latter part of the year. The anniversary of the pricing changes made in connection with contract changes last year really start to anniversary in the second half.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And then just my last one. You had mentioned the AP business. I may have missed it. Did you talk about -- you said that there was a moderation in the downward trend, but can you give any more color on what the actual declines were?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes. I did mention that. The Anatomic Pathology business is a key business for cancer diagnostics. We saw last year it was impacted through the physician insourcing, which is still continuing. However, the rate of insourcing has moderated over the last few months.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. But no hard numbers around that?
Surya Mohapatra: No.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Just a follow-up question on the sales force, and you talked about this a little bit, but I'm just curious. You've talked about the upgrading of the sales force sort of offset by some reductions. Can you provide a little more color on how that's impacted your business or your market share to date or how you kind of expect it to going forward? Or is it too early at this point?
Surya Mohapatra: Amanda, first of all, it is early. But let me give you some rationale behind what we have been doing. We saw, last year, the number of patients that's going to the doctor's office have reduced. And you know 80% of our business comes from physicians' office visits. And I mentioned last year first quarter, that we've continued to upgrade our sales force, and also we are building specialty sales force. Now, getting sales force means providing new tools, providing new training, trying to bring people to a particular knowledge level. But also, we have now have specialty sales force to be very close to our customers. We have a sales force for Physician business, we have a sales force for Hospital, sales force for cancer. And as I mentioned, through Athena and Celera we'll have specialty sales force for neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease. The reason for doing all these things is because we have invested money in esoteric, gene-based and anatomic pathology to build our competitive differences in cancer diagnostics, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. And these four platforms with specialty sales force is going to be the growth engine for us in the future. So I think the major part of our sales force reorganizing is complete, and now we are executing the strategy. However, as I mentioned, that we see steady improvements in our volume, but it is early to say how much exactly we are getting from the sales force. But as we continue, our belief is that the sales force are going to create the differences and then be reason for our growth.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. Thanks. And then now that you've got Athena under your umbrella, if you will, have you gotten any more clarity on some of the longer-term revenue synergy opportunities?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, nothing more than what we said before. And obviously, Athena, 70% of their revenue is patent protected. They have a lot of tests, not only for neurological disorders, but some of the tests like SMA and MODY, that's going to be useful for the broader customer base. And we are going through our [indiscernible] plan how to really bring some of those tests to the primary care physicians.
Robert Hagemann: And we expect to do that shortly.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. Thanks. And I guess just last one. You talked about pricing trends year-over-year. Any way to get any perspective on sequential trends in the pricing metric?
Robert Hagemann: Amanda, I did give you some indication as to how revenue per rec performed this quarter versus the last quarter. But generally, we don't give guidance for revenue per rec, and certainly not how it's going to perform quarter-over-quarter.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. Thanks, a lot.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Shelly Gnall from Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Thank you. Couple questions. I guess first on the pre-employment drug screening. Can you remind us what the margin on that business, how does that compare to sort of the routine and Esoteric Testing business?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, we've actually never provided specific margins on that, but what we've indicated is it's much lower-priced business. And as a result, carries significantly lower margins than the Esoteric business.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Okay, thanks. And can you update us on what percent of the revenues that is for the company, as of this quarter?
Robert Hagemann: It's generally in the range of about 3% of revenues or so. A much bigger percentage of the volume given the fact that it's much, much lower-priced business.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Would you be willing to share the percent of volume?
Robert Hagemann: It's in the range of 6% to 7%. It's about double the revenue impact because the pricing is about half.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Okay, great. And would you be willing to share how strong the pre-employment drug screening grew? And what contribution that was to volume growth in the quarter?
Robert Hagemann: I did indicate in the prepared remarks that it grew almost 11%...
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Okay. I've missed that. Thank you.
Robert Hagemann: ... in the quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it's contributing about 0.5% to volume growth, which is pretty consistent with the contribution that it's made over the last three quarters or so. So when you're looking at the sequential volume growth, it's not having a significant impact.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Okay. Great. Then I wanted to make sure I'm understanding the incremental margin commentary. So I understood that incremental volumes lost carry a big margin. And am I correct in understanding that incremental margin -- incremental volumes gained also carry a big margin but just not as big because there are costs associated with bringing in that new volume?
Robert Hagemann: That's generally the way it works, yes.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Is it fair to say -- I know you don't want to quantify this, but sort of doubles the company's standard EBIT margins?
Robert Hagemann: Say that again?
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: If you think about the incremental margin on the next patient that comes in the door, the next test that comes in the door, serves twice the operating margin of the company? Is that a fair way to think about incremental margin on new business?
Robert Hagemann: Well, it's a long, complicated answer. But if you're looking at the next rec that came in the door, you'd see a very, very high incremental margin on that. But generally, that's not the way it works. It's a function of where the business is coming from, what territories, what concentration of business we already have there, what the mix of business is, whether it's coming from a new account or an existing account, whether or not it's coming from additional tests ordered on a requisition or it's a new requisition. So all those things impact it. But certainly, we would expect that incremental volumes would have strong incremental margins associated.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Understood. And then just a quick one. I understand you've got a 4-gene urinalysis prostate cancer test under development. Can you give us any update on this test, where it is and whether it's expected to be an important test?
Kathleen Valentine: You threw me off with the name. 4G?
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: The 4-gene.
Kathleen Valentine: Oh, the 4-gene. Okay, yes. It's still in development, Shelley. And while it's in development, we don't have anything to comment on yet. But we're pleased with the progress that it's making. And then when we get to a stage where we have something to disclose, we certainly will do so.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Okay, great. Thanks, very much.
Operator: Our next question or comment is from Bill Bonello from RBC.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just a couple of questions. One is just a simple logistics question. Is there a quarter in which we would expect to see an offsetting impact in terms of the number of days where the business day comparison is unfavorable, year-over-year?
Robert Hagemann: Bill, I don't have this off the top of my head, but generally, the quarters are pretty comparable. They vary anywhere typically between being flat and maybe 0.5% or so in any one quarter. But I think for the most part, the rest of the quarters are pretty comparable.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then at the risk of beating a dead horse but maybe coming at it a different way on this margin question, I just want to understand the guidance maybe a little bit better. Doing sort of simple, back-of-the-envelope math, the guidance seems to imply that operating income is going to be up anywhere from 2% to 5% over the rest of the year, the next three quarters. But on an apples-to-apples basis, operating income was down 10% in Q1 despite the favorable business day comparison. You don't seem to be suggesting that you really expect much in terms of a big uptick in volume. So just trying to understand sort of how we go from a 10% apples-to-apples decline to sort of a 2% to 5% growth in the rest of the year.
Robert Hagemann: Yes. Bill, there's a few things at play there. Obviously, as we get into the back half of the year, the price changes in connection with the contract extensions, which were done last year, start to anniversary. So that has an impact. Additionally, some of the cost actions that we've taken in both Q4 and in Q1 start to give us benefit at that point. And in addition, in this first quarter, we had a number of cost increases versus the prior year, principally related to salaries, wages and benefits, which will not have the same year-over-year impact in the latter quarters.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So on that, if I can just parse that out little bit, I guess I'm what I'm trying to have an understanding is sort of how much of the drag is really just a factor of the pricing and once that comps, most of this decline is made up for, and how much of it is the incremental investment and we've got to hope that you can get some revenue boost to offset that? Not an exact number, but just to give us some comfort.
Robert Hagemann: And Bill, I'm probably not going to completely satisfy you with this answer. But it's really a combination of three things. It's the price changes anniversary-ing as we get into the back half of the year. It's also the investments that we've made in sales and service starting to anniversary as we get into the back half of the year. And it's the impact of the actions we've taken to reduce costs, which will start to show up in the latter part of the year.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Yes, that's a good thing. I sort of missed that part. Okay. And then just a separate question. I know in the past we've asked this about the molecular diagnostics coding initiative. And it seems like, in general, you haven't been particularly concerned about it. I think we asked specifically for Athena and Celera. But just, is there any kind of quantification or further color you can give us on why we don't need to be worried about that? I mean, is it -- in other words, is it that you look at it, and you say, "Gosh, we're just not worried that molecular diagnostic rates are going to come down when they get CPT codes," or is it more, "Look, we only get sort of 3%, 4% of our revenue from stacked codes and so it doesn't matter that much what happens to the rates?"
Robert Hagemann: Well, it certainly does matter what happens to the rates. We get more than 3% or 4% of our revenues from what I characterize as stacked codes. I mean, when you look at what CMS is trying to accomplish, it's really the increase the visibility around what's being billed for. And for those that are billing for more mutations than are necessary or are clinically appropriate to achieve an accurate diagnosis, those are the ones that are most likely to see reimbursement reductions when rates are set. We feel pretty comfortable that what we're billing for is medically appropriate and necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis. And as such, we're not expecting there to be a significant impact.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And even if it goes in the physician's fee schedule and you have a copay, is that just sort of a minimal enough -- Medicare exposure on that is minimal enough that we don't have to get worried about that?
Robert Hagemann: Say again?
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Well, if it goes in the physician fee schedule, you suddenly have a copay that you haven't had on these molecular tests. Am I just to think about that it as, look, Medicare in general is not that good a deal and so Medicare/molecular testing is just not enough to matter even with the copay?
Robert Hagemann: Well, Medicare is about 15% to 17% of our total revenues. I'm not expecting that we're going to see a significant impact to our Medicare revenues as a result of anything that comes out of this.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And then there's one last question. In the proxy, you talked about Surya's employment contract expires at the end of the year. I don't know, Surya, if you can expound at all, sort of on how you guys are thinking about -- well, first of all, if you want to comment on whether that's been renewed. But more broadly, just sort of on how you're thinking about the future in terms of continuing to build out the management team and succession planning and that kind of stuff. How should we be thinking about the future?
Surya Mohapatra: Bill, good question. First of all, we are very fortunate that we have a very strong leadership development and succession planning in the company. I share with the board almost every quarter in a private session about people development. As you know, over the years, we have not only added a lot of gene-based, esoteric testing and anatomic pathology, but also we have acquired a number of key people from various companies. So while I work at mostly at the pleasure of the board, I'm very excited about what we are building, and I have no plans to do anything else, but it's up to the board. But I'm very satisfied with the people we have and the succession planning we have in our board discussions.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And as you get bigger and bigger, would you give some thought to sort of creating a Chief Operating Officer role?
Surya Mohapatra: Sure.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: In just talking about the volume trends, is there any reason that the Drugs of Abuse Testing is impacted by the weather? Or is it also similarly impacted by the weather to the other tests?
Robert Hagemann: Well, Gary, it does have some impact, but generally what we've seen is it's less impacted by the weather than the other business.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And just, out of interest, what would be the reason for that?
Robert Hagemann: Generally, I think what happens is if somebody needs to be tested for pre-employment drug screening, that work gets done, whereas with some of the other work that we get from physician offices, it's lost for good.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then maybe a follow-up question on Athena. With the deal having closed and the progress that you've made in terms of -- on the sales force front, how do you feel about accretion from the deal and maybe any updates in terms of timing and how do you feel about it as you head into 2012?
Robert Hagemann: There's really no update on that. As we indicated, we don't expect it to have a material impact to EPS this year, excluding charges associated with the deal.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Then maybe if I could ask it a little bit differently. What do you see sort as the biggest challenges or the biggest opportunities on the sales force front in terms of eventually driving accretion from the deal?
Surya Mohapatra: I think as I mentioned, Gary, that we are getting closer to the customers. And I know there's a concern in the beginning whether we are investing money in sales is going to pay off or not. But I am very pleased with the way we are driving different customer and business, whether it is Anatomic Pathology or whether the Hospital business or the gene-based business. And now with Athena and Celera, we will increase our customer call points which we never used to call, like the neurologist or endocrinologist and even the cardiac specialist. So again, in the investment, we continue to execute our strategy, and as we move from just a lab company to a diagnostics company, now four different specialty offerings, again I think that will be our growth as we go forward.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Few questions here. First on Celera. You mentioned initially the potential dilution should be immaterial for 2011 EPS once it closes. Just curious how you see things now. Should we still not expect any adjustments to EPS guidance for 2011 for Celera once it closes? Is that still a safe statement?
Robert Hagemann: As we indicated, when we signed the Celera transaction, we expect it to be dilutive this year by an immaterial amount. And until the transaction closes, we don't really have any further update.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. One other quick one on Celera, to the extent you can talk about it. One of the things that didn't really come up on the call last month, just curious how much the potential future royalties from the Merck Phase 3 drug for osteoporosis may have played a role in your enthusiasm for Celera. Was that material in your thought process or is that just kind of a wild card, where you'll take it if you can get but you're not counting out? Just trying to get a sense for how you preliminarily, at least, think about that?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. Without trying to provide any color, certainly we considered all of the assets of Celera when we valued the company. As did Celera and their advisers. Let me take a question off the table relative to this, and that is there's been a lot of question as to whether or not we're going to amend our $8 per share offer for Celera. The answer to that is no. Surya has clearly stated in the past that this is our best and final offer. We think that it's one that fully values all of the assets. As Celera has disclosed, they engaged in a very lengthy process before accepting our offer, looked at a lot of alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, and viewed our $8 per share offer as the best alternative and in their shareholders' best interest. I know that you may have seen that there are some Celera shareholders who had been vocal in their views about the $8 per share offer not fully valuing the company. But I would point out that Celera's advisers considered the potential value of all of Celera's assets in their valuation work. The offer that they got from us was the best one they received after a lengthy process. And there haven't been any superior offers that have emerged in the three weeks since the announcement. And frankly, if the transaction is not consummated, the Celera shareholders run the risk that ultimately they can realize significantly less for their investment than we're offering. If this merger doesn't go through, Celera operating as an independent public company is going to be facing a number of continued challenges. First, it's operating at a loss, and so long-term outlook for the performance of the business has significantly deteriorated. They've got the challenges of serving as an out-of-network provider. And they've indicated their operations were subscale. And while these are big challenges for Celera as a stand-alone company, as part of Quest Diagnostics they're all readily addressed. So we're excited about the transaction, and we're hoping that the Celera shareholders will conclude, just as Celera's directors unanimously did, that the transaction's in their best interest and offers them the best opportunity to maximize value.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. That's helpful. One other just quick one here. I think I'm almost apologetic at this point for bringing this up again. But just when determining the lost revenue from weather, do you count actual days of closed facilities or is it just guesswork? Just trying to get a sense for the quantification process of the lost revenue, in particular, from weather.
Robert Hagemann: Yes, and it's a good question. Essentially what we do is we look at the volumes that come through the door every day compared to what we typically see on that day of the year. We also look at what we believe is normal weather. Because frankly, in our budgeting and the way that we develop guidance, we always assume that there's going to be some storms in the winter. And what we saw last year and this year was significantly in excess of what we'd expect in a typical year. In fact, this year was about 3x what we'd expect in a typical year in terms of lost volume due to the storms. But when we quantify it, we try to play it right down the middle and give you our best estimate as to what we think the impact of weather is, net of any potential rebound that might come in the few days following the storms.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: Bob, anecdotally, what drove the other revenue line item growth in the neighborhood of 7%? And can you give us some of the metrics that are ePrescribing customers and medical record customers at this point, how sequentially that may have built?
Robert Hagemann: I'll give you a little color around the other businesses and then Kathleen can comment on the ePrescribing for you. But in those other businesses, as we've indicated, we've got our Risk Assessment business, our Point-of-Care Testing business, we have a Clinical Trials Testing business. The Clinical Trials business and the Point-of-Care Testing business has showed nice growth in the quarter, but essentially, all of those businesses grew in the quarter and contributed.
Kathleen Valentine: And on the ePre, Bob, we saw -- we now saw physicians order prescriptions and medications through our ePre capability at the rate of about $24 million, annualized. And on the EHR, which as you know, we rolled out last year and it became ECHIT certified in December of 2010, we now have over 2,000 physicians enrolled.
Robert Willoughby: Okay. And maybe a question for Surya. Surya, you've been cutting costs since the changeover in the United contract relationship here. I mean at what point do we have to start worrying here that you're cutting into some muscle here with the further workforce reductions? I mean, how much more can we really go from a cost-structure standpoint there?
Surya Mohapatra: Right. And this is why we have to be very careful actually that we reduce our costs but don't affect our front-line employees and also don't affect the customer experience. Having said that, we learn every year through Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma how to really improve. And we use our size and skills to go after supplies. So I still believe there is room for our margin expansion. And we have not given up our 20% operating income margin as a long-term goal.
Robert Willoughby: Okay. And just, Bob, quickly on the cash going forward, should we assume you chip away at the short-term debt?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. We have some of that actually coming due later this year and some coming due next year. As you can see on the balance sheet, there's a little over $600 million or so that's due within the next 12 months. One of the notes is coming due later this year, and we'll be paying that down.
Robert Willoughby: So retiring, not refinancing?
Robert Hagemann: Correct. As we indicated when we levered up or when we actually announced the share buyback and the two acquisitions, that for the remainder of this year, a significant portion of the cash flow is going to go towards delevering, although we have not ruled out any other potential acquisitions.
Robert Willoughby: That's great, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Brendan Strong from Barclays Capital.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Maybe just a couple of questions here for Surya, just to start off. First off, I was thinking about what you guys have done over the past six months, here. You ramped up acquisitions, so you're making a big investment. You're making an investment in growth there. You're making an investment in growth in terms of spending a lot more on the sales force. I'm just curious, I mean, is there a change in the business that you've seen that you think indicates that now is the right time to be doing this?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, we have been anticipating changes in healthcare reform, and how our company is going to grow both top line and bottom line in the coming years. So over the last four or five years, we've stated our strategies that we're going to invest money in esoteric, gene-based testing and anatomic pathology, and that's what we have done over the last three or four years. And then last year or 18 months ago, we stated also that we're going to build up specialty sales force because we think our future is in science and innovation. Our future is beginning in proprietary products to solve the unmet needs of the four disease area, which is the growth areas: cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders. So what you are really seeing is, to some extent, how we are transforming our company just from a lab company to a diagnostics company, now we're getting into the science and innovation. And we believe for our shareholders and for our patients, this is the best strategy, and we are just executing our strategy, what we said three or four years ago.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then on Celera, it seems like an interesting opportunity for you guys to really boost your growth around cardiovascular testing, and not just from -- obviously from adding Celera in, but from the cross-selling opportunity, from the specialty sales force opportunity. So I guess I'm curious. As you think out, after you -- assuming you guys are able to close on the deal, I mean, how many quarters out do you think you really start to see the benefit? How are you thinking about that?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, again just before I answer that -- although I don't want to use this word, but in every industry there is a time and there is a place where it goes to an inflection point. And we've been working very diligently over the last two or three years to put the pieces. And now with Athena and Celera I feel that we have completed a long-term strategy for getting into the disease stage, and getting into the next phase of what we call the esoteric and gene-based testing, which is basically having a pipeline of discovery, which is really going to fuel our further growth. So we are -- as Bob said, that in our $8 per share offer is the best and final. And I hope and I believe that the Celera shareholders, we believe that is the compelling reason to accept our tender. And as soon as we close, we are in the process of integrating. And hopefully, by the end of this year, we will be able to help some of the issues Celera had through BHL, because some of the operational things is very -- not new to us, and we have done that, so I'm looking forward to that next year is going to be a very different year because Athena is there and Celera is there and also our science and innovation. I'm very, very excited about the assets and capabilities we have acquired. And we want to get back to our growth on top line and bottom line.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Okay. It sounds like what you're saying is you do think that there's going to be some incremental growth around Celera, not just from the revenue you acquire, but incremental growth in the business once you get into 2012?
Surya Mohapatra: We are expecting some of the biomarkers that's in the pipeline is going to help us, not only in Esoteric business but also in Clinical Trials.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then maybe just the last question on the costs, just so I understand it. I mean, in terms of where the costs are coming out of. Are they coming out in the lab, in areas where you just don't need certain costs? And I guess of the SG&A, it's not like we're going to see -- it seems like you've made a big investment in sales, it's not like we're going to see that come down, I don't think. But if you could provide some details.
Robert Hagemann: Well, Brendan, as Surya pointed out, we used Six Sigma to drive a lot of the cost actions that we're taking because as we take them, at the same time, we want to make sure that we're not adversely impacting service levels. And while we're adding on the sales side, on the admin side, I would tell you that I think there's still further opportunity to reduce costs there. We've done things like shared services. There's more opportunities to do that. Six Sigma is terrific not only in the laboratory in terms of streamlining processes, but in a lot of the administrative functions as well. And we've looked to outsource some of those things, we've looked to centralize them, put them in shared services, and we're continuing some of those activities.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the acquisition front, last year was a year where you didn't make many acquisitions, and you said that valuations were high and that was part of the reason. And now you've made two. What has changed on the acquisitions landscape? And is this indicative of -- are these two acquisitions indicative of others that you're looking to do in this size range or anything out there that's in the pipeline that's larger than these two?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, as we said, that any acquisition for us has to fit in strategically and has to make economic sense. And now you folks can realize why we waited to do the things that was really in line with our strategy to get into new platforms. Athena was a new platform for neurological disorders. Celera is a new platform for cardiovascular disease, but more importantly in discovery and development. And we will continue to invest money in these type of acquisitions as we go forward. Now, as regards to other fold-in acquisitions, that is a routine task for us and if it is available at appropriate value, we'll always look into fold-in acquisitions for lab. But our focus remains to build up Quest Diagnostics as the most innovative company by investing in science and innovation.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: And lastly, on the workforce reductions and restructuring in Six Sigma, is that largely complete, all complete?
Surya Mohapatra: No. Again, the whole part behind Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma is continuous improvement. And as we become bigger and bigger, we look for the areas where we can really become more efficient, whether it's through automation or whether it is through the workforce training. And as I indicated, that we have not given up on our long-term goal in the margin expansion. So I feel very comfortable that we have the tools and we have the management to look at and we continuously look at how to really improve our margin.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kemp Dolliver from Avondale Partners.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners, LLC: Just brief questions. Several times you all have referred to investments to improve service. But I'd just like a little more detail regarding where the investments are going. Is it essentially expanding call center headcount? Or what specifically have you been doing there?
Robert Hagemann: Kemp, when I talk about investments to improve service levels, it's principally adding phlebotomists and PSCs and customer service folks. The phlebotomists and PSCs are to address turnaround times, improve customer service in those areas, and obviously the customer service people are aimed towards doing the same thing. But we've added a significant number of phlebotomists over the course of the last 12 months or so.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners, LLC: And where would you say you are in that process? It sounds like you're pretty close to the end.
Robert Hagemann: Yes, I would say we are, at this point. I mean it's something that we're always evaluating, but the vast majority of that expansion should be behind us at this point.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners, LLC: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Gary Taylor from Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Just a few quick questions. One, really just for my edification. When you guys look at seasonality, Bob, and you were talking about the plus 1% business day, are you only looking at Monday through Friday? Do you also pick up Saturday? Because I'm not seeing that when I look at year-over-year. I'm glad you culled it out. But --
Robert Hagemann: Yes, we do pick up weekends, and it's interesting. It's a subtle thing. But what drove it this year is the fact that the New Year's holiday was actually celebrated by most people on the 31st as to the 1st, like it was in the prior year. So that impacted the way we think about the number of business days in the quarter.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Pulled a Monday out of January then, basically. And just in terms of across the week, for example, for different types of providers, there's seasonality across the week. We have a higher waiting on a Monday, Tuesday, versus a Friday. Do you do any of that or are you just looking at a straight week?
Robert Hagemann: We absolutely do.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Is that included in your 1%? So it's a little more...
Robert Hagemann: Yes, all that's factored in.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Got it. Thanks. And then on the sales force expansion that you talked about, have you ever told us how many bodies you're actually adding in sales? Or is the net body count not relevant, it's the net investment that's relevant? Because you might -- these might be some more experienced folks?
Surya Mohapatra: I think I did mention that we have added more than 100 people in the sales organization.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Year-over-year?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: And is that -- I know people -- I'm not sure. I know this has been asked several times. But will there still be -- if we fast forward two, three quarters, is that year-over-year body count going to be even higher than 100 or have we kind of hit the run rate?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, again, we're adding sales force when we have Athena and Celera. But what you ought to really look at is, we want to increase our operating income. We want to really reallocate some resources, so some resources might go from various parts where there's operations or G&A to sales and marketing. But we have to do what is really required for us to increase our market position in the marketplace.
Robert Hagemann: And Gary, as Surya indicated, at the end of last year, and I think emphasized again in his script this time, that the sales force expansion is substantially complete at this point.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: And have you ever told us how many total sales people you have?
Surya Mohapatra: We have not given that number.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then secondly, on the G&A -- I know this was asked and I'm sorry, I didn't entirely understand the question. But G&A up about $10 million. Sometimes that comes down sequentially, but usually you kind of have a modest sequential build through the year. So should we generally look at that as run rate with some modest sequential fluctuation or is there a reason to look at that differently?
Robert Hagemann: Well, certainly, some of the one-time costs that we mentioned are showing up in there this quarter. A little over $4 million of the restructuring cost is showing up in there. A little over $2 million of deal cost is showing up in there this quarter. So those are certainly things to consider.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: But backing those out, which I think we did, it's still up. And I guess it sounds like there's not another big adjustment. Maybe there's some seasonal or quarterly fluctuation, but -- or am I just not going to be able to pull anything out of you non that?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, I'm not going to provide specific guidance around the SG&A percentage by quarter. But again, I would emphasize that a number of the investments that we've been making in sales and service are going to start to anniversary as we get into the latter part of the year. And then some of the increases that we saw in salaries, wages and benefits in this quarter versus the prior year, will be less substantial as the year progresses as well.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: You just haven't tripped up yet on giving anything quarterly. You've been asked a hundred ways, and you've been consistent. So well done. Hopefully, the call's almost over. Last question is on the cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue, obviously that's been running a trend up a little more than 100 bps for a while now, and the majority of that related to the change in pricing from two quarters ago. So my assumption is that year-over-year trend, excluding the impact of the acquisitions, sort of starts to normalize in the back half. Is there something else in cost of goods pressuring that margin item outside of just the pricing change?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, well, certainly the investments that I talked about in service, specifically the phlebotomists and the patient service centers, show up in that cost of sales number. The way you should think about cost of sales is it captures all of the costs associated with obtaining the specimen, transporting it to the laboratory, performing the testing and resulting out the work.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: And the sales investment's in G&A?
Robert Hagemann: Yes.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Sandy Draper from Raymond James.
Alexander Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just one way to come back, Bob or Surya, on the cost cutting, when you look at taking out cost -- obviously six Sigma is a constant thing for efficiency. When you do something sizable, you're going to sort of call out or potentially take some charges for, do you view those cuts as more reactionary relative to some economic or competitive pressures or even if they're that size, you still look at those as a proactive cut as you're seeing things that are going to be potentially happening down the road? Thanks.
Surya Mohapatra: Okay. Well, first for all, most of the cost cutting or cost reduction, we consider that as continuous improvement. Some savings goes towards investing in the company, some savings goes towards the bottom line. So there are some reactionary stuff we had to do when we lost or there is a change in volume. But most of our expense reduction is proactive, and it is a part of the way we run our operations.
Alexander Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: You've deployed a significant amount of capital on some interesting platforms that really don't add much accretion in the first kind of 12 to 18 months. What gives you comfort in these platforms given it's a little bit harder to see the reward? How should we generally think about your M&A strategy, going forward?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, the M&A strategy, in the stated strategy. We told three or four years ago that we're going to diversify more and more towards esoteric and gene-based and anatomic pathology, and that's what we have been doing. And as you know, 36% of our total revenue now is in this high-margin and high-growth areas. Now, of course, there are some market dynamics with the changes, like in anatomic pathology, we are going through a tough time in physician insourcing. Of course, we are working with a trade association for legislative changes in that. So the way we look at it is, to some extent, Quest Diagnostics is going towards creating a new Quest Diagnostics where we are really looking at the four disease areas. And these platforms are the reason why we could say we can serve the cancer patients effectively, cardiac patients effectively , neurological patients effectively, and infectious disease. Now that gives us the competitive advantage compared to other companies in the United States and our competitors. So although it is not reflected in this year and we don't give long-term guidance, but we are very, very excited about the long-term future of the company and our role as the industry leader, what we can do for our patients and what we can do for our shareholders
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. Last question. Do you expect the Horizon contract to be exclusive for 2012? I thought it was coming to term. How are you guys thinking about that?
Robert Hagemann: We don't specifically comment on individual contracts.
Surya Mohapatra: Individual contracts, yes.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: All right. Thank you.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question is coming from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray (sic) [RBC Capital Markets]
Kevin Ellich: I just wanted to go back over the Drugs of Abuse questions, Bob. My understanding is that it has an incremental positive impact on margins when volumes come back. Is that correct? I know it's a low-priced test, but given the high-fixed-cost nature of the business, wouldn't that have an incremental positive impact on the margin?
Robert Hagemann: Any business that is growing is going to be additive to the margins, historically. Right? The point is that, that business carries much lower margins than the rest of the business. So if you're seeing growth there, for example, and we're still seeing the AP business decline, that's not enough to offset it.
Kevin Ellich: Okay. I understand. That's all I had. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Now, I'd like to introduce Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.
Kathleen Valentine: Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs, and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include, but are not limited to, adverse results from pending or future government investigation; lawsuits or private actions; the competitive environment; changes in government regulations; changing relationships with customers, payers, suppliers and strategic partners; and other factors described in the Quest Diagnostics' 2009 Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on our website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. We generated strong cash flow in the quarter and we're encouraged by the continued improvement in our volume trends and the stability in revenue for acquisition. During the fourth quarter, earnings per share were $0.97, unchanged from 2009; revenues are $1.8 billion, 1.3% below 2009 and cash flow was $340 million. For the full year, earnings per share increased 5% to $4.06, revenues were $7.4 billion, 1.2% below 2009 and cash from operations was $1.1 billion. 2010 was a year in which we saw pressure in our volume due to the general slowdown in physician office visits. Despite being negatively impacted by the volume decline, our business remained strong and we grew earnings per share. In addition, we are making progress on a number of key growth initiatives. Looking ahead to 2011, we expect organic revenues to grow approximately 1%, earnings per share to increase to between $4.10 and $4.30 and we will generate approximately $1.1 billion in cash. We are committed to using our substantial cash flow to generate value for our shareholders. Our first priority is to deploy cash to grow the business. In addition, we will deploy excess cash into share repurchases. In 2010, we returned $750 million to our shareholders through share repurchases. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have approved an additional $750 million for future share buybacks, bringing our current authorization to $1 billion. I'll update you on our progress after Bob discusses the financial results. Bob?
Robert Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. Revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, 1.3% below the prior year, and earnings per share were $0.97, unchanged from the prior year. Included in EPS is a $0.03 charge associated with workforce reductions and a $0.03 charge for settlement of certain employment litigation. These charges were partially offset by a $0.05 benefit associated with non-recurring tax items. Clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues, were 1.4% below the prior year in the quarter. For the full year, Clinical testing revenues decreased 1.3%. Revenue per requisition in Q4 was 1.5% below the prior year and has been stable for the last three quarters. For the full year, revenue per requisition approximated that of the prior-year level. Year-over-year, revenue per requisition continues to benefit from an increased mix of gene-based and esoteric testing and increases in the number of test order per requisition. However, this benefit has been offset by some business in payer mix changes and Medicare fee decrease and pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions executed in 2009 and the first half of 2010. The business in payer mix changes, which continue to pressure revenue per requisition, include further rebound in lower price drugs of abuse testing and weakness in our higher priced Anatomic Pathology testing. Volume in the quarter was 0.1% above the prior year and continued to be pressured by the general slowdown in physician office visits. However, the fourth quarter volume reflects continued and steady improvement from the first part of the year. For the full year, volume was off 1%. Drugs of abuse testing has continued to rebound and grew 8.2% in the quarter and contributed modestly to the improved volume trend. Revenue in our Non-Clinical Testing businesses, which include Risk Assessment, Clinical Trials Testing, Point-of-Care Testing and Healthcare IT, was generally in line with the prior-year level for the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, operating income, as a percentage of revenues, was 16.1% compared to 17.9% in the prior year. The charges, which I referred to earlier, reduced the current year percentage by 1%. We continue to make progress in managing our cost structure and driving quality improvements and are evaluating a number of new opportunities to further improve our efficiency and quality. While doing so, we have also made recent investments in sales and service, which are temporarily pressuring margins, but which we expect over the longer term will result in accelerated revenue growth and return to margin expansion. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.8% in the quarter compared to 3.9% a year ago. Days sales outstanding were 44 days compared to 43 days at the beginning of the year. Cash from operations was $340 million and compares to $360 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash from operations totaled $1.1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $69 million in the quarter compared to $50 million a year ago. While we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, for the full year, we repurchased 14.7 million shares for a total of $750 million. Earlier today, we announced that our Board has authorized an additional $750 million of share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1 billion. There is no set time frame for utilizing our current authority and no level of share repurchase in any given quarter will continue to be a function of a number of factors. Acquisitions continue to be our first priority for deploying our cash and utilizing our credit capacity. And we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities. In addition, as we've done in the past, we plan to deploy our excess cash into share repurchases. Before I discuss guidance, I would like to point you to footnote six in the press release, which provides an update on the status of our litigation with respect to the California MediCal program. Given that we are currently in litigation, we cannot comment beyond the information contained in the footnote. In developing guidance for 2011, we have assumed that there will not be a material change in our MediCal reimbursement. Turning to 2011 guidance. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenue to grow approximately 1% before potential acquisitions; operating income to approximate 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximate $1.1 billion; capital expenditures to approximate $220 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, in considering how 2011 will unfold, you should generally think about our earnings comparisons to 2010 being more favorable in the back half of the year as the year-over-year comparisons become less challenging.  Now, I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks, Bob. As you have heard, we are seeing continued improvement in volume trends and stability in revenue per requisition, which positions us for revenue growth this year. I want to update you on the progress we are making on some of the growth initiatives we have shared with you recently. We continue to promote new genetic esoteric and Anatomic Pathology tests, which represents 36% of our total revenues. During the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing revenues grew about 3%, with sales primarily to hospitals and physician specialists. The growth was driven largely by Vitamin D testing, which grew more than 30%, as well as testing for blood cancers, particularly our Leumeta family of blood tests. We have made good progress during our innovative test pipelines in areas of cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease. In cancer diagnostics, we introduced ColoVantage, the first blood test for the detection of colorectal cancer. We also continue to see growing interest in OVA1, the first blood test cleared by the FDA to help detect ovarian cancer before surgery. In infectious disease, our recently introduced SureSwab real-time PCR test for gynecologic infections is being well-received. In addition, our focused diagnostics unit continues to enhance and expand its Simplexa platform with new influenza tests. And in cardiovascular disease, we are pleased at the growing recognition of the value of our AccuType CP test from physicians, patients and health plans. This test helps assess the patient's response to the anti-clotting drug Plavix.  We are making progress with our Healthcare IT. Our Care360 EHR has received an important milestone during the quarter when it was certified for meaningful use. This means that now, our physician customers can qualify for government incentives of up to $44,000 by using our EHR. Since introduced last year, more than 1,800 doctors are using Care360 EHR. Care360 EHR is not just an EHR. We use this platform to run our business and it has attracted a record of more than 40 billion transactions to date. As we exited the year, our customers are using the ePrescribing features of Care360 at the rate of 22 million medications a year, up 70% compared to last year. We continue to invest in our sales organization to respond to a changing marketplace. During the quarter, we continue to add sales people and our sales force expansion is now substantially complete. We have filled a number of key sales positions including hiring new sales leaders for our hospital and physician businesses. With these enhancements, we entered 2011 well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities in various sub-specialties. We see continued interest from health plans and employers in working collaboratively on reducing high costs and out-of-network legislation. As we look at 2011, we have good visibility into health plan pricing with no middle contract renewals. We are driving operating efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we took actions to reduce costs and we'll continue to close the managed cost to align with volume levels and improve our operational efficiencies. We are committed to deploying our cash to drive growth and shareholder value. We continue to actively evaluate opportunities for acquisitions. Apart from holding acquisitions, we are focused on acquiring genetic and esoteric capabilities to further strengthen our positions in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. In closing, in 2010, we strengthened our business in a changing marketplace. During the fourth quarter, we saw a continuous improvement in volume trends and stability in revenue per requisition. Our focus, combined with our industry leadership and positive long-term demographic trends, position us for sustained growth. We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value by effectively executing our strategy. Thank you. We'll now take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Tom Gallucci with Lazard.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: First, I guess just curious about the assumptions behind the revenue growth for 2011. You're talking about investing in the sales force. I think the comps get easier in some cases on volume and on price, so I might have thought it would have been a little better than the 1%. Just curious if you could give us some color on the thinking in terms of the details?
Robert Hagemann: Well, I would tell you that we believe that the guidance that we put out there both top line and bottom line is reasonable. And certainly, we are committed to achieving or exceeding that. And with respect to top line growth, it's also before acquisitions, you should know.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Are there any significant moving parts that you can let us in on in terms of price or volume that we should be thinking about in terms of the positives or negatives for the year?
Robert Hagemann: Well, Tom, as you know, there's a Medicare fee decrease coming, which hit us actually as of January 1, that was 1.75%. Surya commented on the fact that we've got good visibility into our managed care contracts in terms of access and pricing, so we feel very good about that. In terms of physician office visits, we are not thinking that there's going to be a significant change from the level of physician office visits that we're seeing today, i.e, what that means is that we'll start to anniversary the declines that we saw in 2010 and see some stability, going forward. Those are really the key assumptions for us.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: And then just -- I understand you don't want to comment directly on the MediCal. Maybe more broadly, can you tell us why we should be concerned or not concerned about similar sort of issue popping up elsewhere in other states?
Robert Hagemann: What I can tell you is that California is, by far, our greatest percentage of Medicaid revenues. At $66 million a year, it's a little over 25% of our total Medicaid revenues. Every state has slightly different regulations, but we believe we're compliant with those.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: And then just one clarification, the drug testing you mentioned is up. Is that more paid management-driven as opposed to employer sort of-driven or any color there?
Robert Hagemann: No, it's principally employer-driven. Pre-employment drug testing is really what's driving that.
Operator: Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: Does the guidance include the share repurchase?
Robert Hagemann: The guidance assumes that we will deploy our cash, either into acquisitions or into share repurchases. We don't provide specific guidance on the amount of share repurchases that we plan to do in a given year. And that share repurchase authorization that was announced today has no set time frame attached to it as well. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a number of factors that could either keep us in or out of the market in a particular quarter, and the share purchase amount is going to be variable, principally driven by the level of acquisition activity. But the EPS number, you should think of as an all in number where we deploy the cash either into acquisitions or share repurchases, whereas the revenue number is principally an organic number. And that's consistent with what we've down historically.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: And just, I guess, reconcile or clarify, if I just grow revenue 1% and I take an 18% margin, which is kind of what the guidance implies, and I just keep current share count, my numbers get to over 420 as it stands now. Am I thinking about anything wrong? Or there considerations I need to be thinking about when I do that math? It seems pretty straightforward.
Robert Hagemann: No, that gets you kind of right in the zone of what we put out there in terms of guidance.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: And then, you talked a lot about, sort of investing in the business, sales organization, maybe talk a little bit more about that. It seems like you're, by and large, done. So when do you expect to see the benefits? And at this point, should we think that some of the cost pressures that print margins may be help shift in 2011?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. In terms of investments in the business. The areas certainly had been in the sales force to start to drive top line growth and overall improved sales effectiveness. And we're starting to get some traction there. We're not quite there yet because as Surya said, we're now substantially complete in the sales force expansion, but now we need to get those folks up to speed and producing at the rates the we'd expect them to produce once they're fully trained and out in the field. In addition though, we've been investing in the service levels. I think we've mentioned in the past that we've added a number of phlebotomists, whether they'd be in offices or in our patient service centers, and we've opened up patient service centers. And we think it's a combination of both the investments in the sales force and investments in the service levels that are actually going to pay dividends, longer-term, in terms of accelerating top line growth and actually help us into expand margins along with that. And as you think about 2011, think about not anniversarying a lot of those investments until we get into the back half of the year.
Surya Mohapatra: Ralph, this is Surya. Let me just make some comment about our 2010. 2010 was really a difficult year, but also an interesting year in which we saw a new water line as far as the physician office visits are concerned. It was down by 5%. Despite the decline in volume, we are able to generate $1 billion cash and we increased our EPS. So the company is strong, but as far as 2010 is concerned, we also took an opportunity to strengthen our business while we are going through the healthcare reform. So just to tell you, we strengthened and expanded our sales force, we introduced new tests and also new technology like Care360, and we have extended and renewed the managed care contracts for multiple years. So when I look at what we have done in 2010 in a changing environment, I feel very good about 2011 and going forward.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG: And then just my last one. Obviously, there's been a lot of acquisition activity in the space. Can you maybe talk about why you haven't been as active in the space in 2010? And maybe just your thoughts on deals, going forward, is you just said, Surya, your focus area on other areas of the business as a reason maybe why you haven't been as active as acquisitions? Or why has that been the case and what should we expect for 2011?
Surya Mohapatra: The first thing you should assume that we look at most of the acquisitions. But you have seen, over the last 10 years, we have grown both organically and also through acquisitions. So we take acquisitions as the major strategy for our growth. However, the acquisition has to make economic sense and strategic sense. And we are very conservative when it comes to doing the appropriate due diligence. So having said that, what are we focused on? We are focused on acquiring genetic, esoteric and Anatomic Pathology capabilities to strengthen our cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease and another high growth areas. So that's actually our focus. We are not looking at any international acquisition at the moment. And we believe that we have an active pipeline and if it makes sense for us, we will acquire.
Robert Hagemann: Ralph, acquisitions are sort of choppy, right? While we're actively looking at just about everything that comes on the market, you need to get comfortable that a deal makes sense and you do a thorough diligence and ultimately, you need to reach agreement on value. And unless all those things come together, you don't have a deal. But rest assured, we are actively looking at just about anything in our space that comes on the market.
Operator: Shelley Gnall, Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: I was just wondering if you could comment on expectations from the FDA on lab develop tests during 2011? I guess any of your expectations on what we could be seeing from the FDA? And any potential impact on longer-term esoteric growth?
Robert Hagemann: It's still a little too early to tell at this point in terms of what the FDA will do. That's not finalized yet. We do understand though that -- look, they're not looking to slow innovation. They're not looking to take proven and reliable tests off the market, which have been on the market. And we, as a company and as an industry, are going to work through with them -- what needs to happen to make sure that this is beneficial for patients and quality. It doesn't slow innovation and add to costs. And we feel very good about our capabilities in dealing with the FDA. The knowledge that we have and the experience that we have through our Focus division, as well as through our Nichols Institute, puts us in good position to deal with what we believe will just be about anything that comes down the pipe. But it's a little too early to tell exactly what that will be.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: Do you have any sense of when we may hear something? I mean, do you have a sense of whether it's another month or maybe later in the year?
Robert Hagemann: Probably sometime later in the year. It's not clear exactly when.
Kathleen Valentine: And Shelley, our trade associations is in discussions with the FDA, so it is progressing. But we don't have a sense for when during the year we'll get some clarity.
Robert Hagemann: And the other thing, Shelley, to keep in mind is whatever does come out, we'd expect will take several years to implement. It's not all going to happen at once. So that will give companies a chance to adjust to whatever changes might take place.
Shelley Gnall-Sazenski: And then just one quick final question on Vitamin D testing, do you have a sense -- is it too early to tell when that growth, which I know has been good news for esoteric testing growth, do you have a sense of when that could be flattening? Could that be a 2011 issue?
Robert Hagemann: Well, we're expecting it could continue to grow in 2011. Obviously, the rate of growth has to start to slow down as the total revenues in the base of which you're growing becomes larger. But we expect that, that will be a test that continues to grow in 2011.
Operator: Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: I had a question on underlying utilization. I'm curious, you've mentioned that you've seen improvement there. Is there a way to tease out how much of that is related to deductible effects and other people using more tests into the end the year? Or is it really the just underlying improvement?
Robert Hagemann: Amanda, that's an interesting question, one which we look at all the time. And to the degree that there's going to be that sort of phenomena, you would expect it to be in every fourth quarter towards the end of every year. I would tell you that I don't think we've seen anything significantly different in this quarter than we've seen in the past. So it is a little hard to tease that out though because you don't get that sort of information either through your physician customers or through your sales force. But our view is that whatever impact there may have been, is just generally consistent with what we would have seen in the past.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: And then a couple AP questions for you. Last quarter you mentioned that the growth of insourcing has slowed. Is that the same trend that you saw this quarter? And could you even call, sort of a bottom to that, at this point?
Robert Hagemann: Well, I think it's too early to say that there is a bottom, and insourcing is continuing. The rate of growth, we believe, has slowed as we've gone through the back half of the year. But it's a little hard to say from quarter-to-quarter how much it may have slowed. But we are starting to see a trend of that slowing, we believe.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: And then lastly, you mentioned the reimbursement on the clinical lab fee schedule. I'm curious though, on the other side, on the AP side, it looks like there's some positive reimbursement benefit for Medicare in '11. Is that going to be a meaningful tailwind for you or is it just too small?
Kathleen Valentine: Amanda, the net impact from the physician fee schedule changes for '11 will be very negligibly positive for us and it's the impact of the RBU changes, coupled with some of the changes that they made on CF testing, for example. But net-net, it's a slight positive.
Robert Hagemann: And to put it in perspective, our Medicare reimbursement, about 90% of that reimbursement comes off the clinical lab fee schedule and only about 10% come off the physician fee schedule.
Operator: Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: Again, recognizing sensitivity around MediCal, but Bob, if I'm doing the math right, if we hadn't stop billing them, volume would have been a little over 1% in the fourth quarter. Is that the right thing to think about that?
Robert Hagemann: No, Bill. The revenue and the volumes of that testing we performed is in our numbers.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies: And then just a follow-up to the earlier LDT Question, Bob or Surya, any comments concerning the most recent election here? Does that affect the overall pace or perhaps the breadth of what we might see in terms of eventual LDT regulations?
Surya Mohapatra: I think the FDA is interested to make sure that the tests are done appropriately and tested fully and has clinical relevance. And as Kathleen said, we are working with FDA through our trade association and we want to achieve the same as they want, but we just want to make sure that they don't do anything which is going to slow down innovation. If you remember, all these things started because of some genetic tests done by direct-to-consumer ways. So I think it's going to take some time, but we are working with the FDA to do the right thing for the patients.
Operator: Jason Gurda with Leerink Swann.
Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann LLC: Can you talk about the magnitude of the changes that you did with the sales force? I think you had mentioned last quarter that you have added 100 new sales people? If I could get that perspective of the total size?
Surya Mohapatra: We don't break down the total size, but let me tell you philosophically what we have been doing. We are organizing our sales force basically to focus on various subspecialties, whether it be the physicians or the hospitals, whether it is oncologists or whether it's the employers. And what we did over the last year that we have added more than 100 people but also we have provided tools and training to improve the knowledge and efficiency of our sales people and in many cases, we have also upgraded our sales force. So I can't give you the breakdown, but I feel very good about having subspecialties sales force and I feel very good about the new people we have added and we're just waiting for them to get fully trained.
Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann LLC: Another question, we're seeing increased interest in using capitated contracts to reimburse physicians, whether it's in Massachusetts but also with some ACL pilot programs, and I think you'll probably see more of that in the future. But in these contracts, there's a lot more relative to the 90s, there's a lot more focus on various quality metrics. Do you have any sense for whether that leads to physicians ordering more or less tests?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, I don't know the Massachusetts program. But the whole healthcare reform, they started with two things, basically [indiscernible] are quality and then [indiscernible] and then accessibility. So we have a number of discussions going with a lot of health plans, where they want to get information and that's one of the reasons why we have invested money in Healthcare IT and informatics. And we see that going forward, whether it's accountable care organizations or whether it's the health plans or whether it is the physicians, not only they are to practice every day in gross medicine, but the best we've seen in medicine is lab results, lab tests. So we feel that we will be net benefactor of these drive towards quality because we will provide them with the data. And I think the health plans are now getting involved to getting really substantial data, quality data so they can monitor the progress of how they are doing in a particular disease, and how a physician is practicing. And some reimbursement is based on that.
Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann LLC: Is it fair to say it's a little bit too early for you to have actual data on that, however?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes. I think it's a little bit too early. And again, this whole move towards accountable healthcare organization is going to make quality very important and how we provide information is very important. But you know we are keeping an eye on it and it's too early to make any comments, specific comments.
Operator: Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: I have a couple of follow-up questions. First of all on the volume side, I think you said before that you expect no improvement in physician office utilization. So should we think about the volume increase that you've reported in the fourth quarter, is it reasonable run rate for 2011?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, Ricky, as we've stated in the past we don't break out volume or revenue per requisition in providing revenue guidance. And there's a lot of reasons for that including making sure that we manage the business to be profitable business and sometimes walking away from volume that doesn't make sense, et cetera, a whole bunch of reasons. But as you think about physician office visits and you think about our volume, your volume for the year was down about 1% in the quarter. It was about flat, up 0.1%. But physician office visits for the bulk of the year were down around 5% or so. And with those physician office visits being off a pretty consistent level and our volumes starting to improve and show an improvement in trend, we feel good that some of the things that we've been talking about in terms of the sales force, the added focus, et cetera, are starting to pay off a little bit here. And we would expect that we'll see continued improvement as we get into 2011. But remember, we're coming off of a year where volumes have been down. We're coming off of the quarter where revenues are still down versus the prior year. And we need to get to the point where revenues are stable with the prior year and then they start to grow and we expect that as the year progresses, we'll see continued improvement.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And what do you think volume growth will stabilize and without not thinking about a timeline. There's just -- what do you think volume growth where it stabilizes for the industry on a normalized level?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, Ricky, you know this industry, as well as I do. But we usually say that it's 3% to 5% revenue growth with 2%, 3% in pricing or revenue per req and 2% to 3% in volume. I still believe that that's eventually is going back going back to the 5% to 6% growth a year. All the long-term trends are positive. And what we have gone through over the last 18 months, organic growth has been difficult, whether it is due to economic slowdown or due to the healthcare reform. But I'm very positive about 5% to 6% growth in this industry.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And then lastly, just to clarify, does the guidance include the additional SG&A associated with just the sales force becoming effective in picking up, which I assume, will drop just as additional compensation?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, absolutely. The cost of the sales force is fully baked into our guidance.
Operator: Bill Bonello with RBC.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just wanted to revisit sort of how you think about leverage in the modeling. I guess it seems a little surprising that you can maintain EBIT margin, which just 1% revenue growth, especially when you've been adding sales and service headcount. And so I'm just curious, I mean, should we think about as sort of the natural leverage in the model, 1% growth allows sustainable margins? Or are there other cost reductions that are kind of offsetting those adds and allowing you to maintain margins?
Surya Mohapatra: I think that I'm going to pass you on to Bob.
Robert Hagemann: Here's the way I think you need to think about the leverage in the business. At 1% revenue growth, it's really hard to maintain margins or expand them without doing something associated with your cost base. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're continuing to take actions to drive efficiency in our business. We're looking at additional programs to drive costs out of the business. And that's a big driver of why you see margins stable despite the fact that we're only showing 1% top line growth. And what does do though as we continue to take costs out of the system, it really did does help with the leverage, so that as the top line starts to return, we'd expect to see nice incremental margins on that.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And that's exactly where I was heading. Without getting too specific, do you want to give us some sense of how we should think about marginal profitability if volume starts to improve? I mean, it strikes me that this is a high fixed-cost business if you do start to get some volume growth, a lot of that flows through, but...
Robert Hagemann: It absolutely does and you've seen the way this business has performed over the years. I think it's safe to say that there is strong incremental margins on that. But then we've got to decide whether or not we want to reinvest that for future growth. We want to take it all to the bottom line. But you should rest assure that incremental volume and incremental tests, which don't show up necessarily as volume but show up in revenue per requisition, are strong drivers of margin enhancement.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: At then just one last question if I can, on the acquisitions front, you've been pretty clear about what it is you're looking at. Can you just -- I guess, two follow-ups, I mean, should we take from those comments then that you're pretty committed that where you're going to be acquiring sort of within sort of core lab services itself as opposed to something sort of adjacently strategic like a big IT investment or that sort of thing and a follow-up on that?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, we'll always look into the four lean acquisitions whether it’s a regional lab or a hospital outsource [indiscernible]. But our main focus has been in the U.S. We want to further strengthen our franchise in cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and other high-growth areas. We are not looking at any international acquisitions, nor any adjacent space in Healthcare IT at the moment.
Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And would you consider doing a meaningfully diluted acquisition if it was strategically a good bit?
Surya Mohapatra: We'll always look at, as you know, that we have grown the company between both organic and acquisition growth and we will look at the deal and if it's going to provide us a long-term settled value, we'll do it.
Operator: Brendan Strong with Barclays Capital.
Brendan Strong - Barclays Capital: Just calling in on Adam Feinstein on behalf of him this morning. Just maybe first off, I want to ask about empire contract. The contract, obviously, open up the competition during the summer. Any losses under that contract that you've seen through the fourth quarter? Is that sort of what we should be expecting for run rate, going forward or could there be some additional changes as we get to 2011 or on that contract?
Robert Hagemann: Brendan, that was a contract were other providers were added, obviously, when you have additional providers added to contract you'd expect them to pick up some volume, but we have held on to substantial portion of that business. And it's very much in line with what we expected, maybe a little better than what with had expected. So we feel pretty good about that. And it speaks a lot to the value proposition. And you heard me say in the past, we're very comfortable competing for business on a level playing field where were one of the participating laboratories. We usually get more than our fair share. And I think the empire contract fares that out.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: But just in terms of incremental gains or losses there, I mean do you think we've already seen enough time pass for us to have seen the full impact of it?
Robert Hagemann: We're not expecting there to be any significant changes from the level of business that we've retained at this point.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: And then Bob I wanted to follow-up on guidance. I mean, just I'm struggling with the low end of guidance. I mean is it more of a situation where you kind of come out maybe towards the middle, but you're just trying to put some brackets around it and you get higher and lower? Or is there something specific that really gets you down to that lower end of the range?
Robert Hagemann: Look, the guidance here, as we indicate, we used the word approximately and some of these numbers particularly the top line. Approximately 1% has some variability. And as we just talked about a moment ago with Bill, there's a fair amount of leverage in this model so slight changes in the top line dropped down to the bottom line pretty significantly. So I think we've tried to give you as reasonable range as we can at this point. And as I said earlier, we're certainly committed to achieving that or see if as we can.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: On MediCal, I know you don't want to comment on a settlement. But just around that $66 million a year that you generate from MediCal and you still going to be recording revenue from it. Is there a possibility that we see some increased bad debt expense around that in 2011?
Robert Hagemann: I don't know that it's necessarily bad debt expense, I mean, as think about -- it's all going to be resolved ultimately, I believe, as part of the negotiations here. But as we said earlier, we feel that as though we're billing appropriately. We're billing in compliance with the laws and the state. And as a result, we've continued to service the patients there. We do have an interim agreement with the state that expires March 1. And we've agreed with them to negotiate in good faith to extend that and hopefully, we'll get to that point. But right now, we're working through with the state but we're also trying to make sure that patients in the state aren't disadvantaged as a result of this.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Maybe just the last one, I don't know if this is for you, Bob, or for Surya. But just one of the things in healthcare reform is to remove the co-pays and deductibles around a number of rendered services and a lot of the services, I think, end up having lab test done around them. You think there's any benefit either for some volume pickup or maybe even just slightly lower bad debt on the co-pays and the deductibles as we get maybe later into the year?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, as we always thought and we believe that the outcome of the healthcare reform is going to be a net positive for us as far as tests because we're adding some tests for preventive care, we're adding some tests for some of these particular monitoring of drugs. So those from volume point of view and from new test point of view, I think it's going to be positive. Now as far as changing the health plans, we see the health plans are very anxious and they're working with us to reduce they are out of network costs.
Robert Hagemann: And Brendan with respect to bad debt, the vast majority of our bad debt is associated with patient bills. And about half of our patient bills are -- where we're billing uninsured, the other half is principally co-pays and deductibles. And there's a much higher bad debt percentage on the billing of the uninsured than there is on the co-pays and deductibles. So I would think that over time, as health care reform kicks in, and we start to get more insured lives that, that will be beneficial to the bad debt percentage.
Surya Mohapatra: [indiscernible] over 5% to total?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, between 5% and 10%. Yes.
Operator: Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: I did have a follow-up with regard to the AP business and your revenue by product disclosures sheet. The annual decrease is about 9% in 2010. Bob, I think you've characterized that throughout 2010, maybe is getting slightly better in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering if you can put a little bit more discussion around the trend and put that 9% number into context for us?
Robert Hagemann: Well, yes, Darren, as you point out, as we've been saying throughout the year, the trend has been showing some signs of improving there, particularly on the insourcing piece. And as you'd expect if we were down 9% for the year, we were down a little bit more than that in the first part of the year. We're still down at this point and as we go into the beginning of 2011, that will still be down. We won't anniversary those declines until hopefully the back-end of the year, next year.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: The expectation and I know you're not providing too much specific guidance on product line, but the expectation we should have then for AP is it is still negative for 2011?
Robert Hagemann: Well, again, I don't want to give guidance for the full year on it, but we're going to start out certainly down versus the prior year.
Surya Mohapatra: Let me make a comment about it. The reason why we provided this information is to really give you an indication about the various businesses and the strategy we have on various segments. If you look at the esoteric and gene-based testing for the whole year, it grew almost by 5%, 4.6%. And that's much faster than the Routine business because the Routine business were down 1.4%. And not only Pathology remains a very strong element of our cancer diagnostics. And if you think our cancer diagnostics and that is what we're going to provide eventually which will include Anatomic Pathology, molecular diagnostics and also hem path[ph] . Now it is down at the moment to some extent affected by the same general slowdown and some insourcing and we're working with the government as far as insourcing is concerned. But strategically, Anatomic Pathology is very important for cancer diagnostics. So all in all, we're giving you an opportunity to look at actually how we are driving strategy towards these esoteric, gene-based and AP to solve the issue of cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease. So that's the goal for that chart there.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: It's a helpful disclosure and we only get it once a year. So that's why I'm asking the question. I guess the other question I have for you is you've suggested approximately 1% organic revenue growth for 2011. And Bob, I just want to make sure I understand, are there any known contract changes with hospital or reference clients or anything that you know today that would come out of that organic number? Just want to make sure that we're not missing anything that you know at this point?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, anything that we know about contracts is baked into that number and you heard Surya say, our largest health plan contracts are all locked up for 2011. In fact, many of our largest ones are locked up beyond 2012 at this point. So we feel very good about the visibility there. Our contracts on the hospital side with GPOs and whatnot we feel good about those as well. So I think we have pretty good visibility into access and reimbursement levels as we head into 2011. And the one thing that will continue to be variable will be the business mix and how that changes an impact things. But in terms of contract access, we feel very good at this point.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: And then just on the managed care contracts, you've talked about steerage and some of the goal that you had in re-opening them. And I know I asked this before, is there anything just with your contracts, specifically, that switches in 2011 such that you have some more visibility into measurable volume or incremental volume due to steerage that you're hoping for?
Robert Hagemann: There's nothing contractual that changes with respect to that. It's really execution. We're continuing to work with multiple plans in driving these. We've had some successes and we're hopeful that we'll continue to drive volume to us as a result of continued effort between ourselves, the health plans and the employers.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG: My last question is just, what actions specifically did you take in your restructuring in Q4? And maybe can you update us on the number of lab facilities that you have? I'm not sure if there were any specific closures in your lab operations per se. And then my sort of last thing, I'll put in this question is, just on the patient service centers it sounds like you're adding more service with more phlebotomists and more PSCs perhaps. What you have done to extend the PSC footprint just to size it for us?
Robert Hagemann: First, let me start with the Q4 restructuring charge. For the most part, there were no testing facilities that were closed as part of that. That was basically for the most part a workforce reduction. It was principally folks that where we've started to look in spans and layers and these are individuals that don't necessarily touch the customer, administrative positions to a large degree are the ones that were taken out. That's why much of the charge showed up in SG&A as opposed to cost of sales. With respect to patient service centers and phlebotomists. Principally, what we're adding are phlebotomists, we're adding them in physicians offices, we're adding them in our patient service centers. In physicians offices, they're principally a tool to generate additional business and in getting to accounts where we may not have been able to get into before. In the patient services, the goal there is really to continue to improve service levels and reduce wait times. And while we've added some patient service centers in some very specific geographies that we're targeting, again that's not been the biggest driver. It's really been the additional phlebotomists.
Operator: Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Bob, could you just clarify the guidance. Does it include acquisitions or not? So I guess, it didn't include acquisitions but in your answers to another question you said that the guidance include the use of cash which might include acquisitions, just some clarification would be helpful.
Robert Hagemann: Gary, just to further clarify, the top line guidance does not include any [indiscernible] that's all organic. [indiscernible] The bottom line...
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: The EPS guidance? The EPS guidance, is that included?
Robert Hagemann: The revenue number does not. The EPS guidance assumes that our cash is deployed and we're assuming that's going to be deployed either into acquisitions or share repurchases.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then maybe Surya, could you comment on some of the [indiscernible] you did in the past couple of quarters about tracking process and, I guess, maybe some of the revisions to some [indiscernible] contracts? Are you for the most part complete with that or is that still ongoing and how might that impact results in 2011?
Surya Mohapatra: Gary, most of our contracts negotiations are complete and [indiscernible]. We have now [indiscernible] beyond 2012.
Robert Hagemann: And many of them 2013 even, with some of our largest.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So maybe fewer changes in the coming year than you've seen in the past year, is that fair way to characterize it?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. And over the next several years the percentage of revenues from health [indiscernible] coming up, I would say through 2012, into 2013, are generally less than what we would have averaged in the past.
Operator: Bob Willoughby with Bank of America.
Robert Willoughby: Bob, you've called out some of the spending on sales and services over the course of the year, can you size that for us in terms of what's not likely to recur? What was truly one-time in nature and forget about whatever revenue come in out of that but what falls out of the income statement next year for 2011?
Robert Hagemann: Bob, we have not specifically quantified that for folks. Obviously, it has put some pressure on the margins at this point. And I don't necessarily think about it as one-time. Those are going to be costs that continue. What we're expecting though is that those that costs that generate will generate some top line growth for us which in the end will help us expand margins, as opposed to putting pressure on. But we haven't quantify the specific impact of those.
Robert Willoughby: Can you maybe comment on in terms of the quarterly impact, there wasn't much in the first quarter was my understanding, but second and third pretty heavy, how was the fourth relative to the second and third quarter?
Robert Hagemann: You started to see it ramp up in the second. I would say in the third is where you've got probably the most significant impact and it continued into the fourth.
Robert Willoughby: And you've commented in healthcare reform in a number of different ways obviously, somewhat positive for you. But some of the impact in terms of the preventive screening, I guess for some plans would've felt as early as the fourth quarter. Anecdotally, I mean, your sense of contribution from any type of reform issues, either in the fourth quarter or just starting January 1, on the preventive screening what has come in?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, Bob, I would tell you that I don't think there's really been any impact at all to our business in the fourth quarter as a result of healthcare reform and what we might see in terms of additional volume there. And it's really hard to say what we might be seeing at this point in the first quarter. I think we'll have better visibility into that as we get later into the year but we're not expecting that in 2011 we're going to have significant benefit from that.
Robert Willoughby: And maybe lastly, pressure on the Medicare reimbursement rates, are you seeing any impact on the acquisition landscape? What are smaller labs doing? Are they committing? Are they retreating? The hospital labs, et cetera, what's been the competitive response?
Robert Hagemann: I don't know that the changes in Medicare reimbursement are big enough at this point for laboratory to use that as the reason to either put itself on the market or get out of the business. Certainly, as time goes on, the regulation drives costs and reimbursement comes down, that might impact smaller laboratories but I don't think what we've seen to date is having that sort of impact.
Operator: Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: The comments on physician insourcing are helpful. But there also seems to be more discussion around just the general trend of the hospitals accelerating direct employment of physicians. I guess, really, just two questions on that. One, if you can just talk about something that you're kind of worried about at the moment. And also, if you had to rank order of the two risk factors of your hospitals, directly employing physicians versus just physicians insourcing lab work. Which ones really a bigger challenge at the moment?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, the bigger challenge at the moment is the specialists insourcing their Pathology work, whether gerologist, or whether it's oncologist because that's the one which is affecting us more. As far as the hospitals buying practices, the rate of acquisitions have gone up. But still, they have to really increase capacity and I think what people have not realized that even though some of the physicians maybe a part of the hospital, that does not always lead into that those physicians have to only work with the hospitals. They still have to really do the out patients, so that's less impactful at the moment versus insourcing of Pathology by specialists.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: As far as the hospital -- was it material enough where it was a factor in your guidance for 2011? Or was it just so immaterial that it's not really a factor on the decision tree?
Surya Mohapatra: It's not a factor in 2011.
Operator: Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti: Just back to the preventive care, as this rolls out, I know you've said you're not seeing any significant impact yet. You're not expecting any material right now. But as this rolls out, additional screening and tests, should that contribute to volume this year? And are the managed care companies going to as there is additional tests, are they going to scrutinize, do you expect them to scrutinize those tests or any additional tests and try to look at the overall testing volume, in general and what tests are being administered?
Robert Hagemann: Anthony, again, I don't think that we're going to see a significant impact in utilization or volume this year as a result of healthcare reform. There might be some modest uptick as a result now of having preventive services covered. And with respect to whether or not the health plans will scrutinize that more, yes, I think it's really a function of not necessarily the utilization because I would assume that they're expecting utilization on some of those tests to go up. But are they being ordered onto the right circumstances? Most of the health plans have [ph] (1:18:04) for that, which we have seen historically to make sure that there's not overutilization of testing. But I don't think, generally, they're going to be denying or looking to reduce any additional screening testing that might be done as a result of healthcare reform.
Anthony Vendetti: And then there's been no real mention of weather. Obviously, we had pretty rough January, so far, in the East Coast. Does your volume guidance for the year take into account the potential lower volume during this month?
Robert Hagemann: Yes. As we think about volume forecast and we think about certainly the first quarter, which is the one that's generally is impacted the most by weather. What we're looking at is generally what we've seen kind of the average over the years and in any particular year where you have real severe weather that would be something that you didn't anticipate in your guidance. Yes, I would tell you at this point, look, we're not even through January yet. It's a little too early to tell what the impact in the first quarter is going to be from weather. It's certainly not helping us. It's, in fact, it's snowing outside the window right now. But look, as I think about the impact of weather on our business, it is something that happens, it's something that we have to deal with, but it doesn't impact the underlying performance or health of the business. And we just respond to it and move on.
Anthony Vendetti: Let me just clarify though, you said that the guidance assumes second half to be stronger, back-end loaded is that correct?
Robert Hagemann: Basically, what we're telling you is that the comps get less difficult in the back half of the year. So that I think as you're thinking about comparisons to the prior year, that's what we ask you to factor in.
Anthony Vendetti: The revenue growth of 1%, because, Surya, you mentioned that goal is to get back up to the 5% or 6% and you could see 2% or 3%. Once again, the revenue growth is organic. It sounds like, what you're saying is right now, as the landscape's changing, 1% is your kind of conservative kind of look. And then leaving room for upside, is that about right or...
Surya Mohapatra: I was responding to the question about the industry, and this industry, 5% to 6% organic growth, as I said, 2% to 3% volume, 2% to 3% revenue per rec. And I believe that it's going to go back to that level. But it would probably take a couple of years to go to that level just because we're just going through the economic downturn and the healthcare reform. As far as our company is concerned, we think the guidance we have input for 2011 is reasonable based on where we are coming from. But when I look at our company versus the competition in our differentiators, gene-based testing, esoteric testing, and Anatomic Pathology our focus on cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular, and our strong Healthcare IT strategy is going to make us different from our competitors and certainly, my goal and our goal is to really do better than the 1% we have. But that's the guidance we have given.
Anthony Vendetti: Do you expect to be able to take some share for many competitors either small or large?
Surya Mohapatra: I always expect to take some shares from our competitors.
Anthony Vendetti: Lastly, have you repurchased any shares so far in 2011?
Robert Hagemann: We're actually out of the market between the end of the year and when we do our earnings release.
Operator: Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Going back to just the managed care discussion, I didn't have a chance to go back and check all my notes from the 2Q. But the biggest payer, by far, on the commercial side for you guys is Aetna. Have you told us specifically when that contract expires?
Robert Hagemann: No, we have not, but that's one of our longest term contracts and goes out beyond 2013 along with several others.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: And I was listening, I was writing as quickly as I could, but Surya was talking about, I think, esoteric and gene-based testing, up 3% year-over-year including Vitamin D, up 30%. Were those revenue figures or requisition figures?
Surya Mohapatra: Those are revenue figures.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: And then my last question, just going to the comment that with revenue growth being approximately 1%, it would basically take some hard work on the expense side to get the margins to be flat. Is there going to be an opportunity, I guess, to provide more color around that or anything more detailed? I guess I'm just thinking back to a few years ago when you had targeted several hundred million dollars of savings over and there was very formal and detailed proposal for what you're going to do on the cost side. Is there an opportunity to do something like that again and to give us more visibility on what you think you can do on expenses?
Robert Hagemann: Look, we continue to drive the execution of that program. In fact, today, it's continuing to drive the efficiencies in our operations. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at some other opportunities. But I wouldn't expect there to be a big announcement from us anytime in the near term about another program. That program is continuing. We're doing some things to enhance it and keep the momentum that we've got there. And we do have good momentum there.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: Last question, can you just remind us because typically, the last five years it looks there's some pretty pronounced seasonality where operating margins moved sequentially lower from 4Q into 1Q. And that's not -- doesn't appear to always be driven by any revenue weakness. Can you kind of remind us some of the things that impact sort of first quarter margin seasonality?
Robert Hagemann: Well, certainly a lot of it does get driven by top line. There isn't a whole lot of seasonality on the cost side of the business. But a lot of it gets driven by top line, as well as in the first part of the year, what you tend to see is slightly higher bad debt as there's more deductibles, some co-pays that kick in and the bad debt starts to moderate a little bit as you get into the back half of the year. And then in the fourth quarter, your volume just do tend to be, and top line in general, tends to be softer simply because of the old holiday periods that you have in there. The week between Christmas and New Year's, for example, is an extremely slow week. So it's really just the general seasonality that you got there. The second quarter tends to be one of our strongest quarters. You don't have a whole lot of holidays in there affecting things. You don't necessarily have a lot of the summer vacations and whatnot that starts to kick in when you get into August. That's been the general trend for the business and expect it will generally continue.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup Inc: So your thought would -- I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but your thought would be operating margins probably weaker sequentially in 1Q than building over the summer and through those easier comps, I guess?
Robert Hagemann: The first and the fourth quarters tend to be the quarters with the lowest margin percentages.
Operator: Art Henderson with Jefferies & Company.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Bob, you referenced some of the success you'd have with working with managed care on the leakage issue. Is there anything you could mention there just in terms of what is working? And is it related more to the patient service centers you're doing?
Robert Hagemann: Art, it's an interesting question. I don't want to give too much in the way of details in terms of what we're doing with specific employers. But patient service centers is a piece of that, but I would say it's not the biggest piece necessarily. It's really us working collaboratively with the health plan, getting in front of the employers, being able to communicate to their employees, what the benefits are of using Quest Diagnostics versus using either out-of-network laboratory or some higher-cost in-network laboratory. And a lot of that has to do with employee communication and I would say that's probably the principal driver. In some cases though what we might be doing is to the degree that an employer has a significant concentration of employees in a particular area, we would look at our PSC footprint there and see if it makes sense to expand that in that area to help capture more. We would look at whether or not it makes sense to have a phlebotomist potentially even at the employers' site to help in that regard. But I would say that the biggest driver is really just the ability to get in front of employees and communicate the benefits of working with Quest Diagnostics.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Last question, Bob, is your sense that the training related to the sales force that, that all should relatively be completed in the first quarter. I think, as I recall, that's kind of what you thought, through the first quarter would be the time it would take to get these folks train and in second quarter the productivity factor would go higher?
Robert Hagemann: Certainly as we get through the end of the first quarter, we would expect that the sales folks that we've hired in 2010 are going to be getting up to speed. Generally, if you think about a three or six months period or so for folks to fully get up to speed, there's still some of that as we come out of the first quarter, folks that were hired in the latter part of the year. But generally, we'd expect sales force productivity would be much stronger in the first quarter than it was on the back half of this year.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And are you planning to add the same degree to the sales force this year as you did last or has it slowdown of it?
Robert Hagemann: As Surya said in his remarks, we're substantially complete with the expansion of the sales force.
Operator: Your last question is from Dawn Brock with Kaufman Bros.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Bros., L.P.: Guys, just in terms of the discussion that's pursued on the volume side, would you be willing to more specifically distinguish between all the work you've been doing with the health plans and employers? Are you seeing the recent stability in volume coming more from some market shared gains based on these new partnership initiatives? Or do you view it as an uptick in your demand based on the partnership initiative?
Robert Hagemann: It's a difficult question to answer precisely. I would say that it's a combination of all of the things that we're doing. I think it's clearly the focus that we placed on particular disease states, as Surya talked about cancer and cardiovascular and infectious disease. The fact that we've hired up sales folks to go after particular geographies or physician specialties and the efforts that we have ongoing with health plans and employers. But it's not any one thing, quite honestly. It's a combination of all of those.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Bros., L.P.: And where you're competing in more of the open-network contracts, are you feeling as though you're gaining traction?
Robert Hagemann: As I said earlier, I feel very good when we're in an open contract in terms of us getting more than our fair share of the work.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Bros., L.P.: And then my second question is, can you talk a little bit about the more recent adoption piece of the EHR system and the utilization trends that are accompanying the new adopters?
Surya Mohapatra: As I said that since we introduced we have now more than 1,800 doctors using our Care360. I think the most important thing is to really note by during the quarter we've got certified for meaningful use. That means now our physicians can earn up to $44,000 and that's really a great incentive. But apart from that, the Care360 not only provides them [indiscernible] with laboratory orders and results but physician support and also electronic prescription. So we are very pleased that how we are gaining ground in that area, we're also very pleased at how it's differentiating us from our competitors. And hopefully, we are also counting on this to have some revenue as we expand in our in-service.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Bros., L.P.: So just to follow-up on that, are you seeing greater adoption from your existing physician relationships? Or are you seeing an uptick in new relationships?
Surya Mohapatra: I think it's a mix. We're still looking at new relationships. We're also looking at the existing relationships and what's changing. We're seeing both.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Bros., L.P.: And then just as far as utilization, do you feel as though you're getting more testing, i.e, not that these physicians are necessarily ordering more testing that were already using it, but you're seeing more tests go to Quest from the existing testing base?
Surya Mohapatra: We have seen results. I don't have current results, but we have seen each time one our customer, physician customer use our Care360, we tend to get more business from that customer.

A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analyses are also available on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. We grew earnings in the third quarter despite continued softness in physician office visits. While revenue was down, we are confident in the future and are making progress executing our plans to accelerate profitable growth by promoting new gene-based and esoteric tests, enhancing sales effectiveness and improving our operational efficiency. During the quarter, earnings per share increased 11% to $1.13, revenue decreased to 1.7% to $1.9 billion and cash flow was $330 million. We are committed to using out substantial cash flow to generate value for our shareholders through both acquisitions and share repurchases. So far this year we have returned $750 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and now have flexibility to make $250 million of additional repurchases in the fourth quarter. We continue to focus on sales, service and science to drive organic growth and believe we are doing the right things to strengthen our foundation for revenue growth, increased profitability and enhanced shareholder value. We continue to promote new genetic and esoteric tests and healthcare IT services. We are upgrading our sales organization and enhancing their capabilities. We are working closely with health plans and employers to gain a larger share of their business by reducing their high-cost, out-of-network leakage. We are taking actions to make our business more efficient and we are putting our substantial cash flow to work to drive shareholder value. I will update you on our progress after Bob discusses the financial results. Bob?
Bob Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. Revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 1.7% below the prior year. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues, were also 1.7% below the prior year. Revenue per acquisition was 1.3% below the prior year and essentially unchanged from the second quarter level. While year-over-year revenue per acquisition continues to benefit from an increased mix of gene-based and esoteric testing and increases the number of tests ordered per acquisition, this benefit has been offset by some business and pair mix changes, the medicare fee decrease and pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions executed last year and earlier this year. The business and pair mix changes, which continue to pressure revenue per acquisition, include a further rebound in drugs of abuse testing and weakness in our higher priced and atomic pathology testing. We expect changes in revenue per acquisition will continue to be modest through the first half of next year with the anniversary of the business mix, pair mix and contract changes, which are currently offsetting the benefits of the growth in gene-based and esoteric testing. Volume in the third quarter was 0.3% below the prior year and continues to be pressured by the general slowdown in physician office visits. However, the third quarter volume reflects some improvement from the first and second quarters of the year, which were below the prior year by 2.6% in Q1, 1.6% although adjusted for weather and 1.3% in Q2. Drugs of abuse testing has continued to rebound and grew 7.5% in the quarter and contributed modestly in crude volume trend. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, point of care testing and healthcare IT, was about 2% below the prior year level principally due to the performance in our risk assessment business. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.1% compared to 18.4% in the prior year. We continue to make progress in managing our cost structure and driving quality improvements. We are currently evaluating a number of new opportunities to further improve our efficiency and service quality, which we believe will further streamline our cost structure. This will not only support margins during this period of market softness but also will allow us to disproportionately take advantage of the market rebound. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4% in the quarter compared to 4.4% a year ago. BSOs at 43 days are unchanged from the beginning of the year. Earnings per share were $1.13 in the quarter, an 11% increase from the prior year. EPS benefitted by $0.08 in the quarter as a result of a reduced tax rate which was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. Cash from operations was $330 million and compares to $374 million in last year's third quarter, the difference primarily due to the commune of interest in tax payments. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $41 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased 7 million shares at an average price of $46.64 for a total of $324 million. We have now fully utilized the $750 million share repurchase authorization granted in January of this year. Earlier today we announced that our board has authorized an additional $250 million of share repurchases to provide us with continued flexibility to deploy our cash through the fourth quarter. This incremental repurchase authorization is intended to bridge us until we complete our planning for 2011 and should not necessarily be viewed as the plan repurchase level for Q4. The level of share repurchases in any given quarter will continue to be a function of a number of factors, most notably expected acquisition activity. We plan to evaluate what level of authorization will be appropriate beyond the end of this year as part of our annual operating and capital plans and expect to share that with you in January as we have done historically. Our cash balance coupled with our unused credit lines provides us with significant liquidity and has positioned us extremely well to capitalize on growth opportunities and take other actions like share repurchases to drive shareholder value. Turning to full-year guidance, we now expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows. Revenue, to be approximately 1.5% below the prior year; operating income to be between 17.5% and 18% of revenues; cash from operations to approximately $1.1 billion; capital expenditures to approximately $200 million; and, lastly, diluted earnings per share to be between $3.95 and $4. As you will hear more about this area, we continue to focus our efforts on accelerating growth, including exploring both strategic and opportunistic acquisitions. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to drive efficiency in our operations, which together with improved top line performance we expect will accelerate earnings growth. Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Bob. Our updated guidance reflects the fact that while we are seeing progress some of the actions we have been taking to accelerate growth are taking longer to produce results than we had expected. None of us are satisfied, however, we are seeing encouraging signs and I want to provide you with an update on the progress we are making on some of the initiatives we shared with you earlier this year. We are investing in our sales organization. We are hiring and providing ongoing training to people who, over time, will serve as trusted consultants to doctors and other customers to meet their diagnostic testing needs. Over the past several quarters we have continued to add new talent to our sales force overall and in key specialty areas and geographies. So far this year we have upgraded the overall sales force and added about 100 new positions. To make them effective sooner we have enhanced our training programs in various subspecialty areas including oncology and genetic testing and we are giving them advanced tools to better target sales leads. As we shared with you last quarter, we have been working with health plans and have extended some of our health plan contracts to give us visibility and pricing stability. This has enabled us to turn our focus to working closely with health plans and their employer clients to reduce high costs and out-of-network lab spending, known as leakage. Health plans and large employers are considering changes in plan design that both drive business to us as a preferred provider and reduce lab costs for the health plans, employers and their employees. I am pleased that some health plans have also made reimbursement policy changes to address overutilization caused by in-sourcing of certain kinds of anatomic pathology. We continue to promote new esoteric and gene-based tests that help physicians personalize care. During the quarter, esoteric and gene-based testing grew about 4% driven largely by sales to hospitals and physician specialists. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from Vitamin D testing which uses the tandem mass spectrometry platform, the gold standard in our industry. We have also driven double-digit revenue growth in ImmunoCAP allergy testing as well as testing for blood cancers, particularly our Leumeta family of blood tests and we are pleased by the increase we are seeing in the adoption of our OVA1 test for ovarian cancer. Service delivery is an important competitive differentiator and we have announced our service levels in several ways. We have added personnel such as phlebotomists and service reps and are opening new person service centers to offer convenience to patients and we are significantly reducing the time ti takes to connect new clients to our Care360 connectivity solutions. Healthcare IT is a strategic differentiator for us and care360 is the center piece. Care360 is not just a customer service. It's how we run our business. We depend on it every day so it has met the test of time. This month we passed a major milestone of 40 billion test results processed and transmitted via Care360 since it was launched six years ago. We are pleased that the American Medical Association selected our Care360 EHR as one of the few EHR solutions that can be accessed from their portal. We have partnered with Hewlett Packard to provide and integrated system to physician practices to accelerate their adoption of Care360 HER. Since we introduced the Care360 Electronic Health Record earlier this year more than 1000 doctors are using it. We generate strong cash flow. We are committed to deploying our cash to drive growth. Our preference is to invest in acquisitions primarily in genetics, esoteric testing and cancer diagnostics, including anatomic pathology. We are active in evaluating potential acquisitions that make economic and strategic sense. When acquisitions are not available on reasonable terms, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In closing, we are making tangible progress o a number of important initiatives. The long-term trends for our business continue to be positive and, as the industry leader, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends. Thank you. We will now take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital:  I wanted to ask you if you could comment on the pricing growth in the quarter. I know you mentioned there were some contrasting things in the second quarter. The lower growth this quarter is it due to kind of a full quarter of that, the contracts in September quarter or is there something else that is going on there?
Bob Hagemann: The contract changes were fully reflected in the second quarter and, yes, just continuing this quarter. Essentially, what you see is revenue per acquisition in Q3 essentially flat with where it was in Q2 and really what's driving the change in the year-over-year comparison is really the comps at this point. But we've got stability in revenue per acquisition and we're not expecting the absolute level of revenue per acquisition to change significantly from where it's at in the fourth quarter.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital:  Where it's at in Q3? So you do expect the sequential flat number there in Q4.
Bob Hagemann: Correct. We're not expecting it to change significantly.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital:  Then a question on the physician in-sourcing; have you seen the dynamic there kind of pick up? I guess, is the upgrade in the sales force somewhat a response to some of those issues that are going on?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, when we saw this year -- when we observed slowness in the marketplace and the less number of physician office visits, we said that we are going to enhance our sales people, hire some people where we didn't have [upgrade] people, train them in genetic and esoteric testing and cancer diagnostics and we're going to improve our service. Although the office visits are down by 4% but our revenue decline is 1.7% so we feel that we are seeing the revenue decline is moderating and now that we have surprising stability the sales force effectiveness is improving.
Bob Hagemann: While we continue to see in-sourcing of both the technical and professional component, there are some signs that the rate of that is beginning to slow.
Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital: Is there a general sense that there are some legal issues with doing that? Is that potentially causing that rate to slow?
Bob Hagemann: Well, I'm not sure exactly what's causing it at this point. But, yes, as we've indicated previously we do believe that this in-sourcing is essentially a form of self referral which it creates unnecessary utilization and we're working through that with our lobbying through [Acola] and others to try and alert legislators and policy makers to that effect.
Surya Mohapatra: Some health plans have already taken into that consideration and they're restricting reimbursement in in-sourcing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: So just want to go back to the sort of guidance. It looks like revenue and EBIT guidance seems to imply that 4Q is going to see a little bit of a drop off or worsen a little bit. Anything particular there going on that we should be aware of?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, Ralph, the one thing that I would point out is -- I mean, you're right. Q4 implied guidance does indicate that we'll see a little further softening in revenue growth in Q4. One of the things that's important to keep in mind is that last year's fourth quarter benefitted from the flu season, the H1N1 scare. We are not expecting this year's flu season to be anything like that. In fact, we're expecting it to be a more normal flu season. But that's something that we've anticipated all along in our guidance. That's not what's driving the change in guidance. It's really what's driving how Q4 looks relative to the other quarters.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Then maybe, Bob, if you could talk about the sustainability of the bad debt improvement kind of going forward. Obviously it's helped the last couple, few quarters and it continues to trend down, just your thoughts there.
Bob Hagemann: Well, it's an area that we continue to pay a lot of attention to and despite some of the challenges with the economy this year and the like, we've been able to continue to drive down bad debt. It's an area that we deploy a lot of sic sigma resources against. Our focus is really on continuous improvement there. While I think there are continued opportunities to further drive down bad debt, they're not as significant, obviously, as when our bad debt was in the high single digits. But, yes, I do think there continue to be opportunities. They'll be a function of decreased use of electronic ordering. Ultimately, as well, when we see more insured patients as a result of healthcare reform I think that's going to also serve to help reduce bad debt.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: My last one going back to pricing, going forward, just to be clear, do you think this is sort of a level of kind of a base line that we should think about going forward?
Bob Hagemann: Well, certainly, for the rest of this year we're not expecting significant changes in revenue per acquisition in absolute terms. Next year, as you know, we'll likely have a medicare fee decrease, which will put some downward pressure but we continue to expect that growth in g-based and esoteric testing and test mix is going to have a positive impact on revenue per acquisition. But as we said the last quarter and even prior to that, the big driver of our historic increases in revenue per acquisition has been test mix, business mix, number of tests ordered per acquisition. We expect that that will continue to have a positive influence. What we'll see, I think, going forward is as things like the importer solutions where the drugs of abuse testing business grows, that puts some downward pressure on it but that's, frankly, not a bad thing to have that business growing. It's just changing the mix a little bit.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: My last one, are you done -- is it fair to say you're done proactively approaching managed care to extend out the contracts or is this something we should think about as ongoing?
Surya Mohapatra: First of all, we work very closely with the health plans and all our large contracts are done and we have contracts beyond 2012 and now we actually turn our focus to work with them very closely to reduce their leakage.
Bob Hagemann: What we have coming up over the course of the next several years is, in terms of renewals, is significantly less than we would have had in a typical year on average.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrick - Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to just ask the question, Surya, you mentioned in your prepared remarks some of the work you're doing with managed care to prevent leakage. I guess, a few questions here; number one, have you incorporated any of those plan design changes into your contracts at this point or is this right now an ongoing conversation about how it would be structured?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, Darren, the most important thing, I feel very, very encouraged with the work that's going on with the health plan organization and [our] organization. When you look at how much leakage the health plans have and how much extra money employees are paying now we are working now with the health plans and their employer clients and providing information to our sales people and to the health plan themselves to really reduce leakage. So I feel pretty good about the work that's going on there.
Bob Hagemann: Darren, typically what you see in terms of contract language is that we'll work together and sometimes we outline how we might work together and the like but plan design changes are something that we can't contractually obligate the plan to do because that involves the employer as well. Yes, as you heard earlier, we are working jointly with health plans and employers to t4ry and get them to understand why those plan design changes are necessary and in some cases have been very successful in that regard. We're encouraged by what we see and think that we'll see more of it.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Just so I'm clear because my understanding is that this grandfathering issue may cause a lot of large employers to really prevent them from making substantive plan design changes. I’m just wondering if you're seeing that that's the case and, if so, can you just expand a little bit more on how you're working differently today with the contract structures that you have?
Bob Hagemann: Well, the grandfathering question is a good question. I think, yes, based upon the data I've seen it's probably split 50, 50 as to whether or not companies are actually trying to keep their plans grandfathered. I mean, there's pluses and minuses, as you know, to that. But what we've seen and what we've been doing with the plans is in addition to plan design changes, making it more attractive for them to stay in network and the like we've been working with the health plans to educate the employers and their employees about the benefits of staying in network, even if there's not necessarily a plan design change, educating them about the benefits of lower cost, educating them about the convenience that we offer with our patient service centers and the like and it's resonated. We expect that we'll continue to do that.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Then if I could just switch gears a little bit, Bob, to the buyback. I think you've clearly stated a buyback would be the bigger focus when deals aren't readily available. I guess the question I have is are you sending a message here that you just aren't seeing any good deals over the near term? If that's the message, why do you think that is?
Surya Mohapatra: First of all, we're not giving any message actually. In fact, the message we're giving that our preference will be to have acquisitions which will make, as I said, economic and strategic sense. But we're not going to really buy things for buying sake and that when those things are not available in reasonable terms we are saying that we're going to return money to shareholders.
Bob Hagemann: Darren, what you see is us just following through on what we've told you in the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dawn Brock - Kaufman Brothers.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Brothers: Just maybe to follow up on the last question specifically for the fourth quarter, with an additional $250 million now authorized for specifically the fourth quarter is that -- I guess the question is, should we assume that maybe M&A activity would not pick up in the next two months and we could look for you to give us that additional guidance come January? Can we kind of confirm that?
Bob Hagemann: Dawn, let me clarify. First of all, the additional share repurchase authorization is not limited to the fourth quarter. I want to clarify that. It's open-ended in terms of timeframe. The reason that it's a relatively small authorization compared to what you've historically seen is we're thinking of this as a bridge to what we might do in the first quarter because right now we're in our whole capital planning process. We'll think about the level of share repurchase authorization that we want for 2011 beyond and we'll inform you as to what we're doing there in January as we typically do when we provide full-year guidance. But we are not trying to send a signal that there is no deal activity that will in fact -- I think I did mention in the prepared remarks that the big variable in any quarter is the deal activity. So don’t necessarily assume that we're going to complete that $250 million in the fourth quarter. We've just now got that flexibility to do it.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Brothers: I think really where I wanted to get a little bit more color is, Surya, in your prepared remarks you talked about new tests. We would love to hear, I think, about what you're working on there. Secondly, EHR connectivity solutions obviously Care360 is out there. It's got at least the initial final rule stage one certification. I know that you're going for the final certification now that the rules are out. Can you just give us an update on the enrollment and just the marketing around that and where you think that goes from here?
Surya Mohapatra: Let me first talk about the tests. As you know, we are focused on three diseases. There's cancer, infections disease and cardiovascular disease. The current tests, which are really growing double-digit tests as I said about Vitamin D and ImmunoCAP for allergy testing, Leumeta for lymphoma and leukemia. But the tests which are in the pipeline and we are very excited about -- we just introduced OVA1 for ovarian cancer. We will promote Septin 9 ColoVantage for colorectal cancer, AccuType CP which is for the Plavix therapy and some of the personalized what you call the companion diagnostics like [EZ for pathways]. So there's a number of tests that's in the pipeline and I feel good about where our science and innovation is bringing new products. So that's about the tests. With regards to EHR and Care360, as I said, I was very excited that Care360 just passed 40 billion tests, so this is not like buying an EHR system from an IT company who is not really using it every day. So the advantage of our Care360 EHR is that it is a system which is fully tested. Since we introduced it almost 1000 doctors are using it and, as you know, we have partnered with Hewlett Packard to provide an integrated system with hardware and software and now it is being promoted by AMA, so we are very, very encouraged about the future of our EHR.
Kathleen Valentine: Dawn, this is Kathleen. You did mention we did get preliminary [feature] certification. We are expecting final [feature] certification by the end of the year. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we're pleased to see that we've got over 1000 active physicians using EHR and we just launched it at the end of Q1 this year. So we're pleased with the uptick in what we're seeing in the EHR adoption.
Dawn Brock - Kaufman Brothers: Kathleen, actually anybody, could you just give us an idea for the physicians that are enrolling and adopting EHR who had been on Care360 in the past, can you give us some sort of indication as to whether or not you actually see increased utilization of testing for those physicians, for those practices?
Kathleen Valentine: We do look at that, Dawn, in terms of across all of the Care360 solutions from lab orders and results on through EHR and we do see an uptick in the business we get from those existing physician customers when we either install or upgrade their solution within the Care360 product offering. So it truly is a stickiness benefit for us and that's one of the reasons the physicians choose it. But it makes running their practice much easier.
Bob Hagemann: Dawn, to reinforce what Kathleen just said, it's not necessarily increased utilization on the part of the physican but we're getting more of that physician's work because it's easier to deal with us, we're more embedded into the workflow, et cetera.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets: Just a couple of questions; going back to comments on the M&A environment, Surya, I was wondering if you could tell us how you view the current environment and potential opportunities.
Surya Mohapatra: We have a very active program on M&A and we constantly evaluate what is available. But we are primarily focused on the M&A which is going to help us, our genetic esoteric and with all the (inaudible) laboratories or the hospitals. So I think it boils down to what makes economic sense and what makes strategic sense and we are very encouraged at what is available now in cancer diagnostics and in the genetic field.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets: Then just going back to the managed care pricing, there was, in my opinion, a little confusion last quarter and now that we've had more time to think about this, in my view, I think things are stable now and maybe you could -- I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color about what you were really talking about last quarter in the managed care pricing. Bob, you made the initial comments about several large contract extensions. I think this quarter you mentioned that they happened last year and also earlier this year. Could you quantify that context? Are we talking about -- has there really been any changes or switching of contracts?
Bob Hagemann: I wouldn't say necessarily switching, Kevin. Yes, as we indicated last quarter and I reinforced this quarter, this has been something that we've been doing for probably the last 18 months or so. It's really designed for us to be able to change the dialogue with the health plans. Make sure, one, that we have visibility into reimbursement; make sure that we have access to the health plan members but now change the dialogue from one of regularly discussing contract terms and the like to one where we're working together to figure out how to capture that leakage. As Surya has said, yes, I think we're starting to see the benefits of that now. Our discussions with the health plans are much more focused now on what we can do to drive this work in network, which is beneficial, obviously, to us but also to the health plan, the employers and the members. So, to me, that's the other real benefit associated with this.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  What types of things can you do to capture the leakage and drive more in network utilization?
Surya Mohaptra: I think, first of all, the most important thing we can do is what I call the analytics and informatics. If we know how much the health plan is paying for an account -- there's all four expenses when people go out of network. So now they know what is going on and we can do the analytics because we are a very strong informatics group and we are looking at data with them and now we can go back and say, "Dr. X's facility is spending so much money," and it's actually one X if it comes to Quest and it's four X if it's going outside. So that realization of that opportunity is now driving the work both by the managed care organization and by us providers and also the employers. So that is the new thing which we are now getting because of our extended relationship and because of how we are providing them with the data.
Bob Hagemann: Right and interesting enough, Kevin, sometimes in that regard you would think that the health plans have state of the art analytic capabilities. In some cases they don't have what you'd expect and we can provide some better insights than they can as to where the testing volume is going and the like and what type of testing, et cetera, based upon what type of physician, all those things. The other thing I would tell you is, without getting into too much detail here, we can work with the employer and the health plan to make using Quest Diagnostics even more convenient. That's some of what we're doing as well which is driving business to us.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets: I know it's kind of early since Empire Blue Cross opened up on August 1 but have you noticed any changes in volumes coming from that plan that you could talk about?
Bob Hagemann: We have, Kevin. As you'd expect, any time you add providers to a contract you'd expect that they would pick up some business and that certainly has happened. Yes, I would characterize it as not material to our overall results and in line with our expectations and fully built into the guidance that we provided.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets: Last question, on the drugs of abuse, that grew, I think, 7.5% this quarter. Is that absolute growth or is that just due to an easy comp do you think?
Bob Hagemann: Well, it is absolute growth. I would imagine that the comps will continue to get easier. But it truly is absolute growth year-over-year.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray.
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the, I guess, technically the pending change coming out of Palmetto as it relates to code stacking and genetics and arrays coming up here later towards the end of the year. I just want to ask how does this, if at all, affect logistics for some of your esoteric tests? How do you think about this in conjunction with some of the pipeline tests, et cetera?
Kathleen Valentine: Bill, are you referring to what AMA is looking at and making changes to reimbursement for molecular tests?
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: There certainly is that as well but I guess I'm specifically referring to Palmetto, a notification that went out in I believe it was late August talking about additional paperwork and clinical data, et cetera, in order to get reimbursed for some of these tests.
Kathleen Valentine: Yes, I mean, we'll certainly comply with what Palmetto has put out there in terms of submitting our claims in a way that we'll get paid. I think Palmetto is maybe kind of getting out ahead and leading the pack in terms of what AMA is now looking at. From that perspective we certainly support the goal of -- is looking at reimbursement that's based on an ANA like specific reimbursement, which is consistent with other sections of the CPT manual and anything that gives more clarity in terms of what the payer's specifically paying for we think is a good thing but we want to make sure that we get appropriately paid for any test that we perform.
Bob Hagemann: One of the things I'd reinforce as well is any of the panels that we've got out there we believe are driven by what's medically necessary and clinically relevant. So in terms of code stacking and piling things on I feel as though we're in a very good position and supported by medical necessity.
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Certainly taking a look at the overall business I'd argue that you guys are very well positioned compared to a lot of labs out there. I guess if I could push on this a little bit how do we think about this relative to saying over one or Septin 9 where there's limited clinical evidence out there, Bob, do you see that being a barrier at all or do you think that from a back office and payer standpoint you're in pretty good shape?
Bob Hagemann: On an individual test like that I think it continues to be education, education of the physicians, education of the health plans, the utility that these tests have and that's what going to drive the utilization of them. I don't necessarily think that what Palmetto is doing is going to dramatically affect the uptick of those type tests.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: I just had a couple of follow-up questions. I guess first, Bob, on the revenue growth guidance that's a little bit lower than what you had expected before, I'm assuming that's because you were saying that some of the actions you've taken are taking a little longer to gain traction. Is that sort of the key behind the change?
Bob Hagemann: Absolutely, Tom. That's what Surya referred to in his comments. But, yes, I would tell you that we're increasingly confident that these are the right things to do. We're seeing some signs of progress and we're encouraged by that. But we would obviously like it to be benefitting us quicker. As I said, we're seeing some positive signs at this point and believe we're on the right track.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Just maybe to get an understanding of what's going on there, I think you mentioned maybe hiring 100 sales positions or something. Is the timing of let's say hiring people like that or is the ramp that you're seeing? Can you give us maybe a little more color on what's been different so that we can have the confidence that it is sort of headed in the right direction?
Surya Mohapatra: Sure, Tom. As we move our company to more and more esoteric and gene-based testing -- at the moment we are -- 35% to 36% of our revenue is gene-based and esoteric testing. We are moving more and more towards disease-based solutions like cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease. So the first thing we have to do is upgrade our sales force. So we have been doing this over the last 12 months and then as we saw the market softening and this less number of physician office visits we decided to put new people in new areas, especially in cancer diagnostics and allergy pathology and gene-based testing. We have added 100 new people and they will be selling in areas where we never sold before. So although it is taking some time -- but I have seen the sales people and I feel pretty confident that what we are doing is building up a very good sales organization which is focused on customer segment and subspecialty segments which is going to pay off in the long term.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Then maybe one or two other things here; on the pathology side I think you said that you sort of maybe saw some signs that the in-sourcing was slowing a bit. So directionally is your volume deterioration, is it getting better? Is that the implication there?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, (inaudible), anatomic pathology is going through a tremendous challenge. However, what we are seeing is some leveling off in the in-sourcing. I think people are realizing that when you have in-sourcing you have overutilization and we are working with our (inaudible) system and CAP to really provide the data and also some health plans have now figured out actually that they are paying more. Now, having said that, it is a business challenge but the future is very bright because we have got (inaudible) in allergy pathology and cancer diagnostics and we're going to build on that.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: On bad debt it's obviously getting better in a difficult environment. What are some of the particular areas that you're seeing that improvement, Bob? Is it certain pieces of the business? Is it maybe progress from some prior acquisitions? Or is there anything specific that you can point to there?
Bob Hagemann: Well, Tom, we are certainly continuing to make progress with the AmeriPath bad debt, so when you think about prior acquisitions and drivers of -- that's certainly part of it. It's not all of it though. This is -- it's an area where it's a business of details. As I told you, we're a sic sigma organization. We apply those principals to everything that we do and there's hundreds of millions of transactions that go through billing every day. To the degree that we can touch them just a few less times we can save ourselves not only bad debt but we can also reduce the cost of the billing operation. That's the way we're going to continue to approach it. It's going to be incremental for the most part but I would say that there's no one big area. One area that we are getting some benefit from though is a little bit of mix patient billing, which is one of the biggest sources of bad debt, is down year-over-year and that's contributed a little bit to the improvement that we've seen as well.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Last one, just curious, you mentioned cancer testing a few different times. Any thoughts on the Epigenomics colorectal blood cancer test that starting development out there?
Surya Mohapatra: Septin 9 ColoVantage, we are pretty excited about it and we are doing a soft launch and it's going to be promo-ed very soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: I want to discuss the contract extensions and the in-sourcing. I guess, can you maybe talk in a little more detail what is it about the contract extensions that allows the managed share companies and yourselves to focus more on reducing some of the leakage.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, it's not only the contract extensions. I think if you just think about how much time we spend trying to see every two or three years [renewing] the contract and this uncertainty about what is exclusive and non-exclusive and the fact that we have now worked with them -- and remember we're working with them and they [opinion is that] if we have a longer period we can invest together in certain activities like analytics, like informatics, like working with them. That has really changed the focus just like negotiating to reduce unit cost. Now we are talking about to really reduce leakage. So it's a culture change when you have a longer period. That's the most important thing I find and I see. I am very encouraged.
Bob Hagemann: To Surya's point, he characterized it as an investment which it absolutely is, Gary. As you think about this the health plans are introducing us more and more to the employers and if they're going to introduce us to employers, have us much more ingrained in that employer, they want to know that there's a long-term relationship there. These longer contracts are an enabler to that.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: I guess the question that I have and that it raises is that under the prior contracts that they would not have been incented enough to want to reduce the leakage. That, I guess, is the piece that I want to come back to.
Surya Mohapatra: No, I think that's not the case, actually. We've been working with them also. I think what you are saying is maybe everything is coming together in the healthcare reform, uncertainty is actually what is happening in the health care costs, so all these things have come together. I think looking back some of the things we have done along with the investment we are making in the company is we're in a better place to work with the health plans and the employers, so it's not a question that they were not working and these contracts are going to give us opportunities, just give us a longer period to invest and work rather than every two years we spend time negotiating and reducing unit cost.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: Just in the third quarter, did you extend additional contracts or are you just sort of continuing to see the impact from the changes that had been made prior to the third quarter?
Bob Hagemann: There was nothing significant in the third quarter. Basically, what you're seeing is just a carry over of what we've done last year and earlier this year.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: Then just sort of final follow-up; you gave some good commentary about pricing overall. On the rest of the book of business just in terms of thinking about the commercial book of business will on an apples-to-apples basis pricing be up similarly on the commercial book of business or will it be up to a lesser extent from what it has in the past?
Bob Hagemann: We're expecting revenue per acquisition to be relatively unchanged over the course of the remainder of the year.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: Just on the commercial book of business or on the entire book of business?
Bob Hagemann: On the entire book of business.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: How about going into 2011?
Bob Hagemann: Well, we'll give you more insight into 2011 in January.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: I have a couple of questions. The first one, Bob, just to clarify, guidance does not include the additional buyback of $250 million in the fourth quarter, correct?
Bob Hagemann: What guidance always includes is us deploying our cash, whether it be into acquisitions or share repurchases. We typically, Ricky, don't give specific guidance as to how much we'll be doing in terms of share repurchases. But generally the guidance assumes that we're putting the cash flow to work.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Then the second clarification is on the top line growth metric for the fourth quarter. The guidance implies negative 2.7% of growth year-over-year. I understand the sales force initiative that's taking time to materialize. But is there something that you're seeing in the fourth quarter to date that makes you think that sequentially, both year-over-year but also sequentially -- again, year-over-year I understand the flu differential -- sequentially things are going to deteriorate beyond the normal seasonality? It just seems that you're factoring in greater decline than we've seen in the past between third quarter to fourth quarter and if you can just give us some more color on that. Is it the Empire (inaudible) that you're factoring in would be very helpful?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, Ricky, there's nothing specific relative to Empire that we're factoring in that would cause Q4 growth to look different than Q3 growth. The principal driver of the differences I said earlier is our view of the flu season, the fact that we're not going to have the H1N1 scare that we had last year. But, yes, I think in terms of sequential progress, we feel good about the progress that we're making there. It doesn't have -- you don't see the results necessarily within one quarter. It takes time for these to show up in the results but we do feel as though we're continuing to make progress there.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: But, again, to the point -- I guess I’m trying to understand whether kind of the change in the fourth quarter guidance is just you being conservative or do you think, again, ex-flu season because that was factored into your original guidance. You just think that the overall environment is going to potentially somewhat slow down versus third quarter. 
Bob Hagemann: I wouldn't say that we're expecting the overall environment to slow down. We're expecting physician office visits to be comparable and not change significantly. The one thing that I would say is we do expect a little bit of softness in our non-clinical testing business in the fourth quarter. The risk assessment business continues to be soft. The clinical trials business, we probably have good visibility , at least a quarter out into that business. We expect that to be a little softer in Q4 as well.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Then lastly, Surya, on the acquisition strategy, can you prioritize for us just in terms of kind of how you think about acquisitions both based on what's out there as kind of number one four (inaudible) acquisitions [for] the international and then acquisitions outside kind of the core testing business? If you can walk us through that it would be great.
Surya Mohapatra: Sure. I think you started with, number one, with the easy one, with the four (inaudible), the regional labs and some hospital laboratories. So those things are what I call that we do it in due course of business, so there's number one. Number two is anything that is going to help us in cardiovascular disease, cancer diagnostics and infections disease, so that one's genetic and esoteric testing and cancer diagnostics including allergy pathology because those three diseases we are focused. As you know, I have always said that our future is in science and innovation, so the second tier, which is the most of our [war] going on, is do we have acquisitions available to help us in cancer diagnostics in genetic and esoteric? Then the third one, once those are done, then we look at actually the point of care (inaudible) testing. We have invested in India and it's a long-term investment and we are not looking at any major international acquisitions in the short term. So those are the strategies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette - UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS: A couple of questions here, first, you have 100 new sales reps that you're adding. Based on my math I would add maybe about $20 million in annualized costs. I'm just curious, did that start in the fourth quarter or was some of that run rate already absorbed in 3Q, just trying to get a sense of that for modeling purposes?
Bob Hagemann: Steven, some of that -- obviously a big piece of that is already absorbed and reflected in Q3. The interesting thing is while you get the cost up front you don't get the full benefit of the sales force until they're trained, they're up and running and they're out in the field. We're starting to see the productivity starting to ramp up at this point. So we're expecting going forward we're going to see a nice return on that investment.
Steven Valiquette - UBS: Then on the anatomical pathology, or AP, I know you don't break down these number quarterly. You only give them annually. But I’m just trying to get a sense for the range of where that trend is right now. I know your AP revs were down 0.5% for the fully year in '09. Maybe they were a little worse at the end of the year. So for the first half of '10 I'm sure it was worse than that trend line as well. But should we think of this as right now AP volumes may be down 5% to 10%, I mean, range ballpark and then pricing flattish? I mean, is that the way to kind of think of it right now?
Bob Hagemann: Steven, as Surya indicated earlier, that business is under significant pressure. We aren't breaking it out at this point and we'll consider providing some more information at the end of the year.
Steven Valiquette - UBS: Last just quick question on that, as far as the physician in-sourcing overall, was there any evidence either earlier this year or even now that this was ever expanding beyond AP or was that really the main area we're seeing it? There were some other companies that were kind of alluding to. They were seeing the same issue outside of AP like in oncology and some other areas. I'm just curious how you see that from categorization.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, I think the main in-sourcing we have see, actually, [other than] oncology is allergy pathology actually and GI and GU. Did you mean that were they going to do any clinical testing? Physicians still have their fees in office labs. So it refers to only AP.
Steven Valiquette - UBS: So you're not seeing it move down the acuity scale, basically what it sounds like.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy - William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Just a few questions, actually, one, the first one is a clarity on previous questions. In terms of the revenue guidance change, so am I understanding it correctly that that is primarily due to changes in the non-clinical testing business? Is that fair?
Bob Hagemann: No, Amanda, that's a component of it but the principal reason for the change in the revenue guidance is that some of these things that we're working on that we put in place are just delivering results a little further out than we had anticipated.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: So that's more on the volume side of the world then, right, than pricing it sounds like.
Bob Hagemann: Correct. Right, so you should think about the adjustment in guidance as being principally due to volume.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Then it sounds like given the (inaudible) shift your focus on then that it's maybe on the esoteric side of the world versus the clinical routine. Is that fair?
Bob Hagemann:  No. I think the esoteric business we feel good about that it's continuing to grow. As we indicated, it grew 4% in the quarter. But just the overall business I wouldn't differentiate between the routine and the esoteric at this point in terms of what caused us to adjust the guidance.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Then just on the revenue per acquisition commentary, I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly but so if it's flat on a dollar basis and the managed care pricing environment is relatively stable then it sounds like you got a benefit from mix. I would have thought that it would have been sequentially up. Is that -- am I thinking about that wrong or not?
Bob Hagemann: Sequential -- well, the mix, we've seen that switch throughout the year. We haven't necessarily gotten a benefit in mix in this quarter. In fact, as the drugs of abuse testing business grows that puts pressure on the mix because that's lower price business.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Then just last one, I don't know if you're willing to make any comments here but one of your competitors made a pretty sizeable announcement related to a transaction. Do you have any comments there? Then just also another question on M&A in terms of focus; is it fair to say that you're maybe more focused on the services side versus product?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, we're not going to make any announcement about what we're looking at. But all I can tell you is that we're very active in looking at assets which is going to help our company. As I told you, we're going to focus on cancer, cardiovascular studies and infectious disease. We have our strategies and services and laboratory and licensing and getting tests but if we get appropriate assets on point of care (inaudible) that's also not off the radar.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: Just on the genomic and esoteric testing I know that was 35%, 36% of revenues. It's been, I think, pretty much that number for most of this year. How much do you think that that's going to increase as we move through 2011 as a percent of revenues? Is that 40% kind of goal? Is that a one to two-year goal or is that more like a three to five-year goal? Then if you could just talk about an update on the international revenues and how the expansion is going internationally.
Bob Hagemann: Anthony, yes, here's the way that we should think about the percentage of gene-based, esoteric and [endotopic] pathology of the total business. If generally a test starts out as esoteric, if we're lucky it actually becomes routine over time and the vo0lumes ramp up significantly because it's becoming much more widely utilized. So you think about the life cycle of a test, it starts out as esoteric, over time moves to routine. So that sort of puts a natural governor on how big a percentage esoteric business can become of your total book of business. But, yes, I would expect though that it would continue to grow over time but we don't have a specific target there.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: Then internationally could you just give us an update on how that's going?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, internationally we have the clinical trials business and the product business. (Inaudible) doing well and they're on their plan but when you think about the laboratory services our major investment in India and we're now focused on a growth plan. It is a long-term investment but I think although it would take some time but that's the right thing to do because there's a lot of opportunity in India with the 300 million middle class. But it is very small and very (inaudible).
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: Then lastly just on physician volume, I mean, the physician office visits obviously have been weak the last couple quarters. Are you seeing that stabilizing or do you expect that to be weak through the remainder of this year ad into 2011 until the economy recovers or employment picks up?
Bob Hagemann: Anthony, yes, as we indicated earlier, the physician office visits, at least for the first two months of the third quarter, were pretty much in line with what we saw in the second quarter and that's down between 4% and 5%. We're not expecting that to change dramatically over the course of this year. As we think about 2011, again, we'll give you some better insights into 2011 in January. But at this point our guidance for the rest of this year does not anticipate any significant swing one way or the other in how physician office visits behave.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners: How much leakage is out there? I'm sure it would vary by plan but we've been hearing about reducing leakage for a long time and yet there's not a lot of data out there to work with.
Bob Hagemann: Kemp, that's an interesting question and it's a significant number. I would tell you in some cases when you look at what's either off contract or going to the higher cost providers on contract it could be multiples of what the large commercial labs are actually realizing at this point. So it's a big opportunity. Obviously a lot of it's in with the hospitals and it doesn't necessarily all need to be moving off contract spend. In a lot of cases you can shift contracted spend to lower cost providers and that's part of what we're looking to do as well.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners: But in terms of just say a percentage of spend or the like there's no number ballpark to think about.
Bob Hagemann: Well, when you just think about the total market, hospitals account for 60% of the total market and add on top of that the fact that there are other providers that are not contracted, so it gives you some sense as to the total size of the opportunity.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners: Secondly, with regard to anatomic pathology and the plans, can you give us some color with regard to whether any of these plans are the national plans and if these payment restrictions how hard they are, is it a preauthorization or is it an absolute ban on payments to these arrangements?
Bob Hagemann: It depends because each plan is approaching it differently. It varies by national plan as well as some of the regional plans. But in some cases they're outright denying reimbursement and they're indicating two physicians they will not reimburse for certain testing performed in the office.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners: The last question relates to the sales force renewal. I think earlier on this year at least offline discussions were we are adding to the sales force but don't necessarily assume that say 100 is a net number. Is 100 a net addition number now?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, 100 is a number -- new positions and new territories.
Kemp Dolliver - Avondale Partners: But the size of your total sales force is increasing about 10% or is it -- ?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor - Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: A couple questions, I just wanted to make sure on the earnings guidance of the year, the $3.95 to $4, that's using the $3.09 year-to-date. Is that correct?
Bob Hagemann: Correct. It has the year-to-date number in it.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Can you help us think about gross margin a little bit? I guess historically gross margin's typically higher in the third and a little lower in the fourth. This time around it was lower in the third and I think the guidance, which has probably the gross margin [was] lower in the fourth quarter as well. I know pricing was stable sequentially. So can you talk about that 90-basis point drop in gross margin sequentially?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, Gary, as we said in the past we look principally at the operating income number as opposed to the split between cost of sales and SG&A although we do manage both of those lines. But as you heard Surya indicate in his prepared remarks, we made some investments in phlebotomists, whether they be in physician's office, whether they be in our patient service centers. We've opened up new PSCs. Those costs all go into cost of sales. So that's where you're seeing some investment dollars right now. Additionally, we indicated that we're accelerating the pace with which we've been converting physicians onto our Care360 and the cost of those conversions, the training, the installation and the like also goes into cost of sales. So as we work down that backlog of physicians waiting to get on and we accelerate the work we've done with that backlog, that adds to some costs in the near term.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: I guess, if these investments are being made, when do we anniversary kind of the [kick-outs]? I mean, is that second half of next year when we'd expect to see that?
Bob Hagemann: Most likely second half of next year is when you'd start to see that anniversary.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup:  The news sales people are in the G&A line?
Bob Hagemann: Yes.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: My next question is just on the Care360, which you guys have talked a lot about and I understand potentially there's some benefits in terms of market share referring to Quest out of that. Can you talk about -- and you touched on it a little bit -- but can you talk about is there any other P&L impacts? Obviously you've just said there's some conversion costs that show up and costs of goods. Presumably the revenue impact is hopefully market share gains on lab testing. Are there other items, subscription fees or licensing or anything that have any material impact on the P&L?
Bob Hagemann: Gary, I will tell you that in terms of revenue for subscription fees and the like we're not expecting that to be material because that's the EHR piece of it. But certainly as people go on to our latest Care360 product we do continue to see benefits on the building side. We get better billing information and the like and that has historically been one of the things that's helped us reduce and manage our bad debt levels. So that's an area as we see more and more electronic connectivity we'll continue to benefit.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: The revenue impact will be market share gains.
Bob Hagemann: Correct.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Hopefully you'll capture more market share from those docs that do the adoption, right?
Bob Hagemann: Precisely.
Operator: Our final question today is from Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just listening to some other questions, I mean, don't you guys do a profound disservice to yourselves breaking out the aggregate price volume metrics? I mean, wouldn't disclosure along the lines of what your competitor reports on a quarterly basis help you better tell your story?
Bob Hagemann: Bob, look, we continue to take a look at what we think is appropriate and at this point we believe that what we're providing is appropriate to help you understand the business, the absolute revenue per acquisition and absolute pricing we think is something that is valuable information that we keep confidential at this point because it is competitive information. We'll continue to try and provide you the information that you need to understand how the business is performing without providing what we believe is sensitive competitive information.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But do you see what one of your competitors is doing as somewhat sensitive information? Are you gleaming much from their disclosure that is helping you and your business? I'm not sure I understand the sensitivity to the breakouts.
Bob Hagemann: We do try to understand it and use whatever public information is available to help us.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: A different area, do you envision that some point -- we've asked for them in the past as the Care360 initiatives really gain more traction, I mean, will there ultimately be some sort of quantitative data you can speak to of 160,000 users, X amount are e-prescribers, X amount are EHR users?
Surya Mohapatra: Yes, we will do that and I think as we gain ground and we're getting established and I think we provide some data as far as how many people are using e-prescription and how many users -- but, Bob, we will look at those things (inaudible).
Bob Hagemann: Bob, as Surya indicated earlier in his prepared remarks, we have over 1000 users on the EHR at this point.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right but sequential builds and anything like that to really help us understand the traction that you have there would be most helpful.
Bob Hagemann: We can do that. As it certainly becomes more meaningful that's something that we would plan to do.

Kathleen Valentine: Thank you and good morning. I’m here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the days that they are made and which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include, but are not limited to adverse results from pending or future government investigations, lawsuits or private actions, the competitive environment, changes in government regulations, changing relationships with customers, payers, suppliers and strategic partners, and other factors described in the Quest Diagnostics 2009 form 10-K, quarterly report on form10-Q and current reports on form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analyses are also available on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you Kathleen. As you saw in our press release this morning, we saw a further slowdown in physician office visits and our revenues declined. Still, we are able to grow our earnings in this environment. During the quarter, earnings per share increased 7% to $1.07, revenue decreased 1.4% to $1.9 billion, cash flow was $209 million. While our business continues to perform well in a number of areas including gene-based and esoteric testing, revenue softness experienced in the first half has made us cautious in our outlook for the full year. We now expect full year revenues to decline by approximately 1% and earnings per share to be between $3.90 and $4.00. Revenue growth continues to be a top priority; we have implemented a number of targeted plans and I will share some elements of these plans later. As you know, we generate significant cash. We continue to explore acquisitions to strengthen our business in the areas of cancer, cardiovascular and infectious disease. We also pursue opportunistic deals which can add scale and be immediately accretive. When acquisitions are not available, we’ll buy back shares as a means to drive shareholder value, which along with dividends is what we have done historically to return cash to shareholders. Now Bob will discuss our financial performance and I will return with additional comments. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann: Thanks Surya. As you’ve heard, revenues during the quarter were impacted by continued softness in the market place. Despite this earnings per share grew 7% in the quarter to $1.07. Revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, 1.4% below the prior year. Our clinical testing revenues which account for over 90% of our total revenues were 1.6% below the prior year compared to our first quarter decline of 0.4%. Note the first quarter growth was reduced by an estimated 1% due to weather. Revenue per requisition was 0.3% below the prior year. Year-over-year revenue per requisition continues to benefit from an increased mix of gene-based and esoteric testing and increases in the number of test quarter per acquisition. This benefit has been offset by some business and pair mixed exchanges, the Medicare fee decrease and pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions. Typically, we will comment just on the year-over-year change in revenue per requisition. But in this quarter it is also important to understand how it has performed sequentially. Revenue per requisition was approximately 1% below the first quarter level with about half of the change due to business and pair mixed exchanges including a rebound in drugs-of-abuse testing and a decline in anatomic pathology testing and about half due to the contract changes referenced earlier. All these contract extensions have involved price adjustments. They have provided us with multi-year visibility in reimbursement rates and have reduced the uncertainty associated with contract expirations. In comparing the year-over-year increase in revenue per requisition reported in the first quarter of 2.3% to the decrease of 0.3% in the second quarter. About 1% of the difference is accounted for by the change from Q1 to Q2 which I just explained. The remainder is principally due to easier comps in the first quarter than in the second. We expect changes in revenue per requisition will continue to be modest for the first half of next year with an anniversary of the business mix, pair mix and contract changes which are currently offsetting the benefits of the increasing proportion of gene-based and esoteric testing. Volume in the second quarter was 1.3% below the prior year and continues to be pressured by the general slowdown in the provisional office business. This compares to a 2.6% decrease in the first quarter. Again, note that weather contributed an estimated 1% to the first quarter decrease. Excluding the first quarter weather impact, volume performance reflected modest improvement in the second quarter principally due to drugs-of-abuse testing which has began to rebound and grew approximately 5% in the quarter. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses which includes risk assessments, clinical trials testing, point-of-care testing and healthcare IT was comparable to the prior year level. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 19.5%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year. Margin improvement was realized despite the slower revenue growth due to progress we are continuing to make in managing our core structure and driving quality improvements. Contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement are reduced costs for performance-based compensation, improved experience associated with professional liability claims and continued progress in reducing bad debt. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8% in the quarter compared to 4.2% last quarter and 4.4% a year ago. BSOs at 42 days are within a day both the year end and a year ago. Cash from operations was $209 million and compares to a $9 million net outflow in last year’s second quarter. Last year’s second quarter contained the NID settlement payment of $308 million, $258 million net of associated tax benefits realized in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the quarter and created $36 million a year ago. During the quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $53.36 for a total of $175 million. We now have $324 million remaining under the $750 million share repurchase authorization granted in January of this year all of which we expect to utilize prior to year end. Our cash balance coupled with our unused lines of credit provides us with significant liquidity and positions us extremely well to capitalize on growth opportunities and take other actions like share repurchases and drive shareholder value. Now let’s turn to our full year outlook from continuing operations. Based on our results through the first half, we’ve become more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year and now expect full year revenues to be approximately 1% below the prior year due principally to our changing outlook for volume. Keep in mind our guidance excludes any acquisitions which may be completed in the second half. We expect operating income to approach 18% of revenues. We now expect cash from operations to be between 1.1 billion and $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion previously. We continue to expect capital expenditures to approximately $200 million. And lastly, diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $3.90 and $4.00 compared to a range of $4.00 to $4.20 previously. While not all of our records through accelerated growth have yet produced results we expected, we are making progress. We have refocused our sales efforts in markets where we believe we have the greatest opportunities, we’ve improved service levels, we have launched, or ready to launch a number of exciting tests and we have added new talented sales personnel. We fully expect these efforts to accelerate growth but they will take time to deliver results. Until then, we will continue to closely manage our costs. In addition, we will continue to explore acquisitions both strategic and opportunistic which we believe will enable us to accelerate long term revenue and earnings growth. Now I’ll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thanks Bob. I would like to elaborate on some of the actions we have taken to drive growth. Last quarter we mentioned that we launched programs to improve our self effectiveness and get closer to our customers. Here is what we have done so far: first we said we are going to upgrade our skills in our sales force and we have added significant talent to the first half of the year. We have targeted high potential sales reps from other healthcare fields, many with specific expertise in key areas such as cancer diagnostics and cardiovascular disease. To make them effective sooner, we have enhanced our training programs and we are giving them advanced tools to better target sales leads. Second, we have targeted specific geographies with the greatest opportunity for growth including areas where competitors are challenged. Third, in some markets we have enhanced our service by adding personnel such as [clavatomists] and service reps where appropriate and opening person service centers. Fourth, we have increased our sales and marketing efforts on tests with the greatest growth potential. These include cancer diagnostics, cardiovascular testing, allergy testing and tests for women’s health. In addition we are leveraging the power of our medical staff to educate customers and provide timely consultation. Every one of these initiatives represents an important opportunity for us to acquire or retain significant business. It is true that some are talking longer to pay off in additional revenues than we would like but we are making progress nonetheless. Now I would like to share progress in esoteric and gene-based testing which continued to grow during the quarter driven largely by sales to hospitals and physician specialists. We saw strong volume growth in vitamin D and our proprietary Lumeta test for leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, we’re pleased with the strong adoption rates of innovative tests we have recently introduced including our AccuType CP test for PLAVIX response and ova 1 for ovarian cancer. Also, our efforts to educate citizens about the benefits of the immunoCAP biology testing resulted in continued strong growth. We’re also having successive hospital customers. We extended our contract with Premier and Caesar Health and signed a new contract with Norvation. These contracts give us the opportunity to grow our hospital business. We provide hospitals a variety of ways to become more effective. Often that means purchasing, managing their outsourcing hospitals outreach laboratory business as we did successfully with the Caritas Health System in the Boston area. We are helping Caritas strengthen its relationship to physicians and the community using our Care360 connectivity solutions. Healthcare IT is a strategic differentiator for us that drives customer loyalty and volume growth. Our Care360 connectivity solutions not only help physicians order tests and receive results, but also allow them to prescribe drugs electronically. Electronic prescribing continues to grow rapidly; 40% in the first half of the year and more than double last year’s rate with an analyzed rate of 18 million drugs. Also, we fully expect that our Care360 EHR will meet the government’s final rules announced lastly to support the meaningful use of EHR. We continue to be encouraged by factors that will drive the long term growth of our business including advances in science and medicine, the ageing of the circulation, increased emphasis on early detection and wellness and the impact of health reform on expanding access. Although the full impact of health reform may not be fully visible for several years, we are preparing for a long-term positive benefit. The latest sign of this came last week in the government’s regulatory announcement that new health plans or those that make significant changes must provide certain preventive screening and other tests to members without any core pay out patient costs. We believe this will expand utilization of important tests that identify disease or risk of disease early when prevention is possible and treatments can be most effective. In closing, our new and extended contracts with health plants and GPOs increase our visibility and reduce uncertainty for future performance. Our esoteric and gene-based testing service continues to show strong growth and we’ll continue to invest in cancer, cardiovascular and infectious disease diagnostics. We are committed to using our strong cash flow to deliver shareholder value through a combination of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions and the buy-back of our shares. The long-term trends are positive for continued industry growth particularly because of the ageing demographics and the government’s focus on prevention and early detection. We are implementing focus action plans to drive near term revenue growths which has the management’s full attention. Thank you, we’ll now take you questions, operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning? Can you really give more details on the pricing from the contract extensions; with these larger deals or a bunch of smaller deals? Any color there?
Robert A. Hagemann: Ralph, this is Bob. Yeah as I said they were several large contracts and the impact in the quarter was about 0.5%. And as you saw…as I indicated earlier, the change in revenue in per acquisition from this quarter to the last is only about 1%; not a significant change but that was one of the factors certainly impacting the comparisons.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Sure. And just to be clear, were these contracts coming up for and all or is this a proactive approach by either you or manage care to sort of extend out the deals?
Robert A. Hagemann: That’s right.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all it is actually a pro-active strategy for us. We have now contracts extended beyond 2012 and it has really made us strong and it has given us the visibility to do imbursement and it has taken over the uncertainty from the market place.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, and so you said sort of beyond 2012 is that sort of and are these again sort of timings, I would’ve bought more sort of front end loaded in terms of beginning earlier this year as opposed to Q2 it just seems kind of all your typical contracts cycle’s in terms of the beginning of they year or do they sort of renew throughout the year and is this sort of a further risk as we kind of move through out the year
Robert A. Hagemann: Ralph there is really no typical cycle as to when in they year they occur, we have contracts coming up all the time. They key is though at this point we have no significant contracts coming up either this year or next year in fact here is really nothing significant coming up for the next 18 to 24 months and even when I look out beyond that at this point, 2012, 2013 the amount of contracts coming up in those periods is less than you typically have in a normal year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then just shifting to the you know AP side things, anything more there that would have caused sort an acceleration in the deterioration, I mean its some thing that we have talked about in the past, just wondering sort it seems to have a more impact in this quarter than maybe in the past so, what would you say is there anything specific, that you think its driving that.
Robert A. Hagemann: Nothing new we should have continued in sourcing of the PC and the PC components of anatomic pathology and that was as I indicated one of the drivers of the change in revenue per requisition as well, that’s a richer priced wreck and yes that business as impacted, if does impact the total revenue per requisition because of the mixed change there.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay great and then just my last one, you were able to obviously meet the bottom line this quarter, based on consensus numbers despite the top line weakness you took down the guidance you had sort of 19.5% plus margins and you are sort of targeting the 18% levels, so I guess the question what is it that you can’t sort of replicate cost going forward and kind of continue what you did sort of in the second quarter, is it more that the top line is going to get maybe a little bit weaker is there something on the core side that you think is unsustainable.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yeah, with respect to the cost there are several things that took place in this quarter that while we expect them to continue to benefit us we won’t have the same benefit that they did in the second quarter. For example as I said we made changes to the incentives or performance based come across we did see very good experience in our professional liability claims and we hand very good experience and bad debt. I expect the experience and bad debt will continue and I think we’ll continue to benefit from the changes we’ve made to reduce professional liability claims, but we are not going to have the same benefits over the back half of the year that we saw in the second quarter.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, alright thank you.
Operator: Thank you the next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk – Piper Jaffray: Yeah thanks, good morning guys, was wondering if you could comment Surya just on the recent FDA meeting on laboratory developed test, what that means for Quest, and how we should think about some of your own laboratory developed tests that you are going to be looking at moving to a manufactured kit or would you actually consider taking some of your products to FDA, thank you.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Now that’s a good question, our goal is the same as FDA goal we want to really create Test which are clinically tested and analytically valid and the only concern we have and we are working with our trade association and working with FDA that most of the test are laboratory developed test which brings innovation to the market place and we are regulated by clear and if we are not careful we don’t want FDA to over regulate us which will stop innovation and also not bring test to the market place so we are working with them to make sure what test are risky and obviously it has been exaggerated because some of these companies none are providing genetic testing. So I believe that we’ll come to a place where there will be a balanced between laboratory producing not very high quality test and the test which are not validated and the test which are high risk verses the majority of test which are safe and helping patients. Now as far as our company is concern we are very fortunate that we have lots of experience in creating products like H1N1 and other tests which we know how to go through the FDA, so obviously what about the position FDA takes we are very well positioned with the laboratory developed test and the test which might become caves because of our experience to focused diagnosing.
William Quirk – Piper Jaffray: And so just as a quick follow up Surya, is it safe to say it is little too early from your perspective to start ticking down a list of what test we might transition to a kit verses what we might take to FDA.
Surya N. Mohapatra: It is too early and I think there’s quite a bit of work to be done and I think FDA is having this hearing and we are working with them.
William Quirk – Piper Jaffray: Okay, very good thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Good morning thank you, I guess I was just hoping we could maybe frame the manage care renewal issue a little bit more. Bob can you talk a little may be what percent of the business was renewed so that we can understand the magnitude of the impact here.
Robert A. Hagemann: Well to give you a sense over the course over the last 18 months or so we have renewed the vast majority of our manage care business. All of the large plans and as I said we have very little coming up in the second half of this year we have a negligible amount coming up in 2011 and as I look at 2012, and even 2013 the amount that is coming for renewals in those periods is significantly less than we would typically have in any one year.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann: So we’ve renewed this for generally 3 to 5 years periods, or extended them for generally to 3 to 5 years period and as Surya said it give us very good visibility in to what reimbursement is and takes the uncertainty out of having to go through contract renewals and determine whether you are going to continue to be on contract.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: I guess just, go ahead.
Surya N. Mohapatra: I mean this is Surya. One of the most important things you are to know that we feel very strong and very confident in this proactive strategy to get all the manage care contracts behind us and that gives the opportunity to do work with the manage care plans, work with the [Leekays] and work in the market place selling our valid propositions rather than always getting worried about the uncertainty of the manage care contract expiration. So I feel personally this is really a great achievement for us this is really positioning our company in a better place than ever before.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Tom I just add one thing to as you think about manage care the real opportunity continues to be to work with the plan to drive more volume in network to lower cost providers like ourselves.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Right, I guess I understand sort of all the positives I am just sort of curious how you are viewing the competitive landscape, if it we are sort of renewing things and that equals visibility, but it’s on lower reimbursement apparently. I guess how do you sort of see the competitive environment and how do you sort of see - how were you thinking about the risks that were out there that made you want to sign a contract early at a lower price.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well first of all its all about bringing stability to the market place, few years ago we went through a situation where the market was unstable and we had to do what we had to do to establish our position and bring back the market to stable condition. And yes every manage care contract is different and when you have multi year contracts you give some concession, but you also count on increasing you volume and I think the only reason why you see this price decrease this quarter because obviously there is a slow down in the volume. But when I look at the competitive landscape, first of all it’s the same as before but we have taken out a major uncertainty out which will help us move forward working with them to improve, reduce that and improve our volume. So I think in the long run this is going to help us more and I think the competitive landscape is more stable now with this contract singed.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay if I could just ask you two more things about this Bob you mentioned in the last 18 months you renewed a vast majority, but we saw an incremental pressure in this quarter, so was there a lot that started during the quarter or at the beginning of the quarter or can you just make us understand why all of a sudden we are starting to see and I guess the other aspect of it is what are you seeing out there in terms of exclusive verses none exclusive type contracts, thank you.
Robert A. Hagemann: Okay, well first let’s remember that the change in revenue per requisition from Q1 to Q2 was not significant it was about 1% so and typically the change from any one quarter to the next quarter is not significant. Driving the change with Q1 to Q2 was business in paramedics as I mentioned so that’s about half of it and only about half of it were the contracts price changes that went into effect in this quarter. |Now as I said we had some renewals last year and some cases they were price adjustments on those as well but they’ve already been reflected in our numbers. What makes the revenue correct change in the quarter stand out is really have the comparison to the prior you change between Q1 and Q2.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann: There was essentially a 2.6% swing comparing with a 2.3% increase that we saw on Q1 with a 0.3% decrease that we see this quarter and 1% is the absolute change in revenue per requisition in Q1 to Q2 if that I just explained.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann: The main year is principally due to easier comps in Q1 verses the prior year and at this point we are expecting the revenue per requisition to be relatively stable over the course of the rest of the year and in to the early part of next year.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: In terms of absolute dollars.
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Right, and just about exclusivity verses non-exclusivity there was some talk about Empire and some others out there.
Robert A. Hagemann: Look, I think each plan has a different view as to what they’d like to archive some obviously like broader network some have used some broader networks and in each case we try to work with the plan to help them accomplish what there goals are and I would tell you that we do have opened contracts where we are very comfortable competing for business in open networks will be very effective where we’ve had that and we expect to continue to be effective.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: The next question from Amanda Murphy with William Blair
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Hi good morning, just another sorry another question on this mange care situation I’m just it sounds like you’ve been sort of pursuing a proactive renewal process for some time so I’m trying to get a handle on what changed since you gave guidance the last quarter for revenue is it or was it reduction in guidance driven primarily by volume this quarter.
Robert A. Hagemann: Amanda the changing guidance is due principally to our change in out look for volume. We did not anticitipate the further slow down in patient visits and we expected frankly that some of the plans that we’ve put in place would have delivered more at this point.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Okay and then just how have you gone through this process just following up to a previous question were there any new contracts that you obtained that you did not have before.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well we had a new hospital contracts Novation, we extended premium contracts and also Kaiser Health so that hospital business is doing well and we are gaining ground there. And again about the manage care contracts and working with the manage care our relationship with the manage care organizations are good and as Bob we are working with the needs and what I feel very excited about is that we don’t have those worries for the next 2 or 3 years.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Okay, and then just last question you gave us some color on esoteric side of the business I am curious, could you specifically to [antonic] pathology how that business is performing maybe relative to last quarter is it sort if getting better or worser or worser or the same.
Robert A. Hagemann: Well Amanda as I said earlier we saw a continued softness there and actually a little more than we had the first quarters and that was one of the contributors to the change in revenue per requisition again that business is more often a little more because if we continued in-sourcing, Harry’s higher revenue per requisition. On flip side we saw growth, drugs of abuse testing there is this which carries lower revenue per requisition so again that was one of the dynamics that you saw going on this quarter.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair: Okay thanks a lot.
Operator: The next is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Yeah, good morning.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Good morning.
Robert A. Hagemann: Good morning.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: I have a few thought questions first of all just to clarify for modeling purposes, on the average revenue per requisition Bob you were saying that in absolute dollar terms revenue per requisition is going to be stable in the second half of the year, but the metrics that you provided us in your report is a growth rate so from a growth rate perspective what should we expect in second half of ‘10 about the pricing metric.
Robert A. Hagemann: Now Ricky as you know we don’t give the components of revenue guidance in terms of revenue per requisition in volume what I would tell though is that I don’t expect the variance from the prior years to fluctuate much more than a percent either way.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: But again just to clarify if you think about the prior year, when you are saying that the variance is not going to fluctuate by more than 1% for example in Q3 of 09’ you recorded a 4.3% year-over-year growth number, so when you are saying that its not going to fluctuate, its not going to fluctuate from the growth rate or its not going to fluctuate from the absolute price number in the first quarter which you really don’t provide us.
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky I think I gave you the answer to both of those I said that the absolute number we don’t expect to change significantly over the course of the year and we expect that to result in a variance for the prior year which is generally not more than about 1% .
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay Bob, let me ask you the question differently, if you look back in 2009 and you look at the pricing number the revenue per requisition in the absolute dollar value right you think that its 3Q 09’ on an absolute dollars basis was higher or lower than 2Q 09’.
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky I would expect that we are probably higher now but I don’t have the data as you know that’s not a metric that we disclose.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Alright we can turn back at the call but it really is not what it is now its more of what it was last year because if you just give us kind of like just the direction in whether 3Q 09’ revenue per requisition was higher or low in Q2 09’ revenue per requisition I think that would be just very helpful in helping us model the second half of the year but we can take that offline.
Robert A. Hagemann: Okay.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Okay.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: The other question is again when you think about your top line guidance for the year what percent of the guidance provision is related to the changes of pricing verses volume.
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky as I said earlier the majority of it is related to our change in outlook for volume there is a little bit in there in terms of revenue correct but its mostly driven by the mix changes, certainly all the contracts changes we had anticipated and had built in to our earlier values.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And then finally just in terms of the contracts most of these recent contracts extensions are there scheduled renewals or are they kind of like midterm renewals due to a competitive environment because if I recall correctly last time we went through a large contract cycle with the 2007, 2008 period back then you guys said that most of the big contracts goes five years in turn which would take us to 2012 so was there something that was out of the normal cycle.
Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all Ricky as I said this is a pro-active strategy we work with the health plans and yes it is pro-actively extended before its due cycle.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: With the schedule cycle.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well we extended before its expiration
Robert A. Hagemann: Ricky it’s a combination of both, we always have contracts coming up but it many cases as Surya said we were pro-active in extending contracts way before they were coming up for renewal.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay that’s very helpful thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, the next question is from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Thanks good morning everybody, I guess I just wanted to follow up one more on the manage care contracting effort especially with regard to terms and we went through obviously a cycle post 2007 when there were escalators built into the contracts at various times, I am just trying to get an understanding seems like you reset some of your contracts lower or do we still have a period of time during the 3 to 5 year cycle where we are going to see positive escalators or have you built in negative escalators. Can you just give us the general frame work for terms?
Robert A. Hagemann: Darren, I think we’ve said historically every contract is are little different certainly some of these we have escalators built in, others we may have further volume discounts built in to it, but in each case you know as we think about the opportunity with these health plan contracts, the real sizable opportunity for us is to drive more work into network, and the other health plans and employers are much more receptive to that than they have been in the past and I think that’s the opportunity that’s now created for us with these extensions because we have long term relationships locked up. We can begin to effectively develop plans that we can execute over the next several years to drive more work in networking and as Surya said drive volume for us.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: So if I’m to understand what you are saying, in just comparing the last three years to perhaps the next three years relative to the batch of contracts, the last 3years could be characterized by slightly positive escalators on balance as you look at the manage care book and the next 3years the focus is more about volume and driving in networks as opposed to positive escalators, is that a fair statement?
Robert A. Hagemann: Darren, I’m not sure that if I look back over the last few years I would characterize those renewals as having lots of positive escalators in them, I think that the opportunity that we saw now to extend contracts was similar to what we had in the past, but this was much more proactive I will tell you and given the uncertainty across healthcare associated with healthcare reform we felt that this was a very appropriate thing for us to do.
 Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank:
 :
 :
Robert A. Hagemann:
 : Danny, here is what I will tell you, first of all the investments that we’re making and plan to make over the remainder of the year are fully built into our guidance, and also the investments that we are making in sales and service are designed to accelerate growth. So these are all investments in growth, there is still a big part of the business that has opportunities for us to continue driving efficiencies which we’ll continue doing there. So as I think about it, yes there are investments in some areas they’ll increase costs but we fully expect them to be items that will help us accelerate growth as well.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Ok, and then if I would just ask a question I think I know the answer but I think helpful to get a media look at your revenue by product category just in broad brushes of growth rates, it’s very difficult for us to assess what’s really driving your revenue trends by product category especially with all the changes in drugs as abuse and would appears to be a pretty big slow down in AP. So I don’t know if you are willing to do that here but I think it would be useful for us just to in broad strokes give us a sense for where this product categories have trended on year to day basis in percentage terms.
Kathleen Valentine : Darren, this is Cathleen. What I can tell you without giving you the explicit percentages is that team basements into our testing grew nicely and through in the quarter and through the first half. Our drugs produce business is growing up, is growing and as you heard AP is trending down. So that should give you some nice color in terms of how those businesses are performing mid year.
Robert A. Hagemann: We did give some color in my prepare remarks that the drugs of abuse testing business volumes grew about 5% or so.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Right and so AP was down 1% roughly last year on an annual basis; it’s fair to say that got worse in both the first and the second quarter relative to that figure.
Robert A. Hagemann: That’s true, yes.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Ok and I guess my last question will be for Surya and I’ll jump off but I just wondered – seeing your comments on MNA obviously that’s still a priority in terms of growth in deploying capital but I think what you said Surya was when MNA is not available you’re going to pursue buy back, you’ve now been three quarters pursuing buy back very aggressively. So I wanted to understand what sort of underneath that of that action which is a statement as well, is it about pricing in the MNA environment? Is it about availability of assets? What is it that’s keeping you on the sidelines?
Surya Mohapatra: Ok, well it’s not keeping me on the sideline, we are a very active participant in the MNA market. What we are not going to do is get anxious buyers and as you know as Bob said that our top line growth does not include acquisitions, so it’s all organic growth. But our growth strategy has not changed, we have organic growth and inorganic growth and we are looking for acquisitions which make sense to us and it has to be either immediately accretive because it is scale and it is scale audit, we buy capability which is a long term strategic acquisition in cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. So we look at acquisition very careful, we are a disciplined buyer and when we don’t get then we know we return shareholders, return cash to share holders through share buy back and we have done those things with dividends. So our philosophy has not changed, and we continually look at what is available in the market place.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Ok, thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Ellich with RBC Capital Markets.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to clarify and Bob you gave a lot of good detail, but I just wanted to clarify the contract pricing, that’s not new, that was something that was previously in your guidance?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct, that was all baked into our previous guidance, there were no surprises there.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Ok, I understand and then on the volume side with the weaker position offices being the primary corporate for the lowest guidance, is any of your lower volume attributed to the contract changes like empire BlueCross BlueShield?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, it’s not again, we recognized earlier on when we did the last guidance step that it was going to be an open contract so any potential changes their were built in, all those I told you, we feel very comfortable competing in an open contract and getting our fair share, not more than our fair share of the work here.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Ok, and then Surya, maybe could we get to your updated thoughts on the anatomic pathology and the histology pressure, I mean that’s been something that’s been persistent for a while with the in sourcing by position, where does this stand with the government? Are you expecting them to do anything and what can you do?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, again a very good question. First of all cancer is a growth area and we have invested a lot in cancer and we know that this is going to help us to go in the market place. Now as far as AP reduction, as you know and having a lot of in sourcing both TC and PC and we are working with a number of Trade Association, American College of Pathologists and we know that when it’s in sourced the utilizism has grown up. So we are working with the Trade Association and we’ll work with the government to make our case because to do in sourcing and to have over utilized and is not good for the patient and certainly not good for our business. So we are very actively involved in this thing to provide appropriate data.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay and we don’t have any expectations or time frame as to when something might happen?
Surya Mohapatra: Well these things takes time, but I know that it is a short term, it’s a temporary issue and we are putting proposals but it will take some time but I am very confident that it is going to be fixed. One other thing I want to add about the volume because 80% of our business comes from the doctor’s office, and as you know our volume this quarter was down by 1.3% but the doctors’ office visit was down by almost 4.5%, so obviously that has really affected us and that’s the reason why we have this four point plan to reverse the trend by increasing our sales and service and frankly going up to market share.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Got you, and do you think you know, I know that there is a question about competitive landscape, have you seen increased competition from hospital, outreach programs or where do you think that stands now?
Surya Mohapatra:
e :
 :
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Understood, and then thinking about the acquisition market and the international market, just wondering where your thoughts lie in terms of expanding more broadly internationally.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, we have our hands full at the moment in the US and the whole management attention is to revenue, growth and reverse the trend and we are not very happy with the second quarter results, we did not perform the way we wanted to. So almost all of our attention now is on revenue. Now having said that, we have some medium term and long term investments as you know in other businesses and one of them is India and we are focused and I think medium term it will produce, it will give us better results and but at the moment we are just focused in the US.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Ok, and then just one last follow up to Bob, going back to the contracting with manage care or something, I just want to make sure that I get this right, you guys are not seeing pricing pressured from the manage care company?
Robert A. Hagemann: I’m not sure how you can conclude that based upon what I said. Now we absolutely are. I think every provider in health care is under pressure to reduce their cost and we are working with the plans to help them achieve their goals of not only reduce cost but in some cases broader access.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Understood, ok thanks guys.
Operator: The next question’s from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group:
 :
 :
Robert A. Hagemann: Anthony, I want to be careful in speculating to what this means to the broad of the economy and the like. We are encouraged by the fact that we did see an uptake there and certainly some of it is as a result of improved hiring, although as everybody knows, that’s not ramping up the way most people had hoped. So I see it as a positive indicator but I think it’s too early to tell whether or not it’s something sustainable and bodes well for the broader economy at this point.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Ok, and then on the contracts, can you -- by saying that those significant contracts are up for renewal in the next 18 to 24 months or not even major ones in 2012 or 2013, can we infer that the [Ecna] contract has been extended and if so is that still on a somewhat exclusive basis where [Lab Corp] can’t be used?
Robert A. Hagemann: It has been extended for multiple years, at this point that was extended last year and we will maintain our position as the exclusive national laboratory on that contract.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Ok great, and in the past you’ve talked about the international expansions, are those expansions that you’re looking at internationally both internally and externally?
Surya Mohapatra:
 :
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Ok, and just in terms of the hospital business, I know you said some of them are trying to monetize what they are doing, but where are you seeing that trending towards, are they trying to hold on to more of that business or you know or are they looking to outsource it, are you providing, you’re providing that service that they find attractive enough to do that? Or are they really trying to hold on to that business? Where is that moving in your view?
Surya Mohapatra: Well I think like all of those hospitals are also looking at what will be their poison when the health care reform is fully implemented? So some hospitals over the years have been buying medical practices. That doesn’t mean that all of those practices are sending the results to them. Some hospitals have done outreach but as you know some of them are selling those things because they don’t want to invest more capital. So I think we see a number of ways to work with hospitals, first we help them in reference testing business, second we can really buy that outreach business and provide them healthcare, IT to improve their relationship with the community and the third sometime we provide support for their quality and efficiency lot. So hospital is a major player in this market and I’m glad we are doing well and we are building a relationship with them .
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Ok, but that right now is only about 20% of your business, right?
Kathleen Valentine : Yeah, it’s a little less
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Okay.
Surya Mohapatra: But it has grown
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Okay great, alright thank you.
Robert A. Hagemann: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay thank you, good morning everyone. Maybe just back to a comment you made about the doctor office visits, you said they were down 4 to 5%, was just curious what data source you’re using for that, just want to be sure I heard that correctly in response to question Surya you made reference to it.
Surya Mohapatra: We use IMS data and some analyst report also, bur IMS provides the doctor service visits.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay, and I guess just going into that point in more detail, I mean what are you hearing from doctors and I mean this is clearly weaker than what it typically is, it tends to be pretty stable. So what are you guys hearing in the field? I know your guidance witness fairly incorporate any sort of big tick up, but clearly since it’s more of a temporary issue but curious to get your thoughts, do you think we could have this sluggish visits for the next 12 to 24 months and just curious any feedback you guys are hearing.
Surya Mohapatra: Well first of all we are using the doctors’ visits as a proxy for what is happening in our volume because we don’t have the data, but we know that 80% of our business comes from the doctors’ office and I think what we hear and what we see and we don’t know exactly what the reason why people extended have their visits between the frequency of the visits have been reduced. But having said that esoteric and gene based testing has grown. So I think the impact is in the routine testing and to be perfectly honest am glad that we started a diversification going towards our esoteric and gene and AP 4 or 5 years ago and we have invested money and we are growing. So there is no slowness, no significant slowness in gene and esoteric based testing , there is some delay in the routine testing.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Ok, alright and just to follow up on the pricing side and Surya I know you talked about it a lot, sorry to go back into it, but I guess just to frame it here, I mean we went through a big industry reprising in 2007, it was a big overhang issue and then as fairly things were very stable in 2008 and 2009 and even through the beginning of 2010, just from hearing your comments now I mean certainly you guys are being more proactive in trying to go out to renew contracts but clearly it sounds like the pressure has picked up which shouldn’t be a shocker with some of the issues in manage care here, but I guess it just kind of, the feedback has been very positive around the manage care landscape and it sounds like that changed pretty fast. So once again if you think about it that way I guess the catalyst for the change here, just curious to get some of the additional feedback there.
Surya Mohapatra: Ok, well first of all it did not change fast, it is a very organized proactive strategy from Quest Diagnostics to really create a stable market for the industry and for us, but with the healthcare reform of the background, we had an opportunity to do work with the health plans like they are working with us, and we are all working together and that gives us an opportunity to drive the strategy and to take all this uncertainty away. Now having said that as Bob said there is always personal pricing, but it doesn’t really matter the results of the rest of the laboratories. These uncertainties are not there because there’s always this issue which national player are going to exclusive and non-exclusive. Now it is more or less for us, it’s a very stable industry and it’s a very stable market and we are now posting [inaudible]. So I don’t want you to understand that there is this pressure going up and it is hitting, it’s not actually. It’s actually you are now realizing because these things are now effective.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay so Surya if I can just go back there so you are saying we shouldn’t view this the way we would have viewed 2007 in terms of what was happening with industry pricing during that time period.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Not at all.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay, alright. And then just finally and I know you guys don’t comment on contracts typically, but there has been a lot of focus on this Empire contract, a few people have asked about it. Can you say anything about that contract just and clearly it would be helpful since there has been a lot of chatter about it.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yeah, alright I did mention something briefly before Adam that with Empire they were looking to broaden their network, we worked with them to help them achieve that. Not all the payers go that route some like more restrictive networks and in this case Empire felt that it would make their network more attractive by having it broader and we worked with them to put now a new long term contract in place that provides that to them. And as I said earlier we feel very confident that we can effectively provision this in open contracts.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay, great. Alright thank you very much, appreciate it.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Kemp Dolliver with Avondale Partners.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Alright, thanks and good morning. A couple of questions again mainly around your thoughts on manage care, but first are you making any different assumptions about what you can do with prime mix on these contracts versus prior contracts.
Robert A. Hagemann: It’s not prime mix per say, as I said earlier the plans and employers now are much more willing to take action as to drive work in network to lower cost providers like ourselves and that’s what the opportunity is with these health plans. Is to work with them and the employers to design approaches that will drive more work in network and obviously we will then be the beneficiary of that.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners : Any data with regard - the subject of in network, out of network has been around I think as long as I’ve been covering the industry, but I haven’t heard any data with regard to say how much business is out of the network now versus what may have been out network 5 or 10 years ago. Do you have any thoughts on that?
Robert A. Hagemann: I would tell you the vast majority of our business is contracted and as a result this whole effort by health plans to drive more into network I think is going to be a significant positive to us. I would tell you that it’s probably in terms of – in network out of network not significantly different than it was a number of years ago although I don’t have good data at my fingertips to validate that.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners : Okay, good and how is this going to manifest itself because you’ve made these renewals, most people don’t go into new enrolments. The enrolment cycle for the individual doesn’t kick in until January 1st, there is talk of intra – here at least the plans are pushing narrow networks and the like, but that’s such a sea change from where employers have been for the last you know decade or so. What do you really – I guess what are the things we are likely to see with planned designed and the like that would make this a balanced strategy for you.
Robert A. Hagemann: It’s hard to say and it’s continuing to evolve, but you’ve probably seen some of it already in terms of increased co pays in deductibles for out of network services, sometimes no co pays of deductibles for in network. There are also incentives to drive employees in networks. So I think yeah every employer has a slightly different approach, but those seemed to be genera themes that you see.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Okay, super and one more mundane question is on what – how did your non clinical testing business perform this quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: As we said revenues were essentially flat with the prior year in this quarter. Some of that, the point of care testing business is affected by the same things that impact the laboratory testing business.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Okay, currency any significant factor?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, we would have broken that out if it was.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Thanks, very much.
Operator: The next question is from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Hi, good morning.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Morning.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: A few different questions, various topics and I appreciate your patience because I am going to go back to the prime mix thing I just want to understand that a little better. So what we saw in the 2Q here sequentially with the proactive renewals, was this a single sizeable thing? Was this several contracts or one big contract and other small ones or a few small ones, can you help us understand that?
Robert A. Hagemann: As I said there are several contacts that are impacting the comparisons to the prior year. In the comparison to the prior quarter we are only talking about a 0.5% change.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Correct, but is it still sequentially they were renewals or -.
Robert A. Hagemann: Alright, we had one going to effect April 1 that drove much of the difference between Q1 and Q2.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: And I guess I’m just trying to think about the math, down 1% sequentially half of that related to contract renewals for about 50 basis points, but manage care is about half your revenue so if you had for example 10% of your manage care both renewing down 10% that would be about 50 basis point of pricing pressure on your overall revenue per session, but it doesn’t sound like you are down 10 – I’m just ball parking. But down 10 would be a pretty sizeable reduction, it doesn’t seem like you’re – I’m sure you don’t want to get into sort of discounts that you’ve given, but I’m not sure it seems like you are characterizing the way a great environment is, is that adverse. So can you help me kind of think about how a couple of contracts skew the whole book 50 basis points sequentially. Am I doing my math wrong?
Robert A. Hagemann: Well if you think about what 50 basis points is on our book of business, that is in the range of $30 million or so on annual basis so that gives you some sense s to what the impact is in the quarter. I’m not sure what else I can share with you.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yeah, it’s a small number overall, but if only a small amount renewed it seemed like I guess a big hit for the percent is then renewed.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yeah, I guess what you have to recognize now is as we said these big renewals are all behind us; these big renewals and extensions so in terms of going forward we feel as though we have very good stability in revenue-per-requisition. I think what continues to drive changes in revenue-per-requisition you know on the positive side we got the gene-based and esoteric testing continuing to grow. Potentially on the negative side we continue to have makeshifts, right.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yep.
Robert A. Hagemann: So, those I think will be the two drivers of revenue-per-requisition going forward and much less you know contract changes and pricing changes associated with that.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Is it, I guess because it’s there so these renewals have been ongoing for a year or so or more and maybe we’ve missed some of that impact because of other things influencing revenue-per-requisition. Is it fair to say that, that renewal on April 1st was I guess the worst because it’s really the only one filled out.
Robert A. Hagemann: Gary I’m not going characterize that for you.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yeah, and then you have talked about your forward view a little bit, I guess maybe looking beyond what you said about the rest of the year are on a dollar basis per requisition looking pretty stable as we just kind of think about the next 2 or 3 years most of the commercial books is locked in. right now unless PPI picks up Medicare is down slightly some of your commercial contracts have some escalators some don’t. So looking out the next 2 or 3 years is there reason to feel that worse than relatively stable is the right way to characterize that or is relatively stable probably the right outlook right now.
Robert A. Hagemann: Yeah, well again I want to be careful not to give long term guidance on revenue-per-requisition, but here are some of the factors that are going to drive it. I think Medicare, certainly next year we expect to see a further reduction in Medicare reimbursement and I think you’ll understand that the way that Medicare reimbursement will work over the next several years or so is that there will be CPI increases they will be off set though by productivity adjustments which can’t take them down below zero. And then whatever that number is will be reduced by 1.75% over the course of the next 5 years or so.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Alright.
Robert A. Hagemann: And then, the positive drivers of revenue-per-requisition are going to continue to be test mix, gene-based and esoteric testing and probably increased utilization so increased number of tests ordered per requisition. And then we always have the mix of business that can influence it one way or another.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Real quickly any chance you could characterize how big of a business Empire is for you right now.
Robert A. Hagemann: We do not give specifics on any particular contract.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, last question can you just help us on ending basic included obviously we have the average share count in the release, but just for modeling you have ending numbers right there.
Robert A. Hagemann: It should be right on the balance sheet.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann: Underneath the balance sheet you can do the math there right just looking at the issue less the amount treasured to get to the outstanding number.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, alright thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Leeberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Leeberman – Wells Fargo: Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the comments around the pricing, I guess I’m still struggling to understand though how the strategy of effectively competing on price with the contracts is going to bring more stability to the market place, because the history of it is it does the opposite and so I guess just help me understand how it actually brings stability to the market place.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Gary this is Surya, first of all having extended contract guarantees us the access to the market place. Knowing that what the healthcare reform is going on and the changes and we want to just make sure that we have long term contracts and we work with health plans. So the first of all is the worry about who is the national player, who will play the worry about actually how do you really work with the health plan goes away because we don’t have those contract renewals. Now as far as pricing is concerned as you know some contracts will have escalators some contracts will not, but the most important thing is now the employers and the health plans are working with us and with the industry to drive more business to network. So these things what we are talking about here today would not have been relevant if our volume would have been higher. So obviously we feel the stability is here because we – now we are in computer based and value properties and we know what the pricing is, we know what we have to do to increase our market share, increase our volume and that’s the reason why I said I feel pretty strong about the next couple of years. Not worry about Medicare contract renewal or something.
Robert A. Hagemann: There is a big difference between pursuing exclusive arrangements with very low price and extending arrangements and locking up access over a period of time.
Gary Leeberman – Wells Fargo: But my fault to that point would be it’s a competitive market place so it’s great that you guys have open access to the contract, but others will as well and what’s preventing them from competing on price as well and then don’t you guys go down or risk going down, sort of the spiral that hurt the industry in past.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well that has been there all the time there is always what you call negotiation with the Medicare or hospital and everybody is looking for price, but as I said that having major contract negotiated and as Bob said not going for the lowest price to get the contract and extension is actually a much safer and much better than not having the contract.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Gary just to be clear, pricing historically in many places by competitors had been used to gain access and limit our access. Once multiple providers are on contract their pricing is set by contract at that point and then you are principally competing based upon service. So you really are not – the only time you are competing on price really at the end of day is when you are competing for access to the contract.
Gary Leeberman – Wells Fargo: Okay, so I guess would it be safe to say you don’t believe you are the lowest cost provider, but you are just competitive so there is less risk to kind of a pricing instability here.
Robert A. Hagemann: Well as I said we are one of the low cost providers on contract and yeah as a result when you think about out of network spending what goes to hospitals, what goes to non contracted laboratories which is often at rates 2 to 3 times what we contracted at which is a real incentive for the health plans and for employers to drive more work in network. The other thing I would tell you is when the work is going to contracted providers usually the data that flows back and forth between the provider of the health plan and the employer is much better and as they are looking to do things with Wellness plans and disease management and the like that’s another advantage that in network providers get health plans on employers.
Gary Leeberman – Wells Fargo: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our final question will come from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Bob or Surya you guys don’t break out your volume trends by segment on a quarterly basis as your competitor does, but I have to believe your histology trends are probably similar and I guess with the Ameri Path deal making pathology a much bigger part of business if that’s not growing isn’t that a more challenging situation for you I mean much of the guidance per revenues going forward reflects that histology volume continuing to decline and how do you stop it and do we revisit that Ameri Path deal and is there anything tangible associated with it that might be impaired.
Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all it is really unfortunate that what’s happening in the market place is not good for the industry not good for the patients because the TCNPC internalize is driving over utilizing so we are working with the trade associations and I hope that it’s going to – there will be some legislation or probably change, but meanwhile we are actually having difficulties because that trend has gone down, but we have taken that into account in our guidance. And the other thing we are trying to do which is combining the histology with molecular diagnostic, but we have included the deterioration of the histology market in our guidance.
Robert A. Hagemann: And Bob we are not anticipating any impairment charge.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: What we vision today though is that reflecting another step down in that business or was that anticipated also at the beginning of the year?
Robert A. Hagemann: It does reflect a little further softness than we were expecting at the beginning of the year.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And I guess on the Empire deal that folks have mentioned I mean it isn’t exclusive going to an open contract so there will be some losses associated here and some of your competitors have positioned themselves in the market with acquisitions. Can you give us any sense of -- I mean you just said you’ll compete for your fair share of business, but you are losing something here. Any magnitude that you can or what have you assumed losses would be.
Robert A. Hagemann: Bob, yeah as I said yeah and I’ll repeat I think we feel very good about competing in the market place to the degree that there is any change in volume associated with now further access to the contract by others we’ve built that into our guidance.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, that’s it. Thank you.
Robert A. Hagemann: Thank you.

Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speaks only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations, or beliefs, and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different.

A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly updates section of our Web site at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the Web site. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Kathleen. Our business remained strong despite being negatively impacted by severe weather and softness in the market place. During the first quarter, revenues were $1.8 billion, earnings per share were $0.89, and cash from operations totaled $239 million. Our full-year EPS guidance remains unchanged after adjusting for the first quarter charge and the impact of severe weather. We saw continued growth in gene-based and esoteric testing, and we are taking actions to accelerate revenue growth and manage our costs. I'll review our progress after Bob discusses out financial performance. Bob?
Bob Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. During the quarter, we saw a slowing in our growth due to severe weather, softness in the market place and reduced reimbursement for Medicare. Despite these challenges, our business remained strong. It has continued to grow on the line earnings and generated strong cash flow. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.89 equal to the prior year. The earnings comparison is impacted by a $0.06 charge recorded in the quarter associated with work force reductions, and $0.05 associated with the estimated impact of severe weather across much of the country. Revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion in line with the prior year. Revenue growth was reduced by an estimated 1% due to the impact of severe weather. Our clinical testing revenues, which account for over 90% of our total revenues were within 0.5% of the prior year and grew about 1% adjusted to the impact of weather. Reported volume was 2.6% below the prior year end level and reflects an estimated 1% reduction due to weather. Drug testing volumes have stabilized and are no longer impacting revenue and volume comparisons. Overall, volumes are being pressured by a general slowdown in traditional office visits. We are aggressively addressing this challenge. We have increased our focus on effective sales execution and are expanding the capabilities of our sales force. In addition, we are adjusting our cost structure to match volume levels. Revenue per requisition increased 2.3% with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix partially offset by the 1.9% Medicare fee decrease, which went into effect January 1, and served to reduce revenue per requisition by about 0.5%. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, point-of-care testing and health care IT, and it contains most of our international revenues grew 3% in the quarter principally due to favorable foreign exchange. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 16.5% compared to 17.8% last year. The charge recorded in the quarter and the impact of weather combined to reduce the year-over-year change in operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1.6%. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.2% compared to 4.5% a year ago. DSOs at 41 days improved two days for both year end and a year ago. Our cash flow continued to be strong. Cash flow from operations was $239 million and compares to $273 million in last year's first quarter. The decrease is principally due to the timing of annual incentive things. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. During the quarter we repurchased $4.5 million of our shares at an average price of $56.21 for a total of $251 million under the accelerated share repurchase we announced in January. Our cash balance, coupled with our unused credit lines, provides us with a significant liquidity and positions us extremely well to capitalize on growth opportunity and take other actions like share repurchases to drive shareholder value. Now, let's turn to our full year outlook from continuing operations. We now expect revenue growth of between 1% and 2%. We expect operating income, which now reflects the first quarter charge and weather impact to approximate 18.5% as a percentage of revenues. We continue to expect cash from operations to approximate $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to approximate $200 million. And lastly, diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $4 and $4.20 on a reported basis, and between $4.10 and $4.30 adjusted for the impact of charges in weather in the first quarter. We are taking actions to accelerate our growth and we expect these efforts to lead to improvement as the year progresses and we continue to be very excited about the prospects for our business. Now, I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks Bob. During the quarter, we saw positive growth from innovative tests such as vitamin D and ImmunoCAP allergy testing. Our esoteric laboratory saw stronger growth in our routine testing. Additionally, over the course of recent month, we have extended a number of contracts with the health plans increasing visibility to our forefronts. In this environment, it is important to increase our sales effectiveness and have a higher level of customer engagements. We are putting plans in place to achieve that by upgrading our sales talent and adding refs in some markets. We continue to pursue our strategy of rising differentiation through innovative tests and services that create competitive advantage and will drive future growth. In March, we and Vermillion launched OVA1, the first blood test cleared by the FDA for pre-surgical evaluation of an ovarian mass for cancer. The response has been very positive. We are pleased that Medicare is covering this test. AccuType CP is our new blood and saliva test, which helps to assess the patient's response to the anti-clotting drug, PLAVIX. We have seen an increase in interests from physicians and patients in this important test. We continued to expand usage of our connectivity solutions. By the end of the first quarter Care360E prescribing users ordered at the rate of more than 16 million drugs a year, up about 30% from year end. We formally launched our Care360 EHR solution with less physician's ad hoc connectivity features like electronic ordering and prescribing at their own pace without incurring large capital cost or changing their office workflow. We are seeing a positive response. In addition, we're collaborating with Surescripts to make lab results and prescription history more accessible to physicians. During the quarter, healthcare reform legislation was passed. The new law will provide coverage for more Americans, especially children, and request coverage on prevention and wellness benefits without any cost sharing. Beginning in 2011, we will see a reduction in Medicare reimbursement. On balance, we believe health reform will be positive for our company and our industry over the long term. Our underlying business is strong. We are implementing plans to accelerate growth and further manage our costs. We are well-positioned for the future. Thank you. We will now take your questions, operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) First question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, your line is open
Ricky Goldwasser: Good morning.
Surya Mohapatra: Good morning, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: A couple of questions, first of all, in the volume trends, obviously, you were saying that you're seeing continued weakness in physician office visit. When do you expect we are going to start seeing stabilization of these volumes in 2010? And is it going to be on the second half or do you expect it to be more of a 2011 event? And then, second of all, on the cost cutting opportunities, can you quantify the run rate savings from the headcount reductions? And how much more cost cutting opportunities do you have?
Bob Hagemann: Okay. Ricky, first let me comment on the volumes. Yes, we said – yes, we did saw volume softness in the quarter. It was down to 2.6%. A point of that we just estimated to be weather. And yes, we have seen some general softness in the marketplace. We believe it's driven by physician office visits. It's also consistent with what you see in drug prescribing at this point as well. In terms of when that general softness will turn around, we're not expecting it to turn around any time in the near future. We expect that the market will continue to be soft for a little while. Although, yes, we think about our business we are expecting based upon the guidance that we put out there for revenue growth for our business to pick up over the remainder of the year. Essentially, if you looked at the guidance that we have out there now for revenue growth and you compare that to the 1% underlying revenue growth that we had in the first quarter, it would imply that it's going to accelerate certainly over the back half of the year. And there're several things for us to point to here. First, we're very excited about the opportunity for new tests to continue to grow. Surya mentioned vitamin D. We continue to see that growing strong. He mentioned the ImmunoCAP allergy testing. Both of those will contribute to our growth. And additionally, there're a number of new tests that we've either recently launched or planned for launch, which we see accelerating growth, whether it be the ColoVantage test, which is a receptor 9 biomarker; the test we have for Fragile X, which is XSense; OVA1; and of course, the active type test, which is the one for PLAVIX response. So those, in addition to the items that Surya mentioned in terms of us increasing our sales effectiveness, getting more sales reps in certain markets, and increasing the level of customer engagement, those are the things that we see accelerating our growth in the back half of this year, not necessarily a pick up in the underlying market.
Surya Mohapatra: Cost?
Bob Hagemann: And on the cost side, we're not going to provide specific cost savings associated with specific actions that we take. But what you should be comfortable with is the fact that this is a business because of the number of times, and you probably say this before, that we have to do rework either in reprocessing bills, recollecting samples because they were insufficient quantities, things like that, that there are – continue to be significant opportunities for us to improve the efficiency of our operations. And that program that we put in place several years ago is continuing. And they continue to be big opportunities for us. We're driving execution against those plans that we've had in place for a while, and feel very good about our ability to continue to manage the cost structure. And certainly, if we need to do more to adjust it to volume levels, we'll be doing that.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Tom Gallucci, your line is open. Please state your company name.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Lazard Capital Markets. Thank you, a follow-up on the volume, if I could, and then one other. I was just wondering if you're seeing anything unique in terms of geographic trends or payer mix trends on the weaker volumes.
Bob Hagemann: Yes, other than – Tom, other than the impact of weather, no. You have the general softness that we saw was pretty much across the board and no significant swings between pairs either.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. And then on – and then you talked to varying degrees over the last couple of years about your sales force related initiatives and maybe look into your take of market share over time. So could you give us an update there? And also maybe on the competitive landscape, we saw a blur recently about maybe you're all winning the Texas BlueCross BlueShield on an exclusive basis. So you see more deals out there that could be exclusive or can you give us an update on that environment?
Surya Mohapatra: Sure, Tom. This is Surya. Well first of all, we believe that we are maintaining our market share of 15%. This industry is highly fragmented, and there are ups and downs in the competitive – in the marketplace. But no, that's the way the business has been. But as you've heard from us that we see a general softness maybe related to the people visiting the doctor's office. For our esoteric business group, our esoteric laboratories grew stronger than our routine sales. And that's the reason why we have been diversifying our business. Now, 36% of our business is esoteric gene-based and anatomic pathology. So we will be investing more and more towards creating and introducing more gene-based testing, more esoteric testing for cancer, cardiovascular design, and (inaudible). So that's actually our value proposition. Now, as far as the minus [ph] care contract – and again, I mentioned that over the last quarters, few quarters, we have really extended most of our contracts. And that takes away the volatility of our – there is exclusive and unexclusive. We try to really work with the payers as they want. Some payers would like to really reduce their number and being exclusive. But the advantage is that once you have an open field, you can compete on the value proposition rather than the price. So we go back to our Six Sigma technology and Six Sigma quality, and esoteric testing. So at first, the health under concern, I'm very comfortable that we can see the top line visibility and performance. Now there's one other thing about – people talk about the competitors and what we are doing with sales effectiveness. There're always a couple of competitors in a couple of areas. They will do little bit different than what we do. But whenever the market slows, and this has happened in '03, and what we are doing is basically increasing our sales effectiveness and increasing our customer engagement, whether putting specific reps in the marketplace or upgrading our talent. We have no shortage of value propositions. So we need to be in the field, getting engaged with the customers, and call on our customers more often than the competitors. So that's what we are going to do.
Bob Hagemann: And Tom, I'll just add one thing. Surya said, yes, with respect to the payers, we respond to what they're looking for. The BlueCross, BlueShield Texas contract that you mentioned is really an exclusive, only one product in that marketplace. And it's not a trend that we see moving towards exclusive. In fact, we think open contracts are better for patients, for employers, for payers, and for providers at the end of the day. And that's what we hoped we'll see more of.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: When you say one product, you mean one of their health plan-type of products?
Bob Hagemann: Yes.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Shelley Gnall, your line's open. Please state your company name.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: Goldman Sachs. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if we could get a sense of, just broadly speaking, a way to characterize the types of tests that are seen the greatest weakness, obviously from the volume issue – I'm sorry, the weather-related issue. Try the ambulatory surgery centers for example, it's creating colonoscopies. They're the areas then I guess mostly – most deferred in the current recessionary environment. Is there just a broad way to characterize the type of testing other than just saying routines? Is there a way that we can think about what types of business has been the weakest? And for the flip-side, what is relatively the strongest?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, Shelley, first I would say weather doesn't differentiate. It impacts all of our business, whether it be routine or esoteric. But as we – as Surya said, in the quarter we saw a stronger growth in the esoteric business than in the routine business. And I would say the general market slowdown is probably impacting the routine business more than the esoteric business. But the weather is having nothing to do with mix.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if there's any way you could just broadly characterize – I mean, absent the weather effect, to just the general weakness we've seen. And it's a trend that we've been seeing for several quarters now throughout this recessionary environment. Is there a way to characterize the types of testing that are being most impacted?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, I think it's very difficult to characterize a particular type of test because we got 3,000 tests. But if you think about the disease process, there's a chronic disease and there's acute disease. And then, there's a cancer and cardiovascular disease, and infectious disease. I think what Bob and I were saying is that the esoteric business is growing because there are some tests which are very specific to a particular disease, which is important, basically, cancer diagnostics for cardiovascular disease. So that's the – not the – people are not giving up. But as far as the general softness, we have to be really careful because this industry – all the trends for this industry is positive. People are getting older. There're more tests. There're more technology coming in. So what we are seeing is probably a temporary softness in the marketplace. But having said that, when the softness comes, what we are doing actually, apart from managing costs, we would increase our competitiveness via self-effectiveness and customer engagement. When you are 15% market share, there's plenty of room to grow even though there might be softness in the marketplace.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: I guess the questions that I'm getting – thank you for that color. But what I'm wondering is if we start to see strengthening in the economy, and maybe it's not this year, maybe it's not even in 2011, at this point, you're taking cost reduction steps to manage the slower volume. If we start to see a rebound, how quickly can you scale back up? And how much – how much of a visibility will you have? And how will you get visibility or maybe strengthening demand for some of the tests that have some weakness – weakest?
Bob Hagemann: Shelley, with respect to the cost and our capacity, we're really not doing anything that's going to limit our capacity to take on additional volume. So we can scale up essentially at a moment's notice, dear. This is a very scaled business. And if you look at the impact of weather, you see that because there's a disproportionate impact on the bottom line when you see the revenues drop off because of weather. Because there's not a lot other than the direct variable costs that you could pull out in that short period of time. But again, in terms of visibility, we can respond very quickly to increases in volumes of just about any sort of test. So I don't see that as an issue for us in ramping up. And that will be a very good issue to deal with.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: Yes, fair enough. Thanks so much.
Operator: Adam Feinstein, your line's open. Please state your company name.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Yes, Barclays Capital, just – maybe just a follow-up. Pricing was pretty good in the quarter. And you talked about the favorable mix shift. But clearly, there was a small headwind from the Medicare pricing. So I just want to get some clarity there. And I know you said, Bob, there wasn't any big change in contracting, but I just want to get some clarity on pricing, and a quick follow-up after that.
Bob Hagemann: Adam, as I said, we continue to see mix shift and the number of tests ordered per requisition as the things that will continue to drive revenue per rec as we go forward. As Surya has said, we've got good visibility now into all of our major contracts, so there's clarity there. And we understand what the Medicare impact is going to be this year. We don't quite know exactly what it's going to be next year. But again, keep in mind that that's about 15% of our business. And we know what range we're talking about next year for Medicare. There'll be a CPI increase that will be offset by a productivity adjustment, which can't bring it down below zero. And then there's the 1.5% – 1.75% reduction, which is part of the healthcare reform package. So from a Medicare prospective, I think our greatest risk is a 1.75% reduction next year at about 15% or so of our business. But yes, I think we'll continue to see positive growth in revenue per acquisition, again, driven by the esoteric tests, the mix, and the number of tests ordered.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just a – maybe a quick follow-up question here. So again, clearly, the growth is doing much better in esoteric than in other core business. It's obvious this has been the case for a number of years such as the magnitude – certainly, to a greater magnitude now. So I guess, two questions, one, how do you think about acquisitions going forward so to the extent that you guys do stuff will be permanently focused on the esoteric side? And then two, how do you think about the competitive landscape because is there more than – more resources towards that – towards esoteric now, and once again, since there hasn't been any growth from the core market? So just how are you guys thinking about that?
Surya Mohapatra: Adam, we have – this is not a new strategy for us over the last four or five years. So we said that we're going to diversify more and more toward esoteric, gene, and anatomic pathology. And that's what we have done. And as I told you last quarter, you will see more and more investment in esoteric and gene-based testing. And how do you really combine molecular diagnostics with anatomic pathology? So when we look at competitive landscape, we are looking at the value proposition. How do we really combine this capability that we have of molecular diagnostics with anatomic pathology and using our connectivity to provide the costumer a unique value proposition that they don't have. Now, when you look at the acquisitions space, we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions. But as I said many times that we are not going to be anxious buyers. So we are looking at companies, which is going to help us to get more market share, whether it's cancer or cardiovascular disease. We're looking at companies, which is going to improve our science and innovation and lead us to that early stage of introducing new tests like we did with OVA1 and other stuff. So I'm very positive about how we utilize our cash to grow by investing in these higher end esoteric testing and gene-based testing.
Bob Hagemann: And Adam, that would include both laboratory testing as well as point-of-care testing.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay, great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Lester Thirks [ph], you're line's open. Please state your company name.
Lester Thirks – WellQuest: WellQuest [ph]. Do you hear me?
Bob Hagemann: Yes.
Kathleen Valentine: Can you state your name again, please.
Lester Thirks – WellQuest: Oh, I'm sorry, Lester from WellQuest. My question is basically this, how is the new passage of the healthcare bill going to affect Quests' revenues in relationship to Quests' strategic alignment with Google Health? That's question one. Question two is, is Quest going to continue with different online initiatives? And is there any interest in reviving? Because now the healthcare bill is passed, is there any interest in reviving the original initiative that it had in 2000 with this trademark named Quest Direct to open store fronts where people would proactively care for their health?
Surya Mohapatra: Well, first of all, the healthcare reform bill does include tests and preventive measures, and without cost lifting. So obviously, this is really helping people to do – take care of themselves. But as far as our relationship with Google Health and Microsoft, and Keas, we're very positive about these relationships because at the end of the day we need to really empower patients. They need to really work with the doctors. And they have to really take some accountability for their own disease. So we are working in a number of ways to help them to stay healthy and get healthy by working with some of these Web 2.0 companies. And at the same time, we have our own initiatives where we are helping patients to get their results, and our wellness initiatives, which a number of companies and a number of health plans use for the employer base. So we're pretty excited about it. Now as far as the store front and other things, you can still go to Google Health and buy a blueprint for wellness. And that's what the patient empowerment is all about.
Lester Thirks – WellQuest: Okay. Thank you very much.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: Kevin Ellich, your line's open. Please state your company name.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Thanks. It's Kevin Ellich from Royal Bank of Canada. I was wondering if you guys can talk about – provide a little bit more color on the drugs of abuse testing. It sounds like it's stabilized. And I'm just wondering if you think – what's really going on in that market? Is that the easy comps or are we starting to see some improvement?
Bob Hagemann: Kevin, as I indicated, that business has stabilized. It's a little too early to say that we're seeing a big uptick there, but the fact that it stabilized I think is good news.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And then it's good to see the esoteric mix at 36%. Have you guys ever provided the type of growth rate? I know it's growing faster than the core or routine test mix. But have you ever provided the growth rate or are you willing to do that now?
Kathleen Valentine: Kevin, this is Kathleen. We don’t provide the growth rate on our test product breakdown quarterly. We do provide it annually. And as we indicated today that we did see in Q1 that our gene-based and esoteric testing did grow faster than our overall and in our routine business, so we're pleased with that.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And are you seeing any pressure from hospital internalization. I think some segments like histology might be – or I guess that's in office internalization. Are you seeing pressure on that front?
Surya Mohapatra: We continue to see some internalization as the doctor said on the person for leading their own revenues. And we see the TCP, the technical component some of the people are doing. And that’s one of the concern we have. But again, this is, hopefully, temporary. As far as the hospital is concern, the way this business operates that there are separate tests when they become routine or become easy, some of the hospitals internalize it. But I’m happy to tell you that we are doing well with the hospitals because we're providing them with some value propositions, which are beyond just the test.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And then Surya, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the international markets. And I recently saw then that it looks like the Ireland psychology contract is no longer going to be exclusive. Is that business going to be split evenly? Or how is that going to work out for you guys?
Surya Mohapatra: Well first of all, we don’t know how it is going to split. But we did encourage getting another player there. Because first of all, we are there to stay and we are – we have done a very good job in providing services. (inaudible) have extended our contract for two more years. Now that will open the door for other businesses. But as far as how this is going to split and what is the charity of those things, we don’t have any information. But I will tell you that we have a good value proposition, working with the doctors and working with health authority. So I’m very encouraged that we could extend our contract for two more years.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And then, does that segue into a bigger contract in Ireland is going to be tendering?
Surya Mohapatra: You have read and we have read, obviously, that there is a bigger contract. And that's another reason why we are there. And hopefully, that will give us an opportunity to also sell the bigger contract. But this question about exclusive in a country, there's a positive side and negative side because first of all, there are no competitors. And second thing is actually how do you really train and educate people. So I encourage to have more than one player in some of these countries because it helps the industry and also it helps the healthcare providers. Now going back into international again, if you look at our strategy, as everybody knows, we said, "Look, the testing is moving to near patients." So that is why we invested in focused diagnostics too, and also enterics. And we'll more and more look at the platform where we can do testing near the patient that's applicable to the US and abroad. We have a modest investment in India. And we continue to do that because I think Indian market has the largest opportunity at the moment for us. And it takes – it does take a little bit of time, but I'm very positive. So when I look at our company in the next three, or four, or five years, in the short term, obviously, the esoteric, gene-based testing, and anatomic pathology going along with our routine businesses. But when you go to the mid-term, we're (inaudible), along with the point-of-care testing, cancer diagnostics in India, and (inaudible) healthcare ID.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay. And then lastly, I was wondering, are you willing to provide the pricing on the OVA1 test?
Surya Mohapatra: Do we have the pricing of the OVA1 test?
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Yes.
Kathleen Valentine: Our published list price, Kevin, is $650.
Kevin Ellich – Royal Bank of Canada: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: Darren Lehrich, your line is open. Please state your company name.
Seidi – Deutsche Bank: Hi, it's actually Seidi [ph] sitting in for Darren and I'm with Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to go back to workforce reductions. I guess the first question is, was that always part of the original $500 million cost reduction initiative or is this part of a new initiative?
Bob Hagemann: No, it’s not part of a new initiative at all. And it wasn’t part of the previous initiative. It was in response to the lower volume levels that we saw.
Seidi – Deutsche Bank: And could you comment at all in terms of where – in what part of the company those reductions were, or just what area just to get a sense for the size or the magnitude?
Bob Hagemann: It was broad-based in terms of administrative functions and functions that are directly affected by volume.
Seidi – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then on the revenue guidance, going down from 3% to 4%, the 1% to 2%, is there something – because you mentioned that weather impacted volumes by 1%, yet you're bringing down your revenue guidance by more than 1%. So how should I be thinking about that?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, as we said, the weather impact was only 1% in the quarter. We saw a general softness across the board that we’re expecting to continue. And that's the principal reason for bringing down the volume and revenue guidance – actually, the revenue guidance.
Seidi – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Ralph Giacobbe, your line's open. State your company name.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thanks, Credit Suisse, just a couple here. Bob, was there anything else that impact the volume in the quarter besides weather, any lost contracts, or anything that we need to be aware of? I know typically break that out and see – I just wanted to make sure that wasn’t the case. And then along those lines, can you maybe talk about the progression of volume through the quarter just given the softness. I know you typically don’t do that. But anything better in March because we did see a little bit of bounce back in some of the physician office visit data.
Bob Hagemann: Okay, well yes, let me repeat it again. There were no significant contracts or customer changes to point to in the quarter. And yes, we – you’re right. We typically don’t talk about how the business is performing within the quarter. But certainly, we looked at how we ended up, how we were doing as we entered the month of April as we established our guidance.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse:
 :
Surya Mohapatra: No, no. Well first of all, I think when we look at the market and we look at the area, and then we want to – the sales force is a bigger thing that we have to put to some reps in some marketplaces to penetrate more. We have to really upgrade some of these sales people to go towards the molecular diagnostics and the genetic testing, and also to launch the products appropriately. So it's just sales and marketing, along with the service we have. So it’s mainly outdoor-focused, getting onto the areas, and calling on people most.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Okay, and then just my last one. The margin expectation changed for trade outlook, 18.5% versus the 19%. Is that just the softer top line coming into play or is there something else?
Bob Hagemann: No, as I said, it's really the impact of the first quarter charge and the weather impact. Otherwise, margins were holding. And it’s really a function of us – two things, continuing to manage our costs. And yes, as you heard, we are seeing more of the softness on the routine side of the business. So the mix is continuing to improve and that helps margins of course.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: William Quirk, your line's open. Please state your company name.
William Quirk – Piper Jaffray: Piper Jaffray. Thanks. Good morning. Bob, appreciated the color on the physician (inaudible) trends. Any comment here in terms of the somewhat recent, call it, past three years or so trend towards physician specialties and sourcing the technical component of pathology, and you can add any color on that versus the (inaudible). That'd be great. Thanks.
Bob Hagemann: Surya already referenced that to some degree. But I would tell you that that's not the driver of the softness that we’ve seen. This softness is across the board. Yes, it's very consistent with what you're seeing in drug prescriptions and the like. So no, I wouldn't attribute it to in-sourcing.
William Quirk – Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great, and then, one big picture question and one housekeeping one. First off, Surya, we're starting to see what looks like it could be some fairly significant lab consolidation over in Europe in this – actually probably over the next three to five years. To what extent is there an opportunity for Quest here. And then just on the housekeeping side, about 38% tax rate, that’s the right number to use going forward? Thanks.
Surya Mohapatra: Well, with regards to lab consolidation, as you know, when we look at almost all the opportunities that’s ahead of us, and the moment we are focused in the United States and as far as international is concerned, you know we're in India and Ireland, if there is an opportunity country that makes sense, we'll – we will consider that. But there is no immediate plan for having any large international laboratory acquisition for the time being.
Bob Hagemann: And Bill, on the tax rate issue, we don't give specific guidance on that. But yes, I wouldn't expect it to be significantly different from what we saw on the first quarter.
Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray: Very good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Robert Willoughby, your line's open. Please state your company name.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Bob, can you give us some run rate for the other revenues, your non-lab testing businesses? That's been over the board and the variability. To that, as well as the other income and expense line item, has been somewhat confounding?
Bob Hagemann: Yes. In terms of the other pieces of our business that are outside of the clinical testing business, yes, they continue to be about 9% or so of our revenues. And as I said, yes, they do fluctuate a little more because they're more impacted by foreign exchange in a particular quarter. And certainly you should think about the point of care business. Yes, that's impacted by many of the same things, position office visits and the like, that our laboratory testing business is impacted by. So there is some general softness there as well. In terms of the other income expense line, yes, there's a couple of things in there, there's a – I believe it's detailed in the footnotes to the earnings release. There's a $4 million gain on an investment this quarter. But also in that line, I think we spoke about this at year end. Here are the gains and losses on the investment in the supplemental deferred comp plan. The important thing to remember about those is, to the degree that there is a gain or loss in that line, they're offset by a gain or loss that goes up in the operating income line and goes to compensation expense. So, those don't have an impact on the operating income percentage.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Bob Hagemann: And that creates some of the volatility in the quarters. For example, last year we had a loss on the assets and supplement deferred comp plan. This year we had a gain. But again you have the offsets, we're up above the line, no impact to operating income.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And I think you mentioned, Bob, the e-prescribing volume's up 30% or so. Did you mention EMR placements? I know it's early, but is there any metric you can give us going forward?
Bob Hagemann: At this point, there are over 1,000 users of the EMR product. That is not placements, but that's users.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And maybe, for certain I know you were recently at the White House. You were touting that you were actually hiring as a company and quite happy about that. And now we do see some cutting of the work force here. It's fairly quickly after that White House visit. Should I be worried a little bit more about your forecast and view of the future here? There seems to be an abrupt turn?
Surya Mohapatra: No, no, this is not really an abrupt turn. This is nothing unusual – you are used to these kinds of things. We have to do that all the time, whenever there is value up and down. But the positive trend is that we have still have a lot of jobs open. We're hiring people in science and technology and innovations. And we would hire people in sales. So we have to re-organize. We've got 42,000 people and we still have 600 vacancies. So I'm not really worried about whether we're going to hire people or not. We know this industry is competitive and whenever there's a little bit of softness we need to really adjust our cost accordingly, and that's basically what we are doing.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: How many people did the reductions touch?
Bob Hagemann: About 500.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Bob Hagemann: Thank you.
Operator: Anthony Vendetti, your line is open. State your company name.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Maxim Group. Can you talk about the plan for repurchasing, particularly here in the second quarter? And then, if you can just comment on whether or not you have been approached or by any suitors or what your – if you can comment on that, what are your acquisition plans are going forward?
Bob Hagemann: Okay. First, with respect to share repurchases, we don't give specific guidance on that. Yes, we tell folks that you should expect were going to deploy our cash first into growth opportunities with the degree that they're not available then into share repurchases. And to your second comment, we don't comment on rumors or speculations. We're focused on growing our base list.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Okay. But on acquisitions that you would make, is it – is this pretty much status quo what it's been going forward or any change to your acquisition plans?
Bob Hagemann: No, none at all. I mean Surya says earlier that, yes, we'd be looking at domestic acquisitions or regional esoteric, potentially with hospital laboratories. Point of care is an opportunity. But yes, we're also looking at investments that give us access to new testing methods and technology, so on the science and innovation side as well.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Kemp Dolliver, your line is open, state your company name.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Thank you. It's Avondale Partners. First question relates to molecular diagnostic testing and health plans. It looks like the plans are starting to pay more attention to billing for molecular diagnostics given the growth rate of the – of this area, and then also just their shortcomings in terms of billing. How are you working with your plans in contracting to have clear – provide adequate clarity on what the nature of the test packages that you're providing?
Bob Hagemann: Kemp, yes, first I would say is I'm not sure that we've seen any significant trend at all in terms of molecular diagnostics being reimbursed differently than any other testing that we do. And in fact, some of those molecular diagnostics are critically important. Yes, we talked about PLAVIX earlier. Well you can have diagnostics that help identify whether or not persons don't respond to a particular therapy. In cases like that, we're seeing significant interest on the part of health claims. So we have not seen any issues in terms of getting reimbursed for molecular diagnostics.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Okay. Great. The second question relates to all the commentary regarding the sales force effect (inaudible). And you gave a little bit of color with regard to the types of changes you're making. But could you just – is there a way you could give just a little more specifics with regard to what you're trying to do because when I – when I hear things such as upgrading people, et cetera, et cetera, after a while, it just becomes somewhat cliché. And understanding a little bit more about what exactly you – as a large organization, you think will change will be helpful. Thank you.
Surya Mohapatra: Okay. Well first of all, we have been building up a good sales organization. And we are, as you know, two years ago or two-and-a-half years ago, we went into very focused sales organization for putting on a customer base, whether it's the physician, whether it's a hospital, whether it's (inaudible) or anatomic pathology, so instead of the organization just was based regionally. And that all the (inaudible) on the regional organization, we went into focused organization with sales and marketing with various customers. Now, what we're doing is taking that organization, which is already strong, to build the next one because the – our business is changing more towards esoteric and anatomic pathology. And that's actually nothing new. But what we're doing now is to accelerate that plan. And the other additional thing when we say occurring challenge is actually making sure that we have the trained people. And then we are also going to add some of the reps in the marketplace, which we're not planning. But we're going to do that because of the softness in the market. And we'll work harder to maintain our market share. And we can all of us do better. So this is actually the next phase of going into the sales organization, which we've been building over the last two years.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Just quickly, the closed loop on that, pharma has been shedding jobs. Are some of these hiring people from, say, pharma to have expertise in particular areas such as on oncology–?
Surya Mohapatra: Right.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: –causing them and–?
Surya Mohapatra: You're absolutely right. There are good people available. And we have a lot of good people here, too. And we want to make sure that we have the right talent. And pharma have good people on (inaudible) concern. We're also adding some young people who are coming from other industries. The key is we need to have a very engaging self-organization, along with superior surveys. And what you are seeing now is a little bit of (inaudible) and because of the slowness in the marketplace.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Gary Taylor, your line's open. State your company name.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Hi, good morning, Citigroup. Just a few questions, one, on the severance charge, which I think grosses out to about $18 million. How much of that in cost of goods versus G&A, just for modeling?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, Gary, the way to think about that is the majority of it is in SG&A, unlike the weather impact where the majority of that was in cost of sales. And when you look at them combined, there's maybe slightly greater impact in SG&A, but they're pretty close. There's some discussion in the footnote in the earnings release.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Okay. I might have missed that. So that puts the SG&A number for the quarter in the low $270 million. Can you help us think about that dollar progression as you move through the year on G&A?
Bob Hagemann: Look, as we've told you repeatedly in the past, we don't think about managing it either as a cost of sales line or at the SG&A line. We're managing it at the operating income line. And yes, that's the result of – some of the decisions that we made drive costs in one line item, but save significant costs elsewhere. So that's the way we manage it. And that's also why we don't give guidance on either cost of sales or SG&A.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Okay. It looked like depreciation was down about $5 million sequentially. Could you talk about that and that run rate, I assume?
Bob Hagemann: Generally, it is – there're no adjustments in the depreciation line. I think if you'll look at our capital spending over the last couple of years, a few years back, we had some pretty heavy investments, which we have anniversaried at this point, so. Yes, I think you can assume that we're at a pretty good run rate in there. Although, I would tell you, in order to hit the CapEx guidance that we have for the full year, you'll see some increased capital spending later in the year and some increased depreciation attached to that.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: And then finally, I think Tom asked this and I just missed the answer, but just going back to the drug of abuse testing, which was a big drag through most of last year becoming less of a drag and no mention in the release today. Are we assuming, just year-over-year, no impact on overall volume?
Bob Hagemann: Well I did mention it in my prepared remarks that there is no impact on the year-over-year revenue volume at this point.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Okay. Great. Thanks.

Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Conference Call. Now, I would like to introduce, Kathleen Valentine, Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics.
Kathleen Valentine: I am here with Surya Mohapatra our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hagemann our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements which speak only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations, or beliefs, and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include but are not limited to adverse results from pending or future government investigation, lawsuits or private actions, the competitive environment, changes in government regulations, changing relationships with customers, payers, suppliers, and strategic partners, and other factors described in the Quest Diagnostics 2008 Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra. 
Surya Mohapatra: We drove solid earnings growth in the fourth quarter, earnings per share grew 11%, and revenues increased 2.7% to $1.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $360 million. This completed a year of strong performance despite the challenging economic environment. For the full year we grew earnings per share 20% to $3.88, revenues increased 2.8% to $7.5 billion. Cash from operations was $1 billion. We have been expanding our pipeline of new tests and services that will improve patient care, reduce overall healthcare costs, and drive growth for our company. At the same time, we are continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations and quality of our service. For 2010 we expect continued strong performance, revenues to grow between 3% and 4% and earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30. Additionally, this morning we announced that our Board of Directors has approved $750 million for future share buybacks, demonstrating confidence in our performance and commitment to increasing shareholder value. Now here is Bob to discuss our financial performance.
Bob Hagemann: As you heard, our business is strong, performing well, and has a bright future. Despite continued challenging economic conditions we have again grown revenues and earnings and produced outstanding cash flow in 2009, and we remain confident in our prospects for continued growth in 2010. Turning to results for the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.97, 11% above the prior year with the increase principally driven by strong operating performance. This brings full year EPS to $3.88 an increase of 20%. In the quarter we recorded a charge of $0.04 per share associated with prepaying certain of our near term debt maturities. This $0.04 was fully offset by the favorable impact of certain non-recurring tax benefits which increased EPS by $0.04. Revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, 2.7% above the prior year. Our clinical testing business, which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues grew 2.3% in the quarter and about 3% before the impact of our pre-employment drug testing business. Reported volume was slightly below the prior year level. The decline in pre-employment drug testing continued to be a drag on volumes but to less of an extent then it had been. Drug testing volumes were off about 14% in the quarter compared to last year and reduced consolidated volume by 0.8%. As we enter the first quarter of 2010 we expect the impact on volumes of drug testing to anniversary. After considering drug testing volume, underlying volume grew about 0.5%, about half a point lower then the third quarter. The decrease is principally due to a general softness in the quarter and not any particular contract or customer changes. Revenue per requisition increased 2.6% with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix and a benefit of just over 0.5% from the Medicare fee increase which went into effect at the beginning of the year. The fourth quarter percentage increase was less then we reported through the first three quarters, principally due to the very strong revenue per requisition we saw in the fourth quarter last year which impacts the comps for the quarter. The absolute level of revenue per requisition in the quarter reflects sequential improvement from the third quarter. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses which includes our risk assessment business, clinical trials testing business, point of care testing business, and MedPlus and contain most of our international revenues grew 7% in the quarter. A table contained in footnote seven to the earnings release summarizes the impact of various revenue metrics associated with a number of the items I just discussed. For the fourth quarter, operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.9% up from 17.6% last year. For the full year, the operating income percentage improved to 18.2% compared to 16.9% in 2008. These improvements are due to revenue growth and the progress we have made with our cost reduction program. That program has been very successful and has now delivered over $500 million in annualized cost reductions since its inception in 2007. While we no longer plan to provide cost reduction targets, that program supplemented with new initiatives, will continue to drive further efficiencies in our operations and be an important contributor to our continued margin expansion in 2010 and the years to come. We continued to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.9% in the quarter and brought the full year percentage to 4.3%. DSOs at 43 days were consistent with the Q3 level and improved a day from a year ago. Our cash flow continued to be outstanding. Cash from operations for the quarter was $360 million in line with a very strong performance in last year’s fourth quarter. This brings the full year total to $1 billion even after considering the $350 million settlement payment made earlier in the year. During the quarter we fully utilized our remaining share repurchase authorization and repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average price of $58.49 for a total of $150 million. Capital expenditures were $50 million in the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $534 million at quarter end. The buildup in cash in the quarter is due to the very successful $750 million notes offering we completed in November, $600 million of the proceeds was used to repay debt maturing through 2011 with the remainder now part of our available cash balance. Our cash balance, coupled with our unused credit lines provides us with significant liquidity and positions us extremely well capitalized on growth opportunities and take other actions like share repurchases to drive shareholder value. Consistent with that objective, and in order to provide us with multiple options and continued flexibility to deploy excess cash, our Board has authorized an additional $750 million of share repurchases. There is no specific timeframe over which the additional share repurchase authority will be utilized. Given our current credit profile, we do not anticipate further debt reduction in 2010. Our first priority for us of our cash continues to be growth and other actions to enhance shareholder returns. We have consistently delivered strong performance under highly variable economic conditions. During 2009 we continued to grow our business, generate substantial cash, and grew our earnings per share by 20%. This was accomplished as we made further investments in our business and took other actions which positioned us for continued growth and strong performance. In addition, it was a year in which we met or exceeded all of our financial commitments made at the outset; those for revenue growth, margin expansion, cash flow, and EPS. Now, as we look ahead to 2010 we expect continued progress. For 2010 we expect the following from continuing operations. Revenue growth of between 3% and 4%, operating income as a percentage of revenues to approach 19%, cash from operations to approximate $1.3 billion, capital expenditures to approximate $200 million, and lastly diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30 excluding any potential special charges. Now I’ll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: We continued to execute our plan and drive growth. I will discuss the drivers of growth in the quarter and also the investments we continued to make for the future. Fourth quarter profitability was driven by top line growth and ongoing improvements in quality and efficiencies. In 2009 we achieved our goal of $500 million in annual savings related to our cost cutting program launched in 2007. We will continue to drive further operating efficiencies in 2010. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by continued strong demand for gene-based and esoteric testing including cancer diagnostics. Revenues from this test continued to grow faster then overall revenues. Gene-based, Esoteric and Anatomic Pathology testing now account for approximately 36% of all revenues. Here are some highlights of fast growing tests from the quarter. Vitamin D testing using tandem mass spec grew more than 50%, allergy testing using ImmunoCap grew more than 10%, and our Leumeta family of leukemia and lymphoma tests grew more than 40%. Our continued focus on innovation is driving growth today and preparing us for the future. We are expanding our test offerings to cover the full spectrum of diagnostic needs from screening to diagnosis to treatment and monitoring. On the cancer front we are integrating our expertise in clinical pathology, anatomic pathology, and molecular diagnostics to help physicians take better care of patients. We are excited to introduce OVA1 later this quarter. OVA1 is the first blood test cleared by the FDA that can help a physician evaluate the risk that an ovarian mass is malignant or not so the patient can be directed to the most appropriate surgeon. Last year we launched HE4 testing to monitor ovarian cancer recurrence. With OVA1 and HE4 in our portfolio we are now the only diagnostic testing company to offer FDA cleared tests for ovarian cancer in the pre and post surgical settings. Another example of innovation is what we are doing in infectious disease. Last year we rapidly developed and deployed our H1N1 test and test kit to expand the nation’s capacity to perform quality testing for the H1N1 virus. This is a great example of how we are able to respond quickly to a public health need, help patients and drive growth. We made significant strides in the area of healthcare IT which helps drive clinical testing growth. During 2009 subscription to our e-prescribing solution more than doubled. As we exited the year physicians were ordering prescriptions at a rate of more than 12 million drugs a year, nearly triple the rate at the end of 2008. Our recently launched Care360 electronic health record will help physicians improve patient care and office efficiency without changing their office workflow. We have also continued to innovate in service delivery as a way to differentiate ourselves from the competition. We introduced a number of service announcements during 2009 such as our specimen tracking capability. Innovation has also helped us drive improvements in efficiency throughout our operation. We achieved our target for reducing our cost structure by $500 million and continue to identify opportunities to drive efficiency and enhanced quality. Finally, we generated $1 billion in cash from operations. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility to capitalize on growth opportunities. In closing, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and full year. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and drive efficiency in our business. We are the leader in a growing and vital industry and are positioned for continued growth in 2010 and beyond.  We’ll now take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: The cash flow guidance, if you adjust for the payment that you had this past year it’s relatively flat. Why wouldn’t we see a bit more cash flow in 2010?
Bob Hagemann: You’re right. It is pretty consistent with this year’s cash flow but think about our cash flow as principally earnings driven. We’re anticipating that DSOs are going to be generally stable and in 2009 we really had the benefit of reducing DSOs and driving down some other working capital areas. We think that’s less of an opportunity in 2010 although we’re going to continue to try and drive that as well.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: The revenue relative to our expectations upside came from some of the non-clinical areas. Can you give us a couple highlights what happened on that side of the business that drove some upside? Lastly, your plans for the EMR this quarter?
Bob Hagemann: Those other businesses in total which are about 9% of our total revenues grew about 7% in the quarter. The clinical trials testing business grew, we had growth in point of care as well. I wouldn’t say there was anything out of the ordinary there.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Your electronic medical record that’s due out this quarter?
Bob Hagemann: That was not a contributor to growth in the fourth quarter. While we’re expecting it to be an attractive offering to physicians we’re also not expecting that though to be a big driver of revenue growth in the upcoming year. As you know, we’ve always thought about EHR and e-prescribing as something that helps us imbed ourselves into the workflow in the office and make the relationship with those physicians and hospitals even stickier.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Can you break out the number of docs that are actually using the e-prescribing solution and perhaps tell us going forward how many have adopted that electronic health record?
Bob Hagemann: The number of users is in the thousands at this point for the e-prescribe. We’re just ramping up with the EHR it’s certainly a smaller number at this point. That’s more than doubled since we’ve launched it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: In terms of the share repurchases you indicated another $750 million. Is that going to be spread evenly and is that built into the $4.10 to $4.30 guidance at this point?
Bob Hagemann: At this point we’re not going to speculate as to when or how much of the share repurchase program that we would execute in 2010. You should expect that we’re going to put our cash to use. Whether its growth which is our first priority or share repurchases which would be the alternative, we’re going to deploy the excess cash that we generate in 2010.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: Can you talk about the types of acquisitions you’ll be looking at in 2010, is it going to be more on the gene-based and esoteric side or are you looking to just continue to expand your reach?
Bob Hagemann: We’re really not looking to change our priorities at all related to growth. We’ll continue looking for opportunities which leverage our core competency and diagnostic testing whether that is domestic acquisitions or regional esoteric or hospital laboratories. We’ll look for opportunities to expand our point of care operations and then obviously investments which will give us access to new testing methods and technologies or licenses investments or acquisitions.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group: On the guidance, is that figuring that the economy stays relatively flat or does that expect an up tick in the economy?
Bob Hagemann: We expect that the economy had some impact on our results in ’09. We expect it will probably continue to impact us in 2010 but we’re not expecting the economic climate in 2010 to be all that different then 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Sidib Singh] – Deutsche Bank
[Sidib Singh] – Deutsche Bank: If you could talk in general about the digital pathology initiative and how you think that’s impacting your business to date.
Surya Mohapatra: The cost of our digital pathology is in early state but we expect that this is going to be a very important aspect of combining clinical pathology, anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics. Not only you could look at those images you can manipulate those images but also we can take care and take images off some of our specialists who may have been remote places.  One example that we are using digital pathology is in Ireland, we get that data and then they look at the data from here over digital pathology. We are expecting to have digital pathology as a hub for integrating all the results and that’s one of the reasons why we acquired AmeriPath to combine anatomic pathology with molecular diagnostics and have digital pathology as the base. 
[Sidib Singh] – Deutsche Bank: If you could follow up and discuss Septin 9 launch and share your thoughts with us on how you think this test will be used and adopted and any sort of update on the managed care strategy as it relates to that test.
Kathleen Valentine: Septin 9 which we’ve named ColoVantage that’s our new molecular based test. It’s based on the Septin 9 biomarker and it can aid in the detection of colorectal cancer. We are offering the test currently; we will be launching the test sometime shortly after Epigenomics releases its pre-sep study which we are participating in. We expect those results to be available sometime later this year. Its still early days from a launch perspective obviously, we will be working on our reimbursement strategy and specifically related to that, establishing appropriate coverage from the health plans and the government payers.
Surya Mohapatra: One of the things we used a few years ago and actually invested money to diversify our business for more to our gene-based and esoteric and anatomic pathology. I’m very, very proud of the fact that 36% of our business is how on high growth, high margin business. You will see more and more introductions of products with gene and esoteric whether it is for colorectal cancer or for ovarian cancer. We are going to work with the health plans to establish the reimbursement but more importantly to give a choice to the patient to have alternative tests which are more specific and more sensitive.
[Sidib Singh] – Deutsche Bank: I noticed sequentially the margins were down slightly and wanted to get your thoughts on whether there was any sort of new trend that you’re seeing with expenses that would suggest that maybe margin are closer to 18% rather than 19% in 2010.
Bob Hagemann: You should look historically at our margin; it varies from quarter to quarter. The second and third tend to be the quarters with the strongest margin percentage then the first and the fourth tend to be the lowest. I think you’re just seeing the normal seasonality and behavior in our business there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley
Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley: On the bad debt expense, is this 3.9% level sustainable in 2010? Around hospital and reference labs it seemed that the results for 2009 were somewhat slower then historically, is this mainly the impact of the economy or you’ve seen some increased competition in the market space? If you can discuss the potential type of acquisitions that you’re looking at, we saw some reports from local newspapers in India that you were looking at potential acquisitions there. I know there was some speculation in the marketplace that you might look at companies on the product continuance. If you can update us on what’s you’re current thinking there.
Bob Hagemann: The bad debt percentage of 3.9% in the fourth quarter, don’t think of that necessarily as our new run rate for bad debt. Bad debt in any one quarter has probably 10 to 20 basis points of what I’ll call normal variability in it. Additionally, in this fourth quarter we had some very strong cash collection this year and made some concerted effort to collect some older receivables and as a result it brought the bad debt rate down a little bit in the quarter. Going forward I wouldn’t expect the bad debt rate to be significantly different then the full year rate that we had this year. I think the next question was related to hospital reference labs and whether or not there was a slowing there. There’s really nothing unusual there. One of the things that you need to keep in mind is, we have it broken out in footnote seven, that the lab management contracts that we exited a year ago are now anniversarying but they impacted the full year results somewhat, particularly on the volume side. There’s nothing in particular, I don’t see the economy impacting hospital reference work any different then the rest of our volumes at this point. Lastly, India, first of all with respect to specific discussions about an acquisition we’re not going to speculate on that, we don’t comment on rumors and speculation. We do have no plans for any international acquisitions at this point.
Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley: In terms of your share buyback program, what you’re factoring into the budget for 2010 is that exclusive of the potential acquisitions?
Bob Hagemann: As you know, the guidance for earnings that we put out each year is an all in number. It would include the impact of any acquisitions that we might do or any share repurchases that we might do. You’ve heard us say this before that our first priority for deploying cash is into growth and if growth opportunities aren’t available or they’re not available at the right price we’ll deploy excess cash into share repurchases at that point.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: Looking at your comments around 2010 and margins you talk about the operating margin potentially approaching 19%. Not to get too literal with you but if your operating margin were to get close to 19% that performance in terms of the percentage of increase would be pretty close to 2009 which given your prior comments about the cost reduction program is actually pretty impressive. Could you speak to any changes in priorities in the cost reduction side for 2010 versus where they’ve been the last three years?
Bob Hagemann: Overall don’t think of it as any dramatic changes. The program that we have in place will continue and we’ll continue focusing on the areas where we think the biggest opportunity to improve our efficiency lie. That’s going to continue to be standardizing our operations, deploying best practices across everything, using lean six sigma principles both within our laboratories and outside our laboratories, working on procurement and supply chain, obviously billing collection will continue to work on and we see opportunities there, rationalizing our real estate costs and certainly increasing electronic ordering, those are all areas that we’ll focus on but they’re just some of the areas.  We will continue to touch really all aspects of our business with this program. As I think about it, hopefully we’ll start to think about it here internally less as a program and really more as a way of doing business.
Kemp Dolliver – Avondale Partners: What are your observations regarding the labor market for particularly the more specialized lab technician functions?
Surya Mohapatra: The reality is that we need more medical technologists, we need more histotechnologists and there are not a lot of places where they’ve been trained. We are internally training; we are working with some of the universities. This is one of the comments that I made that we need to invest in people and as we grow the company it is certainly starting up these technologies and we are training internally but there is no immediate panic, just a question of what is going to happen in five years and seven years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor – Citigroup
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: I wanted to go back to pricing in the quarter and make sure I understood a comment that Surya made early in the call. Looking at revenue per requisition on average typically the dollar amount is down in 4Q which I think is a seasonal phenomenon presumably mix. It does look like that was down about $3.00 sequentially this year versus $2.00 last year. I think a comment was made that the absolute pricing was up sequentially.
Bob Hagemann: I’m not sure how you’re doing your math but revenue per requisition is up versus the prior year and its up from the third quarter. If there’s some confusion we can catch you offline to go through your numbers.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: It sounds like there’s definitely confusion but I’ll see if I can straighten myself out. Secondly, on the cost side there’s not an explicit dollar amount on the cost savings for ’10 unlike what you had prior years is that correct?
Bob Hagemann: That’s correct. As we told you, when we first launched this program we had some very specific targets which we wanted to lay out there for people. At this point, this program is really becoming more and more of a way of doing business. It’ll continue driving improvements in margin for us, that coupled with top line growth. No, it doesn’t make sense for us to put a target out there every year for you. Think of it as built into our operating income target.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Other operating expense was a $5 million number its typically pretty de minimis even $5 million isn’t a lot for you but is that a unique thing?
Bob Hagemann: If you’re taking other operating that includes an almost $4 million of foreign exchange in the quarter. If you look, a lot of this is detailed in the footnotes to the earnings release.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Overall in terms of volume growth we’ve been looking at the overall requisition growth and looking at that ex the drag from the drug of abuse testing and the year started pretty weak and got sequentially stronger 2Q, 3Q and now looks to have backed off a little bit in 4Q. I understand 3Q was probably inflated a little bit because you were comping a quarter with some hurricane impact in it. When you just think about routine testing growth in the fourth quarter versus what you’ve seen the last couple quarters, any particular observations to make?
Bob Hagemann: As I said, there was some general slowdown in the fourth quarter. One of the things that I think is important is not to read too much into any particular quarter. As we look at where the fourth quarter came out versus the way we’re thinking about our guidance we’re in about the same place as we were last year. You may recall that last year’s revenue growth in the fourth quarter was a little bit below the expectations that we set for the year. We’re in the same position this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: I know we’ve talked a lot about the 2010 guidance, I was wondering does it include acquisitions and also given the operating margin is expected to approach 19% and therefore there would be some margin expansion, how much of that is dependent upon volume growth or volume coming back?
Bob Hagemann: With respect to the revenue guidance there are no acquisitions in there, that is organic revenue growth. The earnings per share number though assumes that we’ll deploy our cash either into acquisitions or into share repurchases. Think of that as an all in number. The later part of your question?
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: Margin expansion with operating margin to approach 19% how much of that is dependent on volume growth or volumes picking up?
Bob Hagemann: Certainly in order for us to continue expanding margins we need both top line growth and we need to continue making progress on our cost reduction programs. You should assume that it does anticipate continued revenue growth and as we think about the revenue guidance, although we’re not giving guidance for the components of price and volume, we are expecting both of them to grow in 2010.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: Thinking about your relationships with some of the small diagnostic testing companies like Vermillion and the launch of OVA1 actually could you give us some color and detail behind what’s going with OVA1 launch when its expected? What other diagnostic testing categories you’re interested in or looking at?
Surya Mohapatra: Let me first start with the diagnostic category, we are focusing on pre-diagnostic areas infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer diagnostics. One of the major reasons for acquisition of AmeriPath that we want to be the destination for cancer patients when it comes to cancer diagnostics so that’s going on as well as far as integration is concerned. Now we are working with other companies whether it is Vermillion or whether it is other companies where we are bringing in new gene-based testing. Some of these companies were for years and we are very excited that Vermillion is come up with OVA1 and we’re going to introduce it this quarter. As far as going forward you heard the same thing about Epigenomics as far as ColoVantage, colorectal cancer you will see us more and more doing gene-based and esoteric testing whether it’s for personalized medicine or whether it is just medicine to improve specificity and sensitivity almost all aspects of cancer.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: Going back to the international, could you give us an update on India, how is it performing? What other opportunities are you guys looking at in the international markets this year?
Surya Mohapatra: I just came back from India 10 days ago and that country is growing. While the Western countries are growing 2% to 3% this country is growing 7% to 8% and the Prime Minister announced that the country is growing to 10% in the future. As we said, that one of our original goals what was that we are going to have 10% of our total revenue international business. India is a very important area for us and we have started getting customers, the laboratory is working and it will take some time but we are very excited about our position in India and we are making an impact there. As far as the international growth, as Bob said, there is no immediate plan to acquire any company but we want to be very successful in India. We’re always looking for opportunities and we don’t want to speculate on those. We are working in India, we have done a good thing in Ireland as far as cyto is concerned and then we have operation in Mexico and the UK.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: That cytology contract in Ireland does that come due this year?
Bob Hagemann: It does and we’ll be re-bidding on that obviously.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: With your Care360 EHR and the meaningful use definition that was released at the end of 2009 have you guys gone through and does your system meet those requirements now?
Bob Hagemann: At this point it does not but our next release coming out later this year will and it’ll come out well ahead of when the incentives for that kick in.
Kathleen Valentine: We’re very comfortable that our solution will meet all the criteria established by the meaningful use.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: On pricing I was wondering if you could back out the Medicare rate component in the revenue per requisition for the fourth quarter.
Bob Hagemann: As I told you that’s been about 0.5% throughout the year.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: On the drugs of abuse testing I want to confirm, it sounds like it’s not expected to be a drag in 2010. Is that a change in view or is that consistent with your expectations for the last couple quarters?
Bob Hagemann: It’s really not a change in view, as we said for some time now; we expect that the impact of that business will anniversary in the first part of 2010. While we don’t expect it to be a big drag on our volumes or our revenue growth year over year, we’re also not expecting it be a big contributor either.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs: Can you remind us historically in your EPS guidance range, has that historically been provided the same way? In other words, the revenue is organic, the EPS would include any share repurchases done or any acquisition impact for the year?
Bob Hagemann: Yes, very consistent with what we’ve done historically.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: You noted the moderating volume trends or the sluggishness that’s out there. What are your views, your growth versus the overall market growth? Do you have any thoughts as to maybe why it’s been a little slower lately?
Bob Hagemann: It’s certainly hard to pinpoint it. We think that in general we’re probably growing consistent with what the market is doing. The general softness that we saw in the quarter we expect that it’s probably consistent with trends in physician office visits and drug prescriptions which were written.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Its sort of small but if you could remind us the impact of the physician cuts that could come out there depending on what happens in Washington and how you’ve handled that in your guidance?
Kathleen Valentine: For 2010 we have included in our guidance is about $25 million in cuts from CMS and that’s the 1.9% reduction on the clinical fee schedule and then the RVU adjustments that are in place on the physician fee schedule.
Bob Hagemann: The sustainable growth rate that they’ve talked about there’s nothing specific in there for that at this point. Any action on it has been put off until I believe its March 1st of this year. At this point we’re expecting that Congress will ultimately act to do something with that so we’re not making specific built into our guidance for it.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: You mentioned pathology along with gene-based and esoteric as important areas. We’ve been seeing and hearing for a long time about a shift toward more in house operations. Can you give us an update on what your thoughts are on the pathology landscape generally?
Surya Mohapatra: As you know, over the last five or six years, every year very disciplined way we are growing, now we have 800 MDs in the company. We have a number of specialists whether it is pathology or it is humanopathology. Once you build this what I call the brain power, our doctors are seeing more patients a day then some of the hospitals. One of the questions I ask the companies, who is looking at your slides? This is our really great, great strength and we want to really leverage.  Another way of leveraging is really to combining clinical pathology and anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics and you’re seeing some of these results and obviously people talk about personalized medicine, that’s what we’re doing. Once we combine with the digital pathology we think this is going to really give us a really unique advantage to really move forward. We see some in-sourcing in the hospitals and people are trying to do what I call the individual analysis that where you see some decrease in the anatomic pathology in the tissue. I don’t think it’s a long term trend because people are going to really come to us for more then just the tissue.
Bob Hagemann: You’ll see out on our website that the anatomic pathology business for the year was essentially flat year over year and I think a lot of that slowdown had to do with the in-sourcing. The anatomic pathology is just a piece of the broader market for cancer diagnostics and given the molecular test that we offer which are often getting ordered now in conjunction with tissue and other AP work, we feel as though we’re very, very well positioned for the long term, particularly with the 800 pathologists that we’ve got on board to offer consultations. When you think about the broader market for cancer diagnostics we think that we’re positioned extremely well there in spite of this trend of in-sourcing which at some point given that its again a play for broader cancer diagnostics I’m not sure that that’s going to have the same impact that its had historically.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: On the pricing side things still look very healthy there but we can see some slowdown in other growth. I know annual mix will play into that but just curious to get some more clarity in terms of the revenue per req on the quarter?
Bob Hagemann: As I said earlier, revenue per req in the quarter actually continued to improve from the third quarter level and it’s improve sequentially every quarter this year. The reason that the percentage increase from last year’s fourth quarter is down compared to the year over year increases we saw earlier in the year was principally because of a very strong revenue per req in the fourth quarter last year. We had some big recoupments and some big reimbursement initiatives go on that really helped that fourth quarter revenue per req last year. As we look ahead we don’t expect pure pricing to be a driver of improvements in revenue per requisition, it hasn’t been historically and we’re not expecting that to be going forward, particularly with the fact that in 2010 we’ll have the Medicare fee decrease versus an increase in 2009. It will continue to be the number of test orders per requisition and test mix that drive improvements in revenue per req as we go forward.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: On the acquisition side, you’ve talked a little bit about that being a priority, just curious whether you believe that multiples are getting better? This time last year things were pretty bad out there but sellers were still looking for big multiples. You guys sat on the sidelines for most of 2009. Curious whether in your conversations are you seeing more reasonable multiples for some of these transactions?
Bob Hagemann: Certainly more reasonable then we saw several years ago. I think there’s probably a little more rationale which has been brought to it but each transaction is a separate transaction you need to get a buyer and seller to come to an agreement.
Surya Mohapatra: We are in a very good position and I am really very proud of the work we do and we’re collecting cash. We are not going to be anxious buyers.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: You said before you made your cost cutting goal and now as part of business going forward. You made similar comments in the past. As you think about margins and longer term margin trends, I’m not looking for a point on number but I’m just saying is there still more efficiency and if so what areas in one area you still there is longer term opportunity as you think about your cost structure?
Bob Hagemann: Our goal to get to 20% operating income as a percentage of revenues is unchanged. If we get there and we think we can go further we’ll give you some insight at that point. Right now our goal is to get there over time. As I think about our business and I think about the opportunities here keep in mind that we keep talking about the lab a lot, only 35% or so of our costs are within the four walls of the laboratory. There are a lot of costs outside whether it is logistics, whether it is patient service centers, in getting those specimens to the laboratory. Those are areas that we’ll continue to look at in addition to the laboratory. The billing, I continue to talk about billing and bad debt. That’s an opportunity for us. It will continue to be going forward. The more and more that we can do with our customers electronically the more and more that it reduces manual effort, it reduces errors and then driving six sigma quality which is all about doing it right the first time and eliminating rework. There’s a tremendous amount of rework that’s still done in this industry in our business and to the degree that we can eliminate that we’ll improve quality and we’ll continue driving down costs and that’s our goal.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: In terms of the volumes, obviously you talked about general softness in the quarter, some of that attributed to just a slowdown in physician office visits as well as scripts. Given that, how comfortable are you that you mentioned that you expect volume growth, what would give you that comfort level that you will see it just given some of the recent trends we’ve seen?
Bob Hagemann: We’re not looking at just any one quarter as we think about this. If you look a the full year and you look at the footnote seven that’s in the press release you’ll see that there was about 1.5% impact of various items that we do not expect to recur in 2010. When you adjust for that, the guidance that we put out there is very consistent with 2009 performance. As I said, last year in the fourth quarter the revenue growth was slower then we have projected for the full year yet we came in right on those numbers that we projected for the full year. I know people look at every quarter but it’s important not to read too much into any one quarter because things can vary. 
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: In terms of the pricing mix, up 2.6% this quarter, given that we’re going to see some tough comps as we head into next year and given the Medicare rate cut, it is essentially fair to take the run rate from 4Q minus the Medicare cut as sort of a starting point to think about revenue per requisition for next year?
Bob Hagemann: I said earlier, we don’t give guidance for the components of revenue growth but as you pointed out, in 2009 we had a tailwind of a Medicare fee increase and in 2010 we have the headwind of a decrease. That’s certainly something to factor in as you’re trying to make your estimates as what you think revenue per req might be. We’re not going to get into the business of providing the components because as we’ve told you in the past, sometimes we’ll take action to make sure that the business is profitable and that means oftentimes walking away from volume but it improves overall profitability. We’re driving for profitable revenue growth and not necessarily focused on one or the other metric right now.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Given the new share repo authorization does that speak at all to what you’re seeing or what you’re not seeing on the acquisition front?
Bob Hagemann: Not at all. If you think about what we’ve done historically this is usually the time of year that we re-up our share repurchase authorization, we’ve exhausted it in the fourth quarter. We now have flexibility to move forward with additional share repurchases. It’s not supposed to signal anything with respect to opportunities to grow the business.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Could you remind us either percentage of your costs to percentage of revenue is patient service centers?
Bob Hagemann: We have not provided that guidance but as I’ve told you, 65% of our costs are outside the four walls of the laboratory, patient service centers being one of those costs. They’ve got 2,000 patient service centers roughly around the country; you’ve got roughly 8,000 pathologists so that’s obviously a big chunk of our costs.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Claire – Piper Jaffray
David Claire – Piper Jaffray: Another question on volume in the quarter, what was the growth rate for your esoteric testing volume? Can you give us any color on some of the more established esoteric tests like HPV and Chlamydia and gonorrhea in the quarter?
Kathleen Valentine: We don’t give any test specific information. What I can tell you is our gene-based and esoteric testing as we said earlier it did grow faster then our overall rate. I’d point you to our website; we’ve got some supplemental financial schedules that give you a nice breakdown by product category of our revenue performance in the year.
Bob Hagemann: You’ll see there that the gene-based and esoteric grew at about two times the rate that routine grew in the year.
David Claire – Piper Jaffray: A recent filing that you guys put out you mentioned a potential acquisition of a diagnostic testing business. Can you give us an update here?
Bob Hagemann: There’s really nothing to update. As I’ve explained this to several people already, anytime you do a debt offering and you discuss use of proceeds the disclosure requirements are very, very specific there. Given that we’re always talking about potential acquisition opportunities we were obligated to make some disclosures that there could be something.  When you look at that disclosure, the way it’s written, it basically says that there’s the potential for us to do an acquisition anywhere from several million dollars to $250 million. In any case it would have been an immaterial acquisition, obviously nothing has closed here, there’s nothing to announce. Quite frankly, given the size of it, it’s not necessarily something that we would press release if we had completed it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Amanda Murphy – William Blair
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: Based on the discussion it sounds like if you take out drugs of abuse and seasonality that perhaps the underlying utilization trends have gotten a little bit worse, is that a fair statement? If so, as you’re out if the field is there something specific that you’re hearing that’s driving that?
Bob Hagemann: In the prepared remarks I did indicate that the underlying volume growth slowed about half a point from that we saw last quarter. Again, if you look at footnote four and you compare that to the previous quarters you’ll be able to do all the math. No, there’s no one particular thing that we’re pointing to in terms of a slowdown, we think it was the general softness. As I said, I think it’s very consistent with the trends or expected to be consistent with the trend for physician office visits and the number of drug prescriptions written.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: In terms of the cost savings, PUC mentioned that specifically some new initiatives for 2010. We’ve talked a lot about it, I don’t know if you’ve already mentioned them specifically but perhaps you could give a little more color on that.
Bob Hagemann: I’m not going to detail out each of the initiatives. As I told you, when we launched the previous program it literally included hundreds of initiatives. Many of those are going to continue to carry over into 2010, they’re going to be supplemented with additional initiatives but the areas that we’re focused on are really unchanged.  As I said, we’re going to be looking to continue to standardizing our processes, deploying best practices; we’re looking at using lean principals throughout the business, continued big opportunities on supply chain. As I already said a couple times, billing and collections remains a big opportunity. As we increase electronic ordering I think is going to be efficiencies throughout our business. We’re obviously looking at all of our real estate costs which include footprint and all the other costs associated with real estate. Think of those as the broad categories.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: As a follow up on India, now that you’ve been live there for over a year, can you also talk about how the reimbursement environment has played out and perhaps test mix in that specific country?
Surya Mohapatra: First of all, most of the reimbursement there is self payer so its cash. As far as mix and other things we’re trying to meet the local requirement. Some of the routine testing but our focus there is actually esoteric testing. We talk about specific areas going to take off. We built this facility and its one of the best in the pacific and we’re going to have of the key tests there and some of them to be done in the US.
Operator: That does conclude the question and answer session. Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Fourth Quarter Conference Call.

A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A Powerpoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Dr. Surya Mohapatra.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  Thank you and welcome Kathleen. Demand for diagnostic testing services remains strong and our business is performing well. We drove solid earnings in revenue growth in the third quarter. We also continue to improve the efficiency of our business. During the third quarter, earnings per share grew 26%, revenues grew 4%, and cash flow from operations grew 14%. Based on our strong performance, we have raised our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $3.80 to $3.85. While there has been recent progress in healthcare reform, the terms of the final outcome are still to be determined. We have always been supportive of the goals of healthcare reforms to expand access to quality care, to improve outcomes, and reduce cost. Diagnostics play an important role in achieving these objectives. We’re hopeful that the efforts in Washington will result in better outcomes for patients, which is central to our mission. I will discuss our growth drivers after we hear from Bob on our financial performance.
Robert A. Hagemann:  As you heard, our business continues to perform well. Revenue growth has accelerated. Our profitability has continued to improve and cash flow remains strong. Earnings per share in continuing operations for the quarter were $1.02, 26% above the prior year with the increase principally driven by strong operating performance. $0.05 of the EPS growth is due to two items included in the last year’s third quarter which helped this year’s comparison. A $0.03 shortage associated with an asset write-down and a $0.02 impact from last year’s hurricanes. Consolidated revenues were $1.9 billion, 3.9% above the prior year and our net of 0.4% reduction associated with foreign exchange. Our clinical testing business which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues grew 4.3% above the prior year and over 5% before the impact of our pre-employment drug testing business. Volume was equal to the prior year level. Despite a 23% decline in pre-employment drug testing which reduced consolidated volume by 1.7%, the third quarter volume comparison for the prior year was aided by about 0.5% associated with the impact of last year’s hurricanes. After giving consideration to these factors, underlying volume grew just over 1%, about 1% slower than the second quarter. The increase is principally due to a general softness in our business during the month of August. August volumes tend to be highly variable and are impacted by vacation patterns and the timing of the start of the school year. Nothing that we saw in our August volumes pointed to a reversal of the progress we are making in growing our business. In fact, we saw volume growth rebound in September, placing underlying volume growth for September and July in line with the year-to-date level. Revenue per requisition increased 4.3% with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix and a benefit of just over 0.5% from the Medicare fee increase which went into effect January 1st. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses which include our risk assessment business, clinical trials business, Point of Care testing business, and MedPlus, and contained most of our international revenues was in line with the prior year despite a reduction of almost 4% attributed both to foreign exchange. A table contained in footnotes of the earnings release summarizes the impact of various revenue metrics associated with the number of the items I just discussed. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 18.4%, up from 17.4% last year. The improvement is principally due to more profitable revenue mix and progress we are making with our cost reduction program. The impact of the hurricanes which occurred last year served to aid the year-over-year comparison by about 30 basis points. We continue to see strong and stable performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, consistent with the second quarter. DSOs at 43 days were also consistent with the Q2 level and improved 2 days from a year ago. Our cash flow continues to be outstanding. Cash flow from operations for the quarter improved to $374 million compared to $329 million last year. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $100 million, repurchased $100 million of our stock, and grew our cash balance by $128 million. Turning to our full-year outlook, we continue to expect revenue growth to approximate 3%. We now expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to exceed 18%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $1.2 billion excluding the NID settlement payments or $900 million after such payments. Capital expenditures are estimated at $180 million, and lastly, we have increased our estimate of diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.80 to $3.85. Our business is performing very well. It is growing and becoming more efficient. In addition to driving current performance, we are looking ahead and making important investments which will continue to differentiate Quest Diagnostics and further improve healthcare. These include advancements in science, medicine, and technology. And now, I’ll turn it back to Surya to discuss some of these accomplishments.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  We continue to execute our plan and drive growth. Our strategy is bifocal. We are managing the business of both the short and long term. I will discuss the drivers of growth in the quarter and also the investments we continue to make for the future. Third quarter profitability was driven by top-line growth and ongoing improvements in quality and efficiency. Our cost reduction program continues to improve our productivity and enhance quality and service. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by continued strong demand for gene-based and esoteric testing including cancer diagnostics. Revenues from this test continue to grow faster than the overall revenues. Gene-based, esoteric, and anatomic pathology testing accounts for approximately 35% of all revenues. Anatomic pathology accounts for the majority of our cancer testing revenues. Interestingly, anatomic pathology testing is being supplemented with molecular test such as HPV. HPV cervical cancer testing increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year. In addition, we continue to extend our cancer diagnostics portfolio with the launch of new tests such as EGFR pathway test for metastatic colorectal cancer and our proprietary Leumeta family of plasma-based leukemia and lymphoma test which has grown more than 45% year-over-year. We have seen more than 50% increase in vitamin D testing which is increasingly used for a range of conditions from osteoporosis to cancer to diabetes to heart disease, and testing using ImmunoCAP grew more than 15% reflecting continued addition for this broad-based allergy testing method. Our continued focus on innovation is driving growth today and preparing us for the future. I would like to highlight a few exciting innovations we have recently announced in infectious disease, diagnostics for predicting therapy response, cancer diagnostics and healthcare IT. For example, we recently introduced the first commercial test for the H1N1 flu virus authorized by the FDA for emergency use. Our H1N1 test is a good example of our strength in rapidly developing and deploying innovative diagnostics to improve patient care. In fact, we launched our test a little over 2 weeks after the US government declared an endemic emergency and about 10 weeks later the FDA authorized the test for emergency use. Last week, the FDA granted us emergency use authorization for our H1N1 flu test on our recently introduced newer patient testing platform. We are the only company in the US that the FDA has authorized to both perform the test in our lab and also offer H1N1 test strips to high complexity labs. This will expand the nation’s capacity to perform testing and reduce turn-around time for H1N1 results. We focus our efforts on cancer, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease. Earlier this month, we introduced an innovative gene-based test for cardiac patients that use a saliva sample. This test helps physicians predict response to the blood thinner, Plavix. More of the roughly 1 million patients who undergo stent procedures each year are prescribed Plavix, yet 30% or more of people who have genetic mutations that impede response to Plavix. As a result, they may be prone to developing blood clots and can cause heart attack and stroke. Scripps is the first health system in the United States to offer this gene-based testing as part of its care for patients electing to undergo stent procedures. This saliva based gene test is the forefront of diagnostics for cardiovascular disease. On the cancer front, we collaborated closely with Vermillion on the development of its OVA1 ovarian cancer test which the FDA cleared last month. This multi-anilide test which uses the proprietary algorithm provides a new option for helping physicians assess if a pelvic mass is benign or malignant prior to scheduled surgery. This information is expected to help physicians determine whether to refer a woman with high risk of cancer to a specialist or just a general surgeon. We expect to launch OVA1 in the fourth quarter and have a multi-year exclusive license for the clinical reference laboratory market in the US. We are also the exclusive reference laboratory provider for the FDA cleared HE4 biomarker monitoring test. With HE4 and OVA1 in our portfolio, we are now the only diagnostic testing company to offer FDA cleared test for ovarian cancer patients in the pre-surgical and post-surgical settings. We are differentiating our company through enhanced healthcare IT solutions. More than 150,000 physicians already use our Care360 solution such as Care360 Labs & Meds. This enables them to provide better patient care, build more efficient practices, and qualify for government incentives. Use of our ePrescribe service continues to grow rapidly. Monthly prescription volume grew more than 25% since June and is up 140% since December 2008, to a rate of more than 10 million drugs per year. Additionally, Care360’s mobility features enable patients to check the patients’ lab results and prescription history anywhere any time using a desktop, laptop, or our proprietary iPhone application. We recently announced this service to enable doctors to also prescribe medications remotely. We believe that patient empowerment and personal accountability are essential to quality healthcare. Healthcare IT is a tool to empower patients, helping them to understand and manage their health data. We recently announced our collaboration with TS, a new and innovative, interactive online health education and coaching site. This addition like our collaboration with Google Health and Microsoft Health enabled us to facilitate patient access to their lab data. In closing, we delivered strong results in the third quarter and are raising our earnings guidance for the full year. We are doing what is required for the short term while investing in our future, and we are excited about the growth opportunities before us. We will now take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). The first question is from Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse:  Just a couple questions on the volume side; Bob, I know you mentioned sort of normalizing, looks like the number was up 1.1% last quarter, was up sort of mid 2%, could you just go through, I missed some of the comments, you said August was softer simply because of seasonality through the summer months and that’s kind of unpredictable, and September picked up again, is that what you said?
Robert A. Hagemann:  That’s right, Ralph. As I mentioned, August is a pretty variable month, sometimes it’s affected by the timing of vacations in schools and the like; and while there’s not a direct correlation, we also saw a similar pattern with scripts that were written in the month August, they were down, but as I said earlier, our volumes did rebound in the month of September, and when we look at September and the month of July, those volumes were pretty consistent with what we’ve seen year-to-date. So, we don’t think that there is any thing in the underlying performance that affected August.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse:  So, in terms of your opinion, what’s the underlying growth rate in the volume number sort of excluding some of the one-timers?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Again, as you look at the table that we have in the footnote 7, you’ll see that adjusted is 1.1% for the quarter, but we’re not attempting to adjust for the month of August in there.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse:  And then on the volume, can you talk about if there is typically any difficulties you may face on the volume side in the face of everything you’re doing on the cost side of the business. I’m assuming some of the cost savings is coming from down-sizing to some degree, so, should we think of that as once that stabilizes you would expect it to be easier to may be accelerate volume trends?
Robert A. Hagemann:  I wouldn’t say that there was any connection at all; in fact, what we’re doing on the cost side we believe is also improving service levels. we’re making things more efficient, we’re actually improving service levels, and if anything, I think it’s going to help us grow faster in the future.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse:  My last one, can you talk about any potential flu impact in the quarter and maybe comment on whether you’ve seen any meaningful uptake this month just given all the news out there on swine flu?
Robert A. Hagemann:  We have seen a meaningful uptake in our testing for H1N1, but it’s still a very small piece of our business, and it’s really not having any noticeable impact on the results at this point, and really don’t expect it to have any significant impact for the fourth quarter either.
Kathleen Valentine: When we really look at the H1N1, it’s really a support of our innovative capabilities and the speed in which we brought the test to market is we think an important factor for people to look at.
Operator:  The next question is from Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:  A few things here, just to look back here on the volume question, could you just characterize the growth rates that you’re seeing between routine and esoteric in the quarter, just may be some broad characterization there would be helpful.
Robert A. Hagemann:  As in the past, the esoteric business is growing much faster than the routine, and we expect that will continue. A lot of this is driven by new tests that are introduced, and certainly some of the things that Surya talked about in his prepared remarks are driving volume and revenue growth and we would expect that sort of pattern will continue as we go forward.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And the magnitude of that in the third quarter was what would you say roughly the spread is in terms of the growth rates?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Gene-based and esoteric tends to grow close to double digits while you can see the rest of the business volume-wise was a little over 1% or so.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And, if you could just may be talk a little bit more, I know Surya you mentioned some of these new test launches that you’ve had, maybe if you could give us some indication of how important some of these recent ones might be financially, particularly OVA1, how big do you think that test could becomes, how many tests do you think are out there, and then, I believe you’ve got the Septin test coming in the fourth quarter, could you talk a little bit about the launch and the timing of that?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  First of all, we continue to drive our strategy towards diversification of higher growth and higher margin business, so, whether it is H1N1, whether it is test for Plavix or whether is Septin 9, or whether it is OVA1, they are all using a pipeline of products. Let me just answer some question about OVA1, we walked very closely with Vermillion, this is really a great story, how a small company got involved with a relatively large company and brought in innovations and never give up. In the 22,000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, half of them unfortunately died, but the 290,000 people go to the hospital with a pelvic mass. This is the first test at least to my knowledge where the physician can really triage what kind of surgeons they’re going to send. For example, if the pelvic mass is malignant, then it has to go to an oncological gynecologist rather than just go to a gynecologist or a surgeon. So, it is changing the standard of care. Now, testings are used to find out what kind of doctor is enough. It’s going to take some time to pick up, but it’s going to change the standard of care and we’re very excited. We’re now actually working with the marketing plan and we’re going to launch that test in the fourth quarter. Now, let me tell you a little bit about the Plavix, again, this is a test which is done from saliva, not from blood test, and again, so many people are on Plavix. For 30% of people it doesn’t work because they cannot metabolize this thing. So, now the fact that we work with Scripps Clinic and they have made it a standard of care, people can really do this test at home or in the office and we expect that also our test for Plavix is going to be useful, and again, we don’t have the numbers yet, but within the next 3 or 4 quarters we are going to provide you how this is growing. But, just remember, no one test is going to really move the needle. So, it’s a question of creating a portfolio test.
Kathleen Valentine:  On the Septin 9 test that you questioned about, if you recall, we licensed the right to develop a molecular-based lab test that can help physicians detect colorectal cancer using a patient’s blood specimen instead of a stool specimen; so, that’s a great innovation. So, we’re in test development currently, we’re working diligently to make the test commercially available. We’re also participating in a clinical study to see the effects of this test in detecting as a screening for colorectal cancer. So, we’re making really nice progress on Septin 9 and we’re excited about bringing that test to market.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:  My last question here, just an update please on the India strategy as well as any financial outlook you have with regard to that market; and while you’re on top of India, can you just comment on any other significant developments that we should be looking out for in the other international markets?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  As I have said, internationally, the core strategy for our company and we made an announcement that 10% of our revenue is going to come from international, and we are investing in India, it has taken a little longer than I would have liked, but I’m very pleased to say that the laboratory is completed, we have got CAP, we have got NABL approval, we have made some management changes and now we’re in the process of setting up sales and marketing. The India market is $1 billion, but that’s actually emerging market and evolving market. If you think about jus the potential of 300 million middle class, it’s the same population in United States, we are expecting to have significant growth in India, we’re going to be there for long and it’s going to take some time as you know in international; so, the first thing is we’re going to be in India, we’re going to invest in India, but with that also, we are exploring for example or work in Ireland; that model is a little different and it’s been very successful; we don’t have bricks and motors there yet, but we are helping the Irish Department of Health how to reduce the time taken for cervical cancer screening, and I’m really so excited that the Irish women don’t have to wait for 9 months to get their Pap smear study done, now it’s 10 days. So, again, we will be selective in international market, but we are going to make sure that we are successful where we are whether it is Mexico or whether it is UK or whether it is Ireland and India, but it is really part of our man strategy to grow international business.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Bob, is there a financial update on India and the impact?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Nothing significant at this point; we continue to invest there and I think it’s going to be a net investment for a while, but that investment is still pretty small, probably in the range of a penny impact EPS a quarter right now.
Operator:  The next question is from Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  Just kind of wanted to follow up on the volume question you guys have had, have you seen any changes in the trends as you exited the third quarter and what’s you expectations going forward, have there been any changes?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Kevin, as I said earlier, in September we saw volume rebound pretty nicely and we’re very comfortable with our full-year guidance which implies that Q4 revenue growth is going to be in line with Q2 and Q3.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  And then, can you remind me, does the drugs of abuse testing, the drag that it creates, does that annualize next quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann:  It will probably not annualize until we get into December, that’s really when we saw a drop-off last year; so, coming out of this year is when we’ll see the full impact annualize.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  And then, going back to August, you guys acquired a lab business from a hospital system in Boston, can you talk about how that business is looking with the integration process, what does the landscape look like for other hospital acquisitions?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  Let me make a comment about the landscape and then Bob can talk about the number; what you are seeing now is what we expected, whether it is the recession or whether it is the lack of capital, but the number of hospitals is now realizing how to monetize their outreach business. Once the outreach business grows a little bigger, it doesn’t become efficient, because you have to put money in logistics and billing; so, here we have an opportunity the hospital system decided to monetize their outreach business, but most importantly picked us as a partner to help them to implement information technology, healthcare IT whether it is with their physicians or with the hospital; so, it’s a win-win situation where we can bring the reference studies and they have access to our esoteric laboratories to monetize their inefficient asset and at the same time, we’ve become partners in providing medical information when they want and where they want. So, I will see this trend is going to grow and certainly we really like that because we can bring our laboratory testing to the hospital and they can practice medicine.
Robert A. Hagemann:  Kevin, relative to the integration, it’s proceeding as we do with all integrations; we moved with what I’ll call deliberate speed, and I would expect that towards the end of this year most of that integration will be done. It’s a relatively small transaction; so, it’s not an overly complex integration, but as Surya referred to, the connectivity is an important piece of this and we want to make sure that we get that right.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  Could you guys provide us an update on the landscape and your views on reimbursement as we exit 2009?
Robert A. Hagemann:  One of the things that’s important to understand is that all of our largest contracts are locked in into 2010 or beyond, so the pricing is really set by the terms of those contracts, and there is very little business that we have with third party payers that floats with Medicare rates, so, the fact that we’re having a Medicare rate change is January 1st is going to have very little impact on our managed care.
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets: 
 :
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  Diagnostic testing, did you say?
Kevin Ellich - RBC Capital Markets:  Yes.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Let’s just talk about cancer diagnostics. You have 1.5 million people diagnosed with cancer and almost 560,000 people will die, and our goal is to make Quest Diagnostics as the destination for cancer patients, and that’s why we acquired AmeriPath and that’s why we’re integrating anatomic pathology with molecular pathology and with digital pathology. So, when you put all those three things eventually you will see we will do more and more become the destination for cancer diagnostics for all cancer patients and oncologists; that’s number one. Number two, in the short term, obviously the growth is going to come from esoteric and gene-based testing, but in the medium and long term, we’re not only looking for international but we’re also looking for how the point of care devices can be integrated with IT and take diagnostics to the patient bedside in the hospital. So, we’re pretty excited about the industry, we’re pretty excited about Quest Diagnostics because we could invest in appropriate product portfolio to grow this company short term and long term.
Operator: Your next question is from Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Good morning everybody and thank you for the color so far. Just on looking at the margins, I think Bob, you mentioned that the improvement is due to mix and cost cutting. Your margin expectations have been coming up throughout the course of the year. So, is one side or the other ahead of what you’re expecting?
Robert A. Hagemann: Certainly I feel as though we’re firmly on track with respect to our cost reduction program and the good news about that is that the cost reductions that we’re achieving are going to be sustainable because as you’ve heard me say before these are a result of taking work out of the system rather than just trying to do more with less, and a byproduct of this as well is you’re building in a culture of continuous improvement. In that regard I feel very good about it. We’re tracking exactly where we thought we’d be, maybe a little bit ahead at this point, and we feel as though the progress that we’ve made with this program is going to put us in very good shape going forward to continue reducing our cost and becoming more efficient.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: On that note, how do we think about the longer term; obviously the $500 million has gone very well; the long-term goals, is it still 20% EBIT margins eventually or…?
Robert A. Hagemann: It absolutely is; it is going to be a combination of us continuing to get more efficient but also driving top line growth. At the end of the day we can continue improving efficiencies, but we do need to drive top line growth in order to get to margin expansion that we’ve been talking about and certainly the things that Surya has been discussing, the focus on innovation, the investments we’re making today, I think, has put us in very good shape for the future and put us in a position to actually grow faster than the market over time.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Any timeframe for getting to that 20%?
Robert A. Hagemann: Next several years.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: One more on the cash flow, you ranged your expectations there pretty nicely; can you just remind us how you’re thinking about the priorities there and what the acquisition landscape looks like over and above the hospital billing units?
Robert A. Hagemann: First, let me step back and say our practice continues to be deploy all of the cash that was got and utilize to leverage capabilities that we have in a very prudent way to drive shareholder returns, and yes, the first priority there is to make sure that we preserve our credit ratings. It is important to maintain investment-grade credit rating especially in this environment. It gives us good access to capital and attractive rates and it also gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic as it relates to growth opportunities. With that said, while we’re continuing to operate within the parameters that preserve that investment-grade rating, the first priority has been and will continue to be to invest in growth, whether that being acquisitions, licenses, other opportunities to develop new tests and the like, that’s always the first priority because it creates sustainable shareholder returns. Secondly, to the degree that we don’t have growth opportunities in a particular quarter and we got the capacity, you’ll see us do share repurchases and that’s what we’ve historically done; at this point, we still have about $150 million left under our current share repurchase program, and for the most part we’re going to be in the market in more quarters. As you know, we’re purchasing at least 3 million shares a year to offset the dilution associated with the equity programs that we have here, but to the degree we can do more, we will.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: The acquisition landscape generally speaking?
Robert A. Hagemann: Surya talked about care costs and the fact that hospitals are looking to monetize assets, I think that’s going to continue. I also think as you think about regional laboratories that in the past may have been owned by private equity and are going to have to do some refinancing over the next several years or so; that refinance is going to be more difficult, so I think that’s probably going to create some opportunities also. Then you have the other areas that we talked about as elements of our growth, whether it be point of care business and maybe down the road international as well.
Operator: Your next question is from William Quirk - Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Two questions here; we’ve successfully stayed off the lab packs; Surya you kind of addressed little bit in your prepared comments, but how do we think about; one, the prospects for reform at this point, and then two, the pass-through if any that we might see from the potential device tax being floated?
Kathleen Valentine: As the healthcare reform continues to evolve down in Washington, we continue to believe in the goals of healthcare reform and we think for Quest Diagnostics and the industry we think it will be a net positive; expanding access and coverage for patients who are currently today uninsured is a good thing. The emphasis on prevention and wellness will certainly create a demand for more testing which will certainly benefit us, and then also the focus and incentives that they’re looking at relative to healthcare IT; we have as you’ve heard today and previously, we bring to the table a lot of very helpful healthcare IT solutions that we think will go very well for us and position us very well. We’re not going to speculate on the final outcome of healthcare reform, but net-net we think it will be a good thing when you offset that with whatever comes from the price reduction perspective and as it relates to the notion of the tax on the devices, we’re not going to comment on that, I am not going to speculate there.
Robert A. Hagemann: What I would say with respect to tax on devices at least were a significant portion of the items that we purchased. We have fixed price contracts in place and certainly as we think about working with our suppliers we look for ways to help them reduce their costs so that they can help then manage the cost that they will charge to us. I don’t know how that’s ultimately going to shake out, I think that will have some opportunities to mitigate some of that impact.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Bob, just to follow up there, I assume these are roughly five-year rolling contracts; so we’re looking at something like 20% of vendor contracts coming up each year?
Robert A. Hagemann: It varies; five years is a long time, but we do have multi-year agreements in place with many suppliers.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: To tough on a couple of the balance sheet metrics; continue to see very low carrying of inventory, looks like about 6-1/2 days, down substantially a couple of days or so year over year; how should we think about that going forward; are we bottoming here, how should we think about this moving forward?
Robert A. Hagemann: First of all, I wouldn’t spend a lot of time focusing on inventory, it’s a relatively small asset for us in the scheme of things. Certainly DSOs are the much bigger opportunity for us, but as you’ve seen, we made good progress with both inventories and DSOs. I don’t know if it has to do with the fact that this year, I think I talked about this on the second quarter call; we’ve implemented a program whereby we’re measuring each of our business units and naturally incenting individuals to manage capital deployed in their business which includes both inventories, DSOs, and/or capital spending. As you may have noted, our capital spending is actually a little bit below where we were last year and we’ve actually just reduced our estimate for full-year capital spending by about $20 million as a result of this program.
Operator: Your next question is from Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Co.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Co.: Just a couple of questions here; first, just a followup on volumes; it seems like the concern that rising unemployment rates might have a delayed impact on volume in the back half of the year hasn’t really played out. I am just curious, are you concerned about the end of COBRA subsidy going forward having an impact?
Robert A. Hagemann: As unemployment has ramped up we’ve seen our volume continue to grow. So, while there may be some correlation, there is not a significant direct correlation, and I think that we’ll be able to mitigate much of any potential impact from COBRA dropping off. We haven’t seen a significant change in physician office visits, and certainly what’s driving a lot of our testing is the fact that there are new tests, there is increased demand for testing, and certainly demographics are going to continue to drive it; as people get older, they need more testing. I think that’s some of what we’re seeing in the underlying results.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Co.: On the esoteric side of the business, it seems that the anatomic pathology market has become a little more competitive over the past few years as independent labs get under the market, etc.; would you agree with that, and could you just run through how you view Quest in that market and what your specific advantages are?
Robert A. Hagemann: I wouldn’t say that it has become more competitive because independents have entered the market. I think it’s more of a case where we’ve seen some of customers start to internalize work, the technical component, the professional component, and that’s an industry-wide phenomenon. What I would tell you though is as you think about AP, think about it as an important element of the broader market for cancer diagnostics, and increasingly, we’re seeing molecular tests ordered in connection with the tissues and the other AP work, and that’s where when we step back and look at the market that way, we feel very very good about the way we’re positioned. Certainly, we’ve got the most extensive pathologist network and we believe we’ve got the most extensive molecular test menu. So, we feel very well positioned to grow in cancer diagnostics and AP being a very important piece of it.
Operator: Your next question is from Paxton Scott - Unknown Firm.
Paxton Scott - Unknown Firm: My first question is on the guidance; I know, Q4 last year was particularly weaker due to the economy and you had some non-recurring costs in there related to workforce reductions, but can you remind us if there was anything else that we need to be thinking about in terms of Q4 particularly given that you’ve done about $2.91 in EPS year-to-date and your full-year guidance implies $0.94, the high end; just wanted to know if there is anything else we need to be thinking about there as we model that out?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: There is nothing specific that you should think about in our Q4 this year. I would this statement though relative to last year in that last year’s fourth quarter was actually very strong overall. The volumes were impacted by the drugs of abuse testing business, but the underlying business performed extremely well last year from an earnings standpoint and a cash flow standpoint.
Paxton Scott - Unknown Firm: My other question was on the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule; first, am I correct in saying that about 12% of your revenue is derived from that fee schedule, and secondly, based on the CPIU update and the 0.5% additional reduction, is it correct to say that you’re facing about a 1.9% reduction for 2010?
Kathleen Valentine: The expected reduction that we’re seeing for 2010 on the Medicare fee schedule is 1.9%; so we are looking at that and based on what’s currently proposed, that’s what we’re expecting to see.
Robert A. Hagemann: The other thing to note too is that our Medicare revenues are about billion dollars or so; it’s about 85% of them reimbursed onto the lab fee schedule and about 15% or so reimbursed onto the physician fee schedule.
Kathleen Valentine: Your percentages are about right.
Operator: Your next question is from Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: Back to H1N1 just for a quick second; I know it sounds like it wasn’t a material impact on volumes, but was there an upside from pricing or I should say revenue per requisition?
Robert A. Hagemann: Very modest because again the impact on volumes were so small that it’s not going to move the needle there.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: So your revenue per requisition run rate, if you take out the one-time items, has actually been getting stronger each quarter this year; what is driving that, is it just a matter of esoteric testing becoming a bigger part of mix or is there something else that’s driving that?
Robert A. Hagemann: It’s not just esoteric testing but it’s the continued utilization across the board of various tests. We’re continuing to see an increased number of tests ordered per encounter and a lot of it has to do with new tests that are getting introduced, but also increased demands for things like vitamin D, etc.; so if you were to look at our revenue per requisition adjusted for the things that we have in the footnote, you would see that it has been ramping up slightly, but again, it’s pretty much test mix driven.
Laure Park: If you look at our revenue per requisition in each of the first three quarters, it’s actually almost exactly flat quarter to quarter; it’s relatively flat. So, we’ve been consistently strong growth for each of the quarters.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: I am wondering if you share the number of managed care contracts you’ve negotiated to 2010?
Robert A. Hagemann: We have not, but again, reiterate that majority of our contracts, particularly all the large one are negotiated through 2010 or beyond.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: Just one quick housekeeping; understanding that you did share repurchase during the quarter, it doesn’t seem to be reflected in your share count for the quarter end; is there something else that was going on in issuance during the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: No, I think you have to look to the timing of those share repurchases and the like, but it certainly is reflected in the share count.
Kathleen Valentine: Basically there is a footnote which talks about the increase of the share count.
Operator: Your next question is from Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: Just a quick question on Vermillion, I know that’s the first test FDA approved for ovarian cancer; from what I understand these five specific biomarkers and you have an exclusive for multiple years, but can that test be used or that technology be used to come up with other specific cancer tests?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all, they know these are multi-analyzed tests and we use algorithms. So, it takes a longer time. Will the process be useful for other tests, I think yes, and that’s why actually they’re working on a number of other tests, but this is the one which is the most promising and has gone through the FDA approval and we’re very excited about it.
Kathleen Valentine: On the OVA1 test, the FDA clearance we are going to use and promote this test based on the FDA cleared labeling. The OVA1 test that we’re bringing to market, it will use those five biomarkers coupled with the proprietary algorithm, it will give the numeric indication indicating whether the woman’s pelvic mass is malignant or not. So, that’s how we’re going to market with this test, but to your point and to echo Surya’s comment, we’ll continue to work with Vermillion to see what other uses for those biomarkers that we may be able to use or beyond that, but specific on OVA1 we will promote the test based on the FDA labeling.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: So you do have rights to other potential tests or is it exclusive right now just for ovarian?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: We have some right to other tests.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: Lastly, can you talk about the pricing on this type of test; obviously it’s a high-end test, I would assume it would expensive?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: We’re working with the marketing plan and the reimbursement; it’s too early to really make any comment on that.
Operator: Your next question is from Unknown Analyst - Unknown Firm.
Unknown Analyst - Unknown Firm: I just had a question on cancer diagnostics just generally. You’re seeing a lot of growth in that area and is the growth primarily volume or is it pricing or a combination; can you quantify what is pricing and what is volume, and can you just give me a range of prices for cancer diagnostics, what is the low end and the high end.
Robert A. Hagemann: What I would tell you is think of it as volume driven; again these are principally new tests that are getting introduced and in many cases those tests carry higher reimbursement than the average that we’ve got. So, it is helping the revenue per requisition as well, but in terms of pricing for cancer diagnostics; it runs from a routine Pap smear which is around $20 odd to some very high-end tests that could be in the hundreds, maybe close to $1000.
Operator: Your next question is from Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: I know it’s late in the call here; just a couple of minor questions. First, how do you guys think about, I guess in the fourth quarter you had the easier volume comps; so will we indeed see positive volume growth in the fourth quarter; I know you don’t give guidance, and I am not asking for number, but just in terms of the absolute trends.
Robert A. Hagemann: You should expect that you’ll see positive volume.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: As we think about the industry, how would you guys think about the industry growth rate these days; we’ve seen the impact on volumes and obviously we have the long-term historical trends, but in terms of, as you guys think about your market share and what’s going on more generally speaking for the industry, how would you think about the industry growth rate and how would you compare your growth rate to that as we think about your market share?
Robert A. Hagemann: As we’ve told you in the past, it’s very difficult to get a good handle on how the market is growing, but we do participate in all aspects of the market including the drugs of abuse testing business which is significantly down versus the prior year, but when you look at our total revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range, we think that we’re growing pretty close to what the market is doing right now.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Just one final question; you guys have done an absolutely phenomenal job to reassess the efficiencies in the business and just bringing down costs for the last couple of years or so; are we at the full run rate now, I know you would say by the end of another year what was on the goal, the $500 million that you talked about a while back; is that fully in the numbers now or will it not be until the end of the year?
Robert A. Hagemann: What we have committed to is we’re going to have $500 million as we exit this year, that’s exactly what we’re tracking towards, and we feel very very comfortable, maybe a little bit better than that, but I am trying not to give quarterly numbers on that.
Operator: Your next question is from Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: I just had a quick followup; Bob, I think you touched on it briefly a little bit earlier regarding the insourcing of some of the anatomic pathology work by these larger physician groups; just wanted to get your thoughts on that, and maybe Surya as well; how should we think about this trend going forward and how much of the impact have you already seen in the market; my understanding is that it is being done largely by some of these large urology practices, but what’s the ability of this penetrating and shifting maybe over to different specialties as well and maybe what do you think can be done about this. I know that it’s a function how the reimbursement works and clearly that is an issue that needs to be perhaps fixed over time, but at least over the near term, how do you look at this trend and how should we think about it?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: I think you have evaluated the situation pretty well and as physicians, especially the urologists and the GI specialists want to internalize the TC and PC, it is a competitive change and we’re dealing with it, but we believe that it is a short-term trend rather than a long term. When you look at cancer diagnostics and look at long term what is really happening and that’s one of the reasons why we acquired AmeriPath that it is just not the tissue; anatomic pathology which is morphology and histology is now combined with esoteric testing which is the molecular pathology, and then the question, how do you really get this information to various people knowing there is also shortage of number of specialists. So, we consider the TC/PC challenge is short-term, we have to deal with it. We see our outpatient AP is growing better than inpatient because of the hospitals, but we’re here for the long term, and as I told you that we are investing money to make Quest Diagnostics the destination for cancer patients.
Robert A. Hagemann: The other thing Charles that I’ll add is self-referral, which is what you’ve got in this case, can sometimes lead to over-utilization and we’re doing what we can to try and educate legislators and the like around that. As you saw a number of years ago with the Stark Legislation, there were some loopholes that were closed there and I think over time we might be able to address the same thing here.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Any impact that we’ve seen so far; do you think that the impact could increase over time or do you think any impact you’ve seen in the market is largely the run rate going forward?
Robert A. Hagemann: That’s pretty hard to assess at this point. There might be some additional pressure to do some more insourcing, but as Surya said, over time we don’t see this necessarily as something that we think we’ll continue and could possibly end up reversing it sometime down the line.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Think of it a little bit like hospitals doing outreach, just like clinical pathologists; so this is like internalization and this is nothing new to our industry. When hospital internalizes esoteric testing we have to deal with these things and now we have some specialists trying to internalize it and we have to rise above that and that’s what we’re doing.
Operator: The last question comes from Gary Taylor - Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Two or three question; the first is, I don’t think we explicitly talked about this; I just wanted to come back to it; there is a lot of debate in the market on the commercial contracts heading into next year, how much of those are based on fixed escalators versus CPI-based escalators, and I think you’ve been asked before and have said it is a lower number that’s based on CPI, but could you comment or talk around maybe, if we can’t have that explicit number, what type of difference you might expect in terms of overall commercial pricing, 2010 versus ’09 or what sort of drag the CPI-based component might have?
Robert A. Hagemann: Gary, here is what I would tell you. As we’ve said in the past, very little of our business which is the third-party payers floats with Medicare rates, and while we may have some CPI adjustments in there, in most cases the adjustments that we have are generally fixed-rate adjustments, and in some cases we don’t have adjustments at all. So, I don’t think that the inflation going into 2010 outside of what it does to our Medicare reimbursement is going to have a significant impact on our overall revenue per requisition or our pricing. If you look back over the years, frankly what’s driven our improvements in revenue per requisition has not been pure price increases. It has been test mix and the number of tests ordered per requisition, and that I think is going to continue to be a positive impact for us.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Good, that’s helpful. Second question; wanting to talk about labor costs a little bit and maybe get a sense of the environment helping you, but first a question on the roughly $1.1 billion in cost of services; what percentage of that is labor?
Robert A. Hagemann: Labor makes up about half of our total cost and it is probably not all that different in cost of services.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Are you seeing anything different; I guess what might strike me based on what other companies have told us is maybe the economic environment might be driving say lower turnover in the types of employees that might be drivers and that might be a labor benefit and then maybe actually a deflationary type environment or certain clinical personnel and maybe tech; so could you talk about those two groups and are you seeing any of that?
Robert A. Hagemann: What I would tell you Gary is over the last two years and as I expect going forward, most of the efficiency gains that we achieve are going to be as a result of taking work out of our business and using voluntary attrition to adjust the size of our work force. We continue to make as we did last year, provide merit increases to our employees; it’s important to make sure that we compensate them appropriately, provide appropriate benefits because we want to make sure that we’re tracking and retaining the best that there is. So, we will continue to do that, that’s been our philosophy and I don’t see that changing.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Finally, on the G&A number which has been of sorts being able to take some cost out; what’s the largest total component of G&A expense, would that be where the sales reps are, that labor would be in that line or?
Robert A. Hagemann: You have the selling costs in there, you have bad debt, and you have the billing organization. Those are probably the biggest within there. In addition, you have the overhead and the like that sits in there, but the sales force, the billing organization, and bad debt.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: That’s really labor again that is probably the biggest single component.
Robert A. Hagemann: Absolutely.

The entire contents of the call including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, transmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce, Laure Park, Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. 
Laure Park: Good morning. I'm here with Dr. Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations, or beliefs and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include but are not limited to adverse results from pending or future government investigations, lawsuits or private actions, the competitive environment, changes in government regulations, changing relationship with customers, payers, suppliers and strategic partners, and other factors described in the Quest Diagnostics 2008 Form 10-K, quarterly reports on 10-Quarter, and current reports on 8-K. As noted on the last call, a new accounting rule went into effect January 1st, FAS 160. This requires minority interest be renamed net income attributable to non-controlling interest and companies present consolidated net income that includes an amount attributable to such non-controlling interest for all periods presenting. This change did not impact our previously reported numbers, but did change how our P&L was presented. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later this morning in the quarterly updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A Powerpoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Dr. Surya Mohapatra.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: We made good progress executing our 2009 plan and drove strong financial performance during the second quarter. Total revenues increased 3.5% to $1.9 billion, earnings per share grew 20% to $1.00 per share, and based on our strong performance, we have raised our full year EPS guidance to between $3.70 to $3.80.  Diagnostic testing will play an ever greater role in helping to improve healthcare quality and manage cost. The evidence is clear. Diagnostic testing accounts for less than 3% of total healthcare spending; yet, it drives more than 70% of clinical diseases. Diagnostic testing is essential to detect diseases and monitor therapy. If diseases are detected early, actions can be taken to avoid painful and costly complications.  Lab tests are increasingly being used to identify one’s predisposition to disease allowing individuals to make healthcare lifestyle changes. In areas such as cancer and infectious disease, diagnostics are helping physicians personalize treatment and care for each patient, and diagnostic testing provides critical evidence for evidence-based medical diseases. The current healthcare reform discussions recognize the value of early diagnosis, and we are supportive of the President’s key goals for healthcare reform, expanding coverage, enhancing early detection programs, promoting health and wellness, and reducing overall healthcare costs.  In addition to benefiting from this positive trend, we continue to differentiate our company in a number of ways including our patient-centric culture, six sigma quality, unparalleled access and distribution, and innovative science, medicine, and information technology to help drive growth. I will discuss our growth drivers after we hear from Bob on our financial performance. 
Robert A. Hagemann: As you heard, our business continues to build momentum. Revenue growth has accelerated, our profitability has continued to improve, and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were one dollar, 20% above the prior year, with the increase principally driven by strong operating performance.  Included in our second quarter results are several non-recurring items which for the most part offset each other. Included in “other operating income, net” is a $15.5 million gain contributing $0.05 per share, associated with an insurance recovery, which we disclosed when we reported first quarter results and included in our guidance. That benefit was essentially offset by two charges totaling $13.3 million, or $0.04 per share, reflected in “other expense, net,” which sits below “Operating Income” on the face of the income statement. These two items consist of a $7 million charge associated with an investment write-down, and a $6.3 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt in connection with our recently completed tender. Consolidated revenues were $1.9 billion, 3.5% above the prior year, and are net of a 1.3% reduction associated with foreign exchange and fewer business days in the quarter; each contributing about half of the reduction. Revenues for our clinical testing business, which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues, were 4% above the prior year, and about 5% above, before the impact of our pre-employment drug testing business, a strong improvement from the first quarter. Volume was about half a percent below the prior year, driven by a 24% decline in pre-employment drug testing, which reduced consolidated volume by 1.7%. In addition, last year’s exit from several lab management agreements which did not meet our profitability criteria, reduced volume by close to 1%. Also, the second quarter had fewer business days than the prior year and impacted volume by about half a percent. After giving consideration to these factors, underlying volume grew about 2.5%, up from about 1.5% growth in the first quarter. Revenue per requisition increased 4.6%, with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix, and a benefit of about half a percent from the Medicare fee increase which went into effect January 1. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses, which include our risk assessment business, clinical trials business, point of care testing business and MedPlus, and contain most of our international revenues, was below the prior year by about 2%, which was more than accounted for by a 6% decrease attributable to foreign exchange. These businesses as a group reported a strong profit improvement from the prior year. A table contained in footnote 6 to the earnings release summarizes the impact to various revenue metrics associated with a number of the items I just discussed. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 18.9%, up from 16.8% last year. The improvement is principally due to a more profitable revenue mix and progress we are making with our cost reduction program. The insurance recovery mentioned earlier contributed 80 basis points of the improvement. We continued to see strong and stable performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, improved slightly from the first quarter, and consistent with the prior year. DSOs at 43 days were consistent with the Q1 level, improved one day from yearend, and improved 3 days from a year ago. Our cash flow continued to be very strong. During the quarter we funded the $308 million settlement associated with NID while achieving a debt level which was unchanged from the previous quarter. The settlement payment was reflected as a reduction to cash from operations. Cash generation before this payment exceeded the prior year level by over $80 million. Now, let’s turn to our full-year outlook. We continue to expect revenue growth to approximate 3%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to improve to about 18%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $1 billion, excluding the NID settlement payment, or approximately $700 million after such payment. Capital expenditures are estimated at $200 million. And lastly, we have increased our estimate of diluted earnings per share to between $3.70 and $3.80. We continue to make steady progress in growing our business and improving its profitability through effective execution of our plan. And we are making investments in our business which will further strengthen our competitive position. Now I’ll turn it back to Surya. 
Surya Mohapatra: As you just heard, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We are bifocal –managing the business for both the short and long term. I will discuss the drivers of growth in the quarter and also the investments we continue to make for the future. Second quarter profitability was driven by topline growth and improvements in quality and efficiency. Our cost-reduction program is improving our productivity and enhancing the overall patient and physician experience. Some of these improvements include specimen tracking, and connectivity via Care360. Second quarter revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for gene-based and esoteric testing. Revenues for these tests continued to grow more rapidly than overall revenues and account for approximately 35% of all revenues. We are seeing strong growth in a number of disease categories. Demand is growing for a range of cancer tests. There is particular interest in tests that drive early detection, since most forms of the disease, such as cervical, colorectal, ovarian, and skin cancers, have higher cure rates when the disease is detected early. For example, HPV testing increased more than 10% as we continued to educate physicians about testing guidelines and the benefits of HPV testing with Pap tests. Sexually transmitted diseases remain a major public health challenge in the United States, and the medical community has responded by stressing the importance of screening. As a result, we have seen our volume of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing continue to grow at about 10% annually. Demand is also growing for screening and diagnostics associated with chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, allergies and asthma. For example, allergy testing using ImmunoCAP grew almost 20%. Also, researchers continue to find new links between Vitamin D and a range of conditions from cancer to diabetes and heart disease. As a result, we have seen a more than 50% increase in Vitamin D testing using our proprietary tandem mass spectrometry technology.  We continue to invest to build capabilities that will serve us in the future. During the second quarter we launched a number of innovative new services that will improve outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs. We were the first commercial lab to introduce a laboratory developed test to specifically identify the H1N1 virus. I am proud of our scientists, who, in response to the swine flu crisis, were able to develop and bring to market this test within a few weeks of the initial outbreak. We added important new companion diagnostics. These can help doctors personalize medicine by selecting the appropriate therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and HIV. When it comes to diabetes, Hemoglobin A1c is the cornerstone for the long term management of diabetes patients. During the quarter we expanded our point-of-care offering to include a Hemoglobin A1c test with quality that compares to a laboratory test. We completed a small acquisition of a highly innovative company called OralDNA that provides diagnostic testing to the dental market. Studies have shown a strong connection between periodontal disease and more serious conditions, including heart disease and cancer. We believe that the 140,000 dentists in the U.S. will play a more important role in identifying disease, and I am excited about this new platform for growth. Healthcare IT is a tool to drive patient safety, improved outcomes and appropriate use of diagnostic testing. We are well positioned to play a larger role in our nation’s healthcare information infrastructure. We are already connected to approximately 150,000 physicians, many of whom are in small practices that have been slow to adopt healthcare IT. In addition to ordering lab tests and receiving results online, Care360 allows physicians to qualify for CMS e-prescribing incentives today and, we intend, stimulus incentives in the future. By the end of the second quarter, e-prescribing of medications using Care360 was up over 85% from yearend to an annualized rate of 8.5 million prescriptions, and 30% from the end of the first quarter. Our performance is a direct result of the outstanding contributions of our dedicated employees. One of the ways we attract and retain the industry’s best talent is by investing in them and their health. For example, our HealthyQuest initiative has helped thousands of employees quit smoking, lose weight and adopt healthier lifestyles. As a result, we were recently recognized by the National Business Group on Health as a “Best Employer for Healthy Lifestyles.” In closing, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are raising our earnings guidance for the full year. We are bifocal – doing what is required for the short term and investing in our future growth. We are the leader in a vital and growing industry and are excited about the opportunities before us. Thank you. We will now take your questions.
Operator: At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: I was wondering if you could help us a little bit with the one-timers or maybe when we anniversary some of the volume headwinds, the lab management contracts and drugs of abuse testing, I’m assuming we should get less of a pressure as we moved into the second half of the year.
Robert A. Hagemann:  First on the drugs of abuse testing, that’s a business that we think has probably hit bottom at this point. If you look over the last several quarters, the volumes relative to the prior year had been down by a consistent amount, by about 24-25% or so, but we don’t see that impact anniversarying until late in the fourth quarter this year because it really wasn’t until December of last year that we saw the big drop off to where we are now. The other piece of your question had to do with the lab management agreements, and they actually anniversary in the third quarter, at the beginning of the third quarter.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: In terms of the operating margin guidance, 18% for the year, you’re halfway through. We’re sort of there already. Anything we need to keep in mind for the back half of the year as I would think that we should continue to see sequential improvement in that margin?
Robert A. Hagemann: I think what you’ll see is continued improvement over the prior year as we get into the back half. Remember that the first half of this year has the benefit of the insurance settlement in it which was 80 basis points in the quarter and about 40 basis points year to date so far, but in the back of the year, we do expect to see continued improvement versus the prior year. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Last wee, we had the CPI release which obviously translates to a 1.9% decline for the Medicare fee schedule next year. First, is there anything you or the industry can do to change that, or it is what it is, and then secondly can you remind us how you negotiate your managed care rates, and is it hinged on Medicare and/or CPI?
Laure Park: As it relates to the CPI, as adjusted for the 50 basis points, that’s legislated by the 2008 bill, so right now that’s in effect, but what we’re working to do along with the industry is to deal with the proposal that’s sitting in one of the bills around to having a productivity adjustment as well which we’re vigorously working with on the trade association. As it relates to our health plan contracts, very few are linked directly to Medicare changes. Some are CPI, and some others have different modifiers going forward, but each contract is unique.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: When you say some are linked, any way to quantify that?
Robert A. Hagemann: It’s a very modest amount—a small percentage of our total contracts. Most are separately negotiated fee schedules.
Laure Park: And not linked to the Medicare fee schedule.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: With the margins and the opportunity there, you guys have done a great job. As you think about the initiatives that you’ve put in place to drive that margin growth, how much of it is still left to come? I am just curious in terms of all of the things you guys have been doing, are we at the tail end here?
Robert A. Hagemann: First, with respect to the program, we’re firmly on track there, fully committed to deliver the $500 million by the end of this year, and as I mentioned in the past, the gains that we’re getting there or the benefits that we’re getting there, are really sustainable cost reductions because of the fact that we’re taking work out of the process by redesigning the process using LEAN, six sigma and the like, so we feel very good about that. In terms of what’s next and where we go from here, we’re constantly thinking about what’s next and how to build on what’ve already established, and rather than you thinking about a new big program, I’d rather us be thinking about what we’re going to build on from the existing program to drive further improvement. The thing to remember about the program that we’ve got in place is there are not one or two really big items that are driving all the save here. This consists of many small initiatives that we’re executing very rigorously, and it’s that sort of rigorous execution that we’re going to continue to apply against all of our processes and against all of the ideas that we continue to generate, so think of this more as a continuous improvement process as we go forward, rather than announcing a big program again.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: As we think about testing, it’s helpful you breakout the impact from some of those non-core item, but as we think about the business as we separate routine from esoteric, I just wanted to get some color in terms of what you saw in another quarter. Has the volume growth help up in esoteric testing pretty well? If you’re not able to provide specific numbers, if you could just speak about it from a very high level, that would be great.
Robert A. Hagemann: Certainly the gene-based and esoteric testing continues to be the fastest growing pieces of our business, but we’ve seen improvement in both the routing testing as well as that piece of the business, so we feel good that all the aspect of the business are continuing to grow here.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: There was a question earlier on the impact from Medicare. The clinical lab fee schedule you were talking about before, but with the physician fee schedule and some of the proposed cuts there, this carries in terms of how you’re thinking about that. I know it only impacts a small percentage of your business, but still I wanted to get your thoughts. Also last quarter, there was some discussion in the industry about MUEs and the impact of that, so I was just curious in terms of whether that reverses itself in the second quarter.
Robert A. Hagemann: Adam, as you said, the physician fee schedule impact is a much less significant impact to us. It’s going to be less than $10 million the way we size it at this point, and with respect to MUEs, we’ve never identified that as a significant impact to us, and in fact many of the edits that were put in have been pulled back at this point.
Laure Park:  And that modest impact was on cash timing only, not on revenue recognition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of   
Laure Park: Your next question comes from the line of William Quirk - Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Surya, I just wanted to talk a little bit about healthcare reform. You mentioned it briefly in your opening comments. I think most of us are probably keeping a pretty close eye on the Baucus Senate Finance Committee for guidance. I’d love your current thoughts here.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:   All of us know that healthcare reform is required. Healthcare itself in the US is very complex, very costly, and frankly very confusing. What is really good for this industry is that you cannot practice evidence-based medicine without evidence, and the laboratory testing is one of the main testing you do to really get objective data, so we’re actually very supportive of the President’s goal to increase expanded coverage and enhance early detection programs and also promote healthcare and wellness and also use of healthcare IT to reduce costs. One of the most difficult things at the moment whether it’s primary care or whether it’s hospitals or whether it’s rehab centers, there is a lot of inefficient handoff between the parties, so we’re strongly in support of healthcare reform, but very fortunately laboratory testing is only 3% of the total healthcare cost, but now the administration and the medical community is realizing the value of diagnostic testing, so we’re in a very good position and we’re helping the administration as much as we can as far as recognizing the value of diagnostic testing.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: As we think about the various bills making their way through committees and such, how should we think about them?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Here are some of the things we look at. First of all, as I said, we don’t have a crystal ball, but all we have is thoughtful consideration of some of the factors. Access is positive—expanded access. When you bring in 20 or 30 million people out of the 47 uninsured, that’s positive for this industry. Doing testing, whether it’s for illness or wellness, that’s positive. Healthcare IT for our company is positive. Obviously something is probably going to be negative which will be the reimbursement or fee schedule, but as you know as far as our company is concerned, we have gone through some of those things, so we know how to really modify some of the operating efficiencies to really have a sustainable margin.
Laure Park: And on that front, we’re also keeping to educate them that over the past several years the clinical laboratory industry has been impacted to some degree disproportionately on the negative side from the fee schedule adjustments on care to durable medical equipment or outpatient services, and we’re working to educate key members of both sides of the aisle in House and Senate on those changes.
Robert A. Hagemann: And when you think about, just about every provider is going to have some pressure as it relates to reimbursement, but if you look at the lab space, we’re 3% of the total spend, so it’s not where the big dollars are. 
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: So would it be safe to assume guys that you’re not expecting a major turn in reimbursement changes in the relatively near term—in other words, the CPI less 50 basis points deal, maybe a good thing to look at in terms of your barometer here?
Laure Park: Bill, we’re not looking at any type of draconian cuts based on what’s being discussed currently. The only thing definitively that’s under discussion right now is the productivity adjustment onto the CPI. Beyond that, it’s really I don’t think appropriate for us to speculate what type of components might be on the Senate side. We’ve not seen anything specifically outlined at this point.
Robert A. Hagemann: One other point on that, Bill. The productive adjustments, as we’re looking at those too, the incremental impact of that is not overly material either—again less than $10 million as we calculate it.
Laure Park: And maybe to put it into context, at this point in time, we’re looking at on the CPI adjustment based on what’s currently in place, we’re looking at about $25 million impact to the company which is clearly less than one half of 1%.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Inventory levels continued to tighten up. Bob, is there a level here or turn ratio that you’re targeting?
Robert A. Hagemann: Not a specific turn ratio, but it’s interesting that you noticed that. This year, we have made a concerted effort to manage capital more efficiently, and in fact we have deployed a capital charge to each of our businesses to get them to more focused on managing capital very effectively, and it’s actually worked very well. I think that we have wrung out some excess capital out of the system, and obviously as you know the less capital that you need to operate your business the more that you’ve got available to grow your business. So not a specific target there per se. As you look at our balance sheet, inventory is not a big number. The big opportunity really is in DSOs, and I think we continue to do a good job there in managing those down and keeping those under control.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.:   Just looking at the guidance relative to what you guys put up here in the quarter, particularly on the interest expense, I understand here that there is early extinguishment of debt, and should we think about the interest expense going forward sort of at this current level, and if so, it seems like you’re going to benefit by a couple of pennies per quarter. Am I thinking about that correctly, or is there something else that I should consider here as we think about the back half of the year in terms of guidance?
Robert A. Hagemann: Just to give you some perspective. We don’t provide a specific guidance on interest expense, and obviously the tender is going to help reduce interest expense in the back half of the year, but it’s not a couple of pennies in a quarter. At best, it’s a penny a quarter.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Staying home with guidance here, just wanted to ask about the volumes. Obviously you’re doing a lot better here than maybe some people had expected, and particularly the revenue growth here in the second quarter. At what point would you feel comfortable feeling, 3% revenue growth maybe at the low end of range, and we could see something better than that, or is there anything else out there in the future that we should consider why 3% remains the target and the trajectory you’re on as we move to maybe easier comps in the back half of the year?
Robert A. Hagemann: Certainly, if you just look at the full year guidance for about 3%, it implies that the back half of the year is going to be as strong as we saw in the second quarter. I would tell you that it’s a little premature for us to be thinking about raising revenue guidance, but I’m glad that at least you’re thinking about at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities:   I want to just go back to the volume question and wanted to get some commentary from you about what your salesforce is seeing in the physicians there. Has there been any kind of broader based recovery that’s led to your test volumes? Can you just comment on the tenor of the activity in the system throughout the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: First, I would tell you that it’s very hard for us to assess actually what’s happening in physician offices. Anything we get there is very anecdotal, but what I would tell you is that we’re continuing to effectively execute our plan, and this is all about blocking and tackling and effectively selling, and selling a value proposition which includes a comprehensive menu, includes superior service, and that’s what we’ve been doing over the course of the last year, and that’s why I think we’ve seen steady improvement in our underlying volumes, and that’s why we’re confident in the guidance that we’ve got out there for the remainder of the year.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: If I could maybe just shift to swine flu testing and just a couple of questions there, I know you had a release in May that Surya referenced, where do you stand with regard to how you and the industry might coordinate with public health entities? I just wanted to better understand how you think some surge in volume activity in the fall or winter may play out relative to this flu and can you just help us think about that and whether you saw any kind of activity in the quarter relative to the new PCR test?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all, I’m very proud of the way we’ve brought this laboratory developed test in the market very quickly, but obviously this is a pandemic, and we’re working with the State Department, CDC, and the FDA, and we’re getting ready. Hopefully it’s not required, but if required, we will be able to provide testing for the patients and the physicians, but over the last few months, we have not seen enough to move any number, and again there is a lot of discussion going on to prepare the country in case this happens, and the most important thing for us is that we have a test which can be done commercially. 
Laure Park: And while the volumes, Darren, weren’t big enough to move the overall results, they were higher than what we would see in a normal off season for flu perspective.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: On the pathology front, I wanted to get some comments from you about your progress in recruiting clinical leadership for that business. I think it was a few months ago that we saw a New York Times ad for a number of posts in your pathology business, and I just wanted to put that into perspective relative to clinical leadership within that business line.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all, as Bob said and you have seen, we’re building this company in a number of platforms, whether it’s patient centricity, or whether it’s growth through acquisition or organic growth, or developing people, so a few months ago you saw that we hired our first chief medical officer, and he’s not a pathologist. He is Dr. Jon Cohen. He was advisor to Governor Patterson, and he is a vascular surgeon. Our head of science and innovation is Dr. Jay Wohlgemuth; he is a cardiologist, and what we’re trying to do, as we told before that we’re going to be laser focused on cancer, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease, we’re building up this science and medical leadership in this company so that we can leverage 800 MDs and 100 PhDs we have. Now, here is what is happening to healthcare. As you saw, the demand has grown by cancer testing. Whether we like it not, every year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with cancer and also half a million people will die, but the good news is that there are 10 million who survived their cancer, so whether it’s skin cancer, breast cancer, prostate or colorectal cancer, we have the ability to do the test and provide the information, so that’s the reason why we are enhancing our medical and scientific leadership and our future is based on actually how we deliver this information to this three large categories along with chronic diseases.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: Have you completed those?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: This is a continuous process, and as we go on, we will keep at it. We refine people, we add people, but you’re seeing a new structure, and one other comment I want to make is one of the reasons why we’re doing good is sales is because we changed our approach to sales and we have new leadership in sales, and for the last 10 or 12 months, we have been very focused on how to really call on various customer categories, whether it’s physicians or whether it’s hospitals or whether it is the insurers, but in the physician business, we have new leadership driving the engagement to our customers.
Laure Park: Just a point of clarification, Darren, those two ads were actually for people to out to our Nichols Institute to expand on capabilities on the cancer site there.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: You will see more of this kind of activities going forward, whether it’s personalized medicine or whether it’s company diagnostics or clinical trial. We’re going to expedite some of the science and innovation hires.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets:   Just going back to healthcare reform, I know it’s been discussed quite a bit this morning, but I was curious if you could talk about what opportunities there are. You talk about the healthcare IT initiatives and what not, but what other opportunities and challenges do you guys see coming from healthcare reform?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Let me first talk about the challenges. We’re all supportive of the healthcare reform, but it’s a complex issue, so the most important thing is to have real appropriate thoughtfulness to figure out how do you really expand coverage, how are we going to get the money, and as you know we still have a lot of deficit as far as where the money is going to come from, but while the legislators and the regulators are trying to have a discussion, from our industry point of view, we find very positive indications of where could help to reduce healthcare costs. For example, if you diagnose disease at an early stage, the total lifecycle cost for the patient goes down. For example, you may expend $600 for diabetes to say $15000 after detection if you’re not taking care of it. Simple tests for wellness can keep people away from the hospital, so I think there is a culture required with all of us to take care of our health along with the government helping us to give some incentive on various areas, so from diagnostic testing point of view, I think it’s very positive, and we’re getting ready, as you said, continuously to really see what the government is doing. Now, one thing in this company, if you see two or three years ago, we instituted a wellness business, so there’s another opportunity on prevention and wellness, and we have a division to provide that kind of mass diagnostics required, whether it’s employer based or with a health plan. To talk a little bit about healthcare IT, the most important reason why the IT adoption has not been there is because most of the doctors are into 1- to 3- physician practice, and it’s very difficult for big companies to go and approach them, and we’re so fortunate that we have 150,000 doctors who are on Care 360, and they can get money now for e-prescriptions, and going forward, I think it’s an opportunity for us to stimulate growth when we introduce the meaningful use of some of those healthcare IT.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: Thinking about the uninsured, if indeed there is some sort of mandatory coverage, what percent of your bad debt comes from the uninsured versus copays and deductibles?
Robert A. Hagemann: Most of our bad debt actually comes from the uninsured. The bad debt associated with copays and deductibles obviously is higher than the overall bad debt, but most of it comes from the uninsured. If your think about our patient bill, roughly 13% of our revenues are from patients with about a half of that associated with the uninsured, and about half of that deductibles and copays.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: If indeed these uninsured people all of a sudden have coverage, do you see an increased market opportunity as they are going into the physician office and maybe the doctors will be ordering more lab tests?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: I think the physician should order whatever the test that is required for the patient, but obviously there are more people in the system depending on actually what kind of people that will go to the physician office, but I don’t know…
Robert A. Hagemann: If your question was do we think that the folks that are uninsured today who will be insured in the future are going to have a different level of utilization, I don’t see that necessarily.
Laure Park: But the opportunity is, if we are looking at are they come into the doctor’s office versus the ER, absolutely. That’s an opportunity for us, where most of our work does originate in the physician office setting.
Robert A. Hagemann: The broader opportunity has to do with the increased awareness of the value of diagnostics and early detection, like Surya was talking about before. When you look at what’s the essential healthcare benefit, that’s expected to include lab services, and that’s important recognition of the value that we bring.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: And those people do end up in the emergency room, and that is what the administration wants to avoid because it’s very expensive. Once you have the coverage, they can have doctors and then they can be under physician care, and that’s going to reduce catastrophic illnesses. 
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets:  With the swine flu and H1N1, did you see any impact on volume in the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann: Nothing that would move our numbers at all. It was very small volume, but as Laure said, higher than we typically see during a non-flu season, but certainly nothing to move the needle.
Kevin Ellich – RBC Capital Markets: Could you talk about the uses of cash, I guess where do you stand on the buyback? I don’t think you repurchased any stock during the quarter, but given where the stock is today, how attractive do you view that?
Robert A. Hagemann: I’m not going to get into making comments about the attractiveness of the share price, but as you know, all of the cash that we generate, we deploy, and it’s going to be deployed in one of three areas—either further debt repayment, share repurchases, or acquisitions, and while there’ll be some further debt repayment, most likely over the course of the year, we’re in a position now where we can give a lot more consideration to acquisitions and share repurchases, and frankly the priority between those two would be acquisitions as it always has been because those can create sustainable growth for us, and when acquisitions aren’t available either on a timely basis or at the right price, that’s when you see us deploy the excess cash into share repurchases, and while we may not be in the market every quarter for share repurchases, over the course of a year though, you should expect at a minimum we’re going to be repurchasing enough to offset the dilution associated with benefit plans which translates into about 3 million shares a year or so, but you should expect that in every quarter, we’re going to make good use of the cash that we generate and deploy it to drive shareholder value, and in this quarter unfortunately we had $300 million that we needed to fund which we did without adding incremental debt at the end of the quarter, so I feel very good about the cash flow generation and the ability to continue deploying that to drive shareholder value.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs:   I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your contracting relationship with HealthNet given the news on the United acquisition? 
Robert A. Hagemann: Shelley, we don’t comment on specific arrangements with payers.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: My question being I was wondering if there is a chance that Quest could lose some of the HealthNet lives that they could be migrating out with United with the acquisition.
Laure Park: Keep in mind, Shelley, that HealthNet has only sold their Northeast business which is a limited number of lives; therefore, the impact to us to the extent that we lose some of that volume is very limited.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: On the CPI, I know that the administration is looking to put these productivity cuts in place as well. It sounds like that would reduce the Medicare rate by a further 1.5%, if I’m getting that right.
Robert A. Hagemann: Shelley, as I said earlier, that impact would be less than $10 million to us.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: No, I’m wondering if that is in place, if the administration is targeting 2010, and then my question would be does that have any long-term implications on your negotiations with managed care if the administration is successful is getting some productivity cuts out of rates?
Robert A. Hagemann: Shelley, as we said earlier, our managed care contracts are all negotiated separately, and each one is a separate negotiation, and over the years as Medicare has moved either up or down or have been flat for many years, it really hasn’t impacted those discussions, and as we said earlier, it’s a very small piece of our contracted business that is linked to the Medicare schedule. Frankly, what’s driven our improvement in revenue per requisition and what continues to drive it as we look ahead is the mix of business shifting to more esoteric and gene-based test as well as the utilization—increased number of tests ordered per requisition, and we expect that that will continue to drive improvements in revenue per requisition going forward.
Laure Park: I think an important illustration is that literally since 1997, the industry has received only three CPI adjustments; yet, since 1997, we’ve driven continuous improvement in our revenue per requisition. 
Shelley Knoll – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful, but I’m thinking more of on the productivity side. I am wondering if the administration sees an opportunity to trim rates further, whether the productivity piece of this could flow through to managed care negotiations. Maybe my question is how far in advance are some of your bigger contracts negotiated? Do they tend to be 1 to 3 years in duration? Have those escalators already been in place or are they at risk as the terms are renegotiated? Is there is potential for managed care to also seek productivity adjustments?
Robert Hagemann: Shelley, there is a potential for them to do anything, but there is a separate negotiation which is based upon the value that we bring to each payer, and that discussion is independent of what the government is doing.
Laure Park: To your question on contracting, all of our major contracts extend beyond 2010 at this point in time. They are multiyear in nature and very much distinct discussions.
Robert Hagemann:  And the pricing in those is negotiated and predetermined. In some cases, there are scheduled increases. In other cases, there may be opportunities for the payer to get further volume discounts based upon moving work to us, and in some cases, we have no adjustments to pricing over the contracted term, but as we already said, all of our big contracts are negotiated for multiple years at this point, and the pricing in those contracts is set and is independent of what is happening with the Medicare fee schedule. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair:  Just a couple of followups for you on a comment you just made about revenue per requisition growth being driven by mix shift as well as an increase in tests per requsition. I’m assuming it’s mostly mix shift at this point. Is that fair and then also in terms of the tests per requisition, what are the trends that you are seeing currently? 
Robert Hagemann: Amanda, it’s really a combination of both. It continues to be obviously the mix shift, but as we introduce new tests, you have to recognize that many of those are ordered in conjunction with other tests, so that’s driving utilization and increasing the number of tests ordered per requisition. Another way to think about it is just the volume of testing is going up while the volume of patient encounters is going up at a slower rate, and I think you’ll continue to see that as we continue to introduce new tests, that will drive additional tests per requisition or test per encounter. 
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: And then also you talked some about the routine side of the business. Could you provide some color on AmeriPath and where we stand there? I think in the past you had talked about some weakness on the hospital side. Are you still seeing that? Maybe just give a little perspective on how that business is going.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all, AmeriPath integration is going well. As you know their hospital part, the facility, is already fully integrated with our hospital business. As far as cancer diagnostics, it remains number one, and what we are trying to do now is trying to get sales leverage by cross-selling to primary care for skin cancer. Cancer diagnosis remains number one, and we still and as you said we have increased our testing on the outpatient tissue volume rather than the inpatient.
Laure Park: Absolutely, Amanda. As Surya said the outpatient has been definitely stronger than the inpatient tissue volume coming through with AmeriPath.
Robert Hagemann: What we are seeing to is increases in molecular testing associated with anatomic pathology as well, so as Surya said we really need to start thinking about it as cancer diagnostics rather than just anatomic pathology because that’s what’s growing the cancer testing.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: On the reform issue again, one of the things that seems to keep resurfacing is this whole concept of bundling. What is your perspective on that and in your conversations with people on the Hill, is that something that you think could be incorporated into reform?
Laure Park:  Amanda, we are not going to speculate on it. Obviously, we have a lot of questions in regards to how some of that would be implemented, so we are not going to speculate. We are continuing to learn more and obviously to talk to the Hill about the process. 
Amanda Murphy – William Blair:  If it was implemented, do you have any idea what, I guess it depends on how it’s structured, but…
Laure Park: The devil is in the details, absolutely.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  Not only how it is structured, how will I administer because having _DRG in the hospital is very different than outpatient. It’s a very complicated proposition to bundle for ambulatory patients.
Robert Hagemann:  There’s the practicality issue that you have to deal with.
Amanda Murphy – William Blair: Last quarter, I think you mentioned that there were some expenses that were deferred. Do you have any perspective on when those might flow through to P&L?
Robert Hagemann:  As we think about that, a lot of those expenses, and I think I said this at the end of the first quarter while some of those are going to flow through the P&L later in the year, sometimes the longer you go without spending something, the more likely you’re to realize that maybe you didn’t need to spend it in the first place, and I think that’s what we are realizing here, so some of those expenses will not come back through the P&L. Others will come back later in the year, but all that’s baked into our guidance at this point. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Anthony Vendetti – Maxim Group:  On the genomic and esoteric testing, I know you said 35% was the number this quarter as a percent of the revenues. If you stripped out anatomic pathology or if you want to include it, where do you see genomic and esoteric testing going as a percentage of revenues over the next 3 to 5 years, and then the followup question is just going to be on unemployment as it approaches 10% or a little over 10% in certain states, what impact, if any, do you see in 2010 on that?
Laure Park: Well, I think as to where do we see the 35% number going to, obviously the gene based component is clearly more, and more testing is being performed using a gene base. What’s important is that number can’t grow for ever. What’s esoteric today is going to become routine tomorrow, and that’s not a bad thing. It means the test is growing in importance and more and more people are using it, so while we would see that number growing up, we don’t see it moving to being 50% or more of our business. It’s important for us to keep a good strong pipeline to keep driving new tests to be introduced so that things become more routine, that we’re introducing new valuable tests to physicians and their patients.
Robert Hagemann:  Anthony, with respect to the unemployment question, over the course of the last year, we have seen unemployment rise significantly, yet our underlying volume when you strip out the drugs of abuse testing business has been steady and has started to grow, and while we are not totally immune from further unemployment, I do expect that we’ll continue to grow our business. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:  Surys or Bob, the e-prescribing volumes you threw out there, a huge jump there, but you don’t see any economics in the actual volumes, do you? You’re not paying on a per click basis? 
Laure Park:  Robert, the reimbursement is a monthly reimbursement per prescribing doctor, so that’s where the revenue comes through.
Dr. Surya Mohapatra: You’ll get some, but it’s not really significant yet, but the important thing is that we have a product, people like it, and actually now we are reaching those areas where a bigger company cannot, so today they’re getting e-prescription from CMS, tomorrow they might the stimulus money, but the most important thing as I said is the stickiness which we have created with our customers. 
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:  Okay, so thoughts of ever charging on a per prescription basis that you could get a nickel or something? 
Dr. Surya Mohapatra:  We have a small revenue model, but it is not significant at all.
Robert Hagemann: It’s not a per click model at this point. 
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:  Can you explain the economics on that new MedPlus relationship with the New York Clinical Information Exchange? How does the money flow on something like? 
Laure Park:  Robert, each HIE negotiation looks a little different. With many of the HIEs what the initial streams look like is a negotiation for the creation and development of the pipe so to speak as well as the software that’s going in. As it relates to ongoing revenue models, they look a little different across the various HIEs.
Dr. Surya Mohapatra:  It’s licensing and then it is service, but also we are acting as a system integrator, so we get to charge them for our work. 
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:  Okay, but still no transaction event driven revenue model. This is all license fees. 
Robert Hagemann:  There is the potential for that, Robert, and each one of these is a little bit different quite frankly. You’ve seen one, you’ve seen one, basically. 
Laure Park:  But clearly we think across the country you are going to continue to see more and more of these exchanges being developed, and those will evolve as people get more experience. 
Robert Hagemann:  There will be some opportunity for continuing ongoing revenue, but again those models are still developing at this point.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:  And did you mention what the asset write-off was, Bob, the investment write-off that had? 
Robert Hagemann:  I did not. It was just a small equity investment that we had made that the accounting rules at this point require us to write down. 
Operator:  The last question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: It seems to me this was a pretty important quarter in terms of just looking at payer mix and capturing any change in buy-down that perhaps would have started flowing through in the Q1, and now you’ve got an additional quarter to look at it, so I just wondered if you might just comment on payer mix here to date, and it sounded like the comments you had made just about self-pay being 13% of revenues, half copays, half uninsured, it sounds like that’s pretty unchanged, so is it fair to say overall that mix and buydown really haven’t moved much on total payer mix year to date? 
Robert A. Hagemann: I think that’s a fair assessment at this point. When you’re talking about mix, you’re talking about mix of patient pay versus third party pay?
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Correct.
Robert A. Hagemann: No, that has not changed substantially over the course of the year. As always, there is a little bit more of patient pay in the first quarter prior to people hitting their deductibles and the like, and as a result, we always have a slightly higher percentage of bad debt in that first quarter, but nothing different this year from historical trends.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: And can you give us the balance sheet allowance against AR?
Robert A. Hagemann: I don’t have t handy. It’ll be in the 10-Q when it’s filed, but it has not changed significantly.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Backing up to the 1Q, the bad debts have been stable, actually down a little bit in the 2Q, the DSO trend has been stable, actually down a little bit in the 2Q, but if you look at the first quarter, your allowance as a percent of gross AR dipped a couple of hundred basis points sequentially. What do you attribute that to? I mean theoretically that would suggest the mix of the gross AR had improved. Is that rate increases on the commercial side making commercial AR grow a little faster, or why would the gross AR mix have improved in the 1Q?
Robert A. Hagemann: It could be driven by a whole bunch of things. It could be driven by improvements in the agents. It could be driven by the timing of writeoffs, etc., and what I would tell you is with respect to the adequacy of that allowance and the reserves that we’ve got out there, I feel very good about that, and I do not expect there to be any surprises. We’ve got a very rigorous process around that. It’s reviewed by a dedicated team here. It gets a lot of attention from our auditors as you’d expect, and any movement that you see in that reserve would be for the most part principally driven by just the timing of writeoffs and really nothing else. At the end of the day, I think the way to get comfortable with your receivables and the adequacy of the reserve there is watch the DSOs, watch the bad debt, and if they’re going in opposite directions, there is an issue. If they’re going in the same direction, generally you should feel pretty good. The other think you need to do is watch the cash at the end of the day, and you’ve seen, the cash flow has been very strong in the quarter.

The entire contents of the call including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce, Laure Park, Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics.
Laure Park: Good morning. I'm here with Dr. Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations, or beliefs and which involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include but are not limited to adverse results from pending or future government investigations, lawsuits, or private actions, the competitive environment, changes in government regulations, changing relationship with customers, payers, suppliers and strategic partners and other factors described in the Quest Diagnostics 2008 Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. Also, a new accounting rule went into effect January 1st, SFAS 160. This requires minority interest to be renewed, net income attributable to non-controlling interest, and companies must present consolidated net income that includes amount attributable to such non-controlling interest for all periods presented. This change did not impact our previously reported numbers, but did change how our P&L was presented. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later this morning in the quarterly updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A power point presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Dr. Surya Mohapatra.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  We are off to a great start in 2009. During the first quarter, earnings per share increased 24% to $0.89 per share, revenue increased to $1.8 billion, operating income increased to 17.8%, and cash flow increased to $273 million. We are executing our strategy and driving results. We got profitable organic revenue growth, and the growth continues to be driven by our focus on growing esoteric testing including cancer diagnostics. We continue to reduce our cost structure and drive sustainable efficiencies. We are committed to enhancing the patient experience with a range of innovations. As a result of our strong performance, we increased our next guidance and now expect EPS to be between $3.65 and $3.75. After we hear from Bob, I will address our progress.
Robert A. Hagemann:  As you heard, our business performance has continued to improve off an already strong base. Revenues, earnings, and cash flow have all grown and we remain confident in our prospects for continued growth. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.89, 24% above the prior year with the increase principally driven by strong operating performance, and to a lesser degree lower interest expense. Revenues were $1.8 billion, 1.3% above the prior year. Revenues for our clinical testing business which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues were 2.2% above the prior year and about 3% above before the impact of our pre-employment drug testing business. Volume was 1.9% below the prior year, driven by a 25% decline in pre-employment drug testing volume which reduced consolidated volume by 1.7%. In addition, the exit last year from several lab management agreements which did not meet our profitability thresholds reduced volume by about 1%. Also, this year’s first quarter had fewer business days than the prior year and impacted volume by about 1%. After giving consideration to these factors, underlying volume grew about 1.5% in line with a slightly better than the rate we exited last year. Revenue per acquisition increased 4.1% with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix and a benefit of about 0.5% from the Medicare fee increase which went into effect January 1. Revenue in our non-clinical testing businesses which include our risk assessment business, clinical trials business, Point of Care testing business, and MedPlus, and contained most of our international revenues was below the prior year by about 8% with the entire decline due to foreign exchange. In total, foreign exchange reduced consolidated revenue growth by almost 1%. Despite the lower revenue for these businesses, their aggregate profits exceeded the prior year level. A table contained in the footnotes for the earnings release summarizes the impact of various revenue metrics associated with the number of the items I just discussed. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 17.8%, up from 15.7% last year. The improvement is due to a more profitable revenue mix and progress we’re making with our cost reduction program as well as discrete cost containment actions we took during the quarter. We continue to see strong performance in our billing and collection metrics. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.5%, 30 basis points improved from the prior year. DSOs at 43 days, improved 5 days from a year ago and 1 day from year end. Our cash flow continued to be outstanding. Cash from operations increased to $273 million for the quarter compared to $158 million last year. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares at an average price of $44.48 for a total of $250 million and we made capital expenditures of $40 million. Now, let us turn to our full year outlook for continuing operations. We continue to expect revenue growth to be approximately 3%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to improve to about 18%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $1 billion before the NID settlement payment or approximately $700 million after such payment. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $200 million. And lastly, we have increased our estimate of diluted earnings per share to between $3.65 and $3.75 which includes a second quarter benefit of $0.05 per share associated with an insurance recovery. We’ve been proactive in comparing for changes in the business climate in capitalizing on opportunities. This has not only allowed us to perform well in a difficult economic environment but has positioned us to further strength in our competitive position and to further improve our outlook for the year. Now, I’ll turn it back to Surya.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  We are making good progress in executing our strategy which is based on patients, growth, and people. I’d like to review our growth drivers in the first quarter, look at the current climate, and to update you on some of the ways we are planting the seeds for future growth. Our business is moving to a higher value esoteric, gene-based, and anatomic pathology testing which now accounts for approximately 35% of all revenues. During the quarter, gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continued to grow more rapidly than overall clinical revenues. We had seen double-digit growth in a number of tests. For example, HPV testing increased as we continued to educate physicians about testing guidelines and the benefits of HPV testing in conjunction with lab tests. Vitamin D testing grew more than 50% based on increased awareness in the market and interest among doctors in identifying patients with vitamin D deficiency. Our ImmunoCAP allergy testing grew approximately 20% as doctors increasingly used it to identify allergy and asthma in patients. We have also enhanced service to customers in several ways while driving efficiencies. Now, we are enabling physicians to get faster answers to their most frequently asked questions by adopting self-service technology through the web and interactive voice response technology. This new system is more efficient for our physicians and us. We have improved the ability of patients to pay for their testing in our patient service centers or online, which has further improved cash collections and patient satisfaction. Our specimen tracking initiative is a great example of how we are improving service quality and also enhancing customer service and employee satisfaction. By assigning unique bar codes and using hand-held scanners, we can follow a patient specimen at every step of its journey to the laboratory, eliminating cumbersome manual tracking. The number of uninsured people is increasing due to the recession. We recognize that many patients are facing financial hardships. We offer several programs to assist patients. Our financial assistance program provides free or reduced fee laboratory services. In addition, we are proud to be participating as the official diagnostic testing laboratory for Walgreens Take-Care Recovery plan. We are benefiting today from investments and decisions we made years ago. We believe that awareness drives appropriate utilization of diagnostics to enhance healthcare outcomes and reduce cost. However, we do not create such awareness overnight; it sometimes takes years to give support in the medical community. Take for example our Cardio CRP test; ten years ago, we were the first laboratory to offer high-sensitivity CRP testing working with Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Test volume did not increase immediately, but gradually use of this test has grown. The landmark Jupiter study last November supported broad use of CRP testing to identify people with low LDL cholesterol who may be at high risk for heart attack. In the first quarter, Cardio CRP volume grew about 50% over the prior year. We were one of the pioneers in the use of tender mass spectrometry to meet growing demands for a number of advanced tests including vitamin D, testosterone, and other hormones. Recently, when the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a vitamin D standard reference material to reduce inter-laboratory variability, it used tender mass spec. The Endocrine Society considers tender mass spec to be the new gold standard in the measurement of subnanolytes. Our proprietary Leumeta family of plasma-based leukemia and lymphoma tests continues to grow. Since we introduced the first Leumeta test in 2006, we have expanded the family to include 22 tests. Helping doctors manage patients with blood cancers is one of our goals. To solve this important growth segment, we have built a team of more than 60 board-certified hematopathologists, more than any other laboratory. We are pleased that the American College of Gastroenterology recently updated its guidelines for colorectal cancer detection. Now, it recommends an annual fecal immunochemical test such as our proprietary InSure FIT in conjunction with colonoscopy or as an alternative. We focus on our med needs to identify potential new tests in different disease states and across the spectrum of care, from identifying a patient’s predisposition to disease, to diagnosing a problem, to driving therapy decisions, and monitoring treatment. For instance, there is a significant need for ovarian cancer tests. We are excited about the potential that our HE4 blood test and when used in conjunction with the CA125 biomarker may enable doctors to better identify women at high risk for ovarian cancer. While the combination test still requires FDA action, we are encouraged by a recent study by researchers at Brown University that provides additional support for the use of two biomarkers together. We are working on two new tests for prostate cancer. We licensed a DNA Methylation biomarker for a blood test and are working to develop a urine test utilizing 4 gene markers. Another test with good potential is the new QuantiFERON test for tuberculosis. This new test replaces the 118-year-old skin test and has significant advantages. It reduces false positives, has higher compliance, and does not require patients to return to the physician for the results. We are educating physicians and public health operatives about the benefits and are starting to see results. The interest and demand for companion diagnostics and other personalized medicine is also increasing. To meet the growing need in this area, we have added biomarker capabilities and medical and scientific personnel. While it is still holidays, some of these tests are improving health outcomes. Some examples are K-RAS gene mutation analysis to determine eligibility for therapies such as Erbitrux. Our two new tests to assess candidates for Herceptin therapy and CYP450 mutation analysis to identify patients who may have difficulty metabolizing drugs such as Coumadin and anti-inflammatory agents. We are growing our market presence in healthcare IT. Starting in 2009, physicians using ePrescribing for medications are eligible for a supplemental payment from Medicare. This has resulted in strong increases in uses of our Care360 physicians’ portal for ePrescribing. By the end of the first quarter, ePre users were up 45% from year end. The number of medications ordered through Care360 had grown to the current annual rate of 6.5 million. Care360 laboratory orders and results and ePrescribing create stickiness with physician customers. We are enhancing the patient experience and also making it easier for physicians to practice medicine. Additionally, health information exchanges foster better patient care and improved business performance for healthcare institutions, physicians, and patients. Our MedPlus subsidiary is a leading developer and integrator of data exchange solutions and its technologies driving greater data sharing for HIEs in New York, California, Canada, and New Mexico. The National Debate on healthcare is probably just beginning and we believe that the outcome will be a net positive for our industry. Diagnostic testing is a vital component of the healthcare equation and it will play an even expanded role. It is a growing consensus that keeping people healthy drives better long-term outcomes and reduces costs. That means, identifying diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease only when there are options to avoid painful complications and costly treatment. In closing, we are the leader in our industry and are making investments and taking decisive actions to differentiate ourselves from the competition. We were again recognized by the Fortune Magazine as one of the world’s most admired companies. We drove strong results in the first quarter and are raising our commitment for the full year. We now expect EPS of between $3.65 and $3.75, and we are excited about the opportunities before us. Thank you, we will now take your questions.
Operator:  At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser - UBS.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS:  Congratulations for a solid quarter. A couple of questions, first of all, can you just disclose the current run rate on the cost containment initiative, and then secondly, on a normalized basis very strong volume performance up 1.5%, it could be somewhat surprising given the concern around the potential impact from the economy on a core testing, can you just give us a little bit more color on what you’re seeing in terms of physician offices as an overall trends and do you think that they are sustainable throughout the year?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Let me first comment on the cost reduction program; as we indicated, at the end of last year, when we exit this year, we will have realized $500 million in annualized cost save; that program is progressing very well, and as you heard me say before, what we’re doing there is simplifying processes by re-designing them, streamlining them, and as a result, those are sustainable cost reductions, and that was obviously a significant contributor to what we saw in the first quarter; that along with the revenue mix was a big piece of the increasing margins. In addition though in this first quarter I would say that we were probably a little extra-diligent in managing cost and scrutinizing everything; some of the discrete spending that we had planned for the quarter whether it be meetings, travel, consulting, other programs was either eliminated or deferred, and at least for the first quarter, I think we are in good shape in doing that without having any adverse impact on the business. So, I feel very good about the progress we’re making with the cost reduction program; it’s either on or ahead of plan, and as I said, it’s going to be sustainable cost reduction. With respect to your question about physician office visits, obviously that’s probably what would impact our business more than anything because for the most part as physician office visits grow, that’s how our volume moves. With that said, it’s really hard to assess what the direct impact of the economy is on physician office visits, there’s not real good data out there on that, but our underlying performance in our physician and hospital reference testing business has held up very well and the volumes have been pretty consistent now over the last 3 or 4 quarters. So, I can’t say that we’re seeing any significant impact there, obviously where we have seen impact is in the employer business, the drugs of abuse testing, and to some degree in the risk assessment business as well, but we see no reason to think that there’s going to be a significant change in the experience that we’ve had over the last few quarters.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And just if you can remind us, when should we see the anniversary of the drug of abuse testing?
 : And just if you can remind us, when should we see the anniversary of the drug of abuse testing?
Robert A. Hagemann:  Well, you’re not going to see that until the end of the fourth quarter. It was the fourth quarter where it really started to decline, and it really wasn’t until the end of the fourth quarter that we saw the real significant impact. So, it’s going to be some time late in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of other things though that will anniversary before that; the impact of the lab management contracts I expect to anniversary before that anniversary as we get into the second half of the year, and obviously the number of business days will reverse itself out as we get later into the year as well.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS:  Thanks, that’s helpful.

Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group: You had mentioned that generic, esoteric, and anatomic pathology was 35% of revenues for the first quarter and you mentioned some of the tests that were up double-digit or even more, can you mention what the growth was overall for that category, and then if you could just talk about MedPlus, I know that that’s a growing piece of your business, do you have any quantifiable data and what percentage of physicians are using that and how is that specifically increased?
Laure Park:  On the gene-based and esoteric testing was growing definitely significantly higher than our overall average for the company, and as we’ve seen in the past, keep in mind that’s becoming a very large piece of our business, so you’re no longer going to see in the entire book a double-digit growth, but it continues to grow significantly in excess of the company average. On the MedPlus side, right now, we have over a 140,000 physicians on the Care360 connectivity suite and we’re seeing an increasing percentage of them on the physician portal. The physician portal is an important aspect that will given them the ability to do ePrescribing and other premium services. On the ePrescribing side, we saw an increase of 45% over the end of the year with over 6.5 million prescription run rate now in that business. I would expect to see continued strong growth in the number of physicians using ePrescribing as they look to taking advantage of the Medicare premium that they can get this year for using ePrescribing platforms.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  I think the beauty of MedPlus Care360 physician portal is the combination of laboratory orders and results and ePrescription. A lot of people have EMR, they can do scheduling, they can do billing, and they can do ePrescription, but I think what we are seeing that doctors are using our physician portal to have improved practice because they can know the impact of various medications on therapy.
Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group:  Okay, just lastly on the CapEx, you said $200 for the year, could you talk about what projects that’s going to focus on and can you mention whether or not you made any small lab acquisitions this quarter?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  There were no small lab acquisitions in the quarter; if they were, you would have seen those show up directly in the cash flow statement. So, I think what we do there is pretty apparent. On the CapEx side, there’s nothing you need in there. The way that you should think about our CapEx is, typically about a third of it goes into our IT, about a third of it goes into facilities and related and about a third of it goes into laboratory equipment. I would say at this point the laboratory equipment is probably a little higher than it’s been as a percentage of the total only because the other two areas we’ve been managing I think pretty tightly at this point; but no significant projects in there other than what we had last year which is really the standardization of all of our IT systems that had been billing across the company which will continue for the next several years.

Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.:  Good morning, a very nice quarter; a couple of questions, Surya, could you give us your thoughts on healthcare reform and what it may mean for the labs and your outlook for the physician C6 start?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  First of all, every administration has a desire to deal with the healthcare reform, but for some reason or the other, the healthcare reform becomes #2 and #3, but it does not feel like that with the President Obama’s administration and what really encourages me is that he’s understanding of the role of prevention that’s going to play in healthcare, his desire to really cover the children and the uninsured, and also the integral part of healthcare IT. So, we’ve been talking about for years that the diagnostic testing is important and nothing happens without the test, so in my reading and my impression from listening to people, I think the diagnostic testing is going to play a very important role and we are going to benefit as an industry, but as far as the physician fee schedule, that’s something we don’t know what the final amount is going to be, but we had the increase for the first time, the medical increase, but it looks like there may not be any drastic cuts, but I feel very encouraged about diagnostic industry and about our company, how we have positioned our company to meet the patients’ and the physicians’ needs whether it’s cancer or it’s infectious disease or whether it is cardiovascular disease.
Robert A. Hagemann:  And remember with respect to the fee schedules, the bigger issues with the physician fee schedule is the laboratory fee schedule will be due for an adjustment unless there’s some other change to it.
Laure Park:  Yes, on the physician fee schedule, that’ll be something that we don’t know what the final fix will be, but from everything we’re seeing, they’re not going to let those draconian cuts going to affect.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra:  Right, and the most significant impact is really the laboratory fee schedule as opposed to the physician fee schedule.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.:  That’s helpful, and then two quick questions, in terms of commercial payer contracts that are coming up, I guess CIGNA is the next one in 2010, just want to get your outlook on that, and then Bob, on the uses of free cash flow, you bought back a lot of stock, is that the kind of way we need to think about what you’re going to be doing with your cash flow?
Robert A. Hagemann:  With respect to managed care contracts, most of the big ones are extended through 2010 or beyond. CIGNA actually runs out beyond that, closer to 2012, I believe, it is. So, I think we’re in good shape; I would say, pricey relative to that piece of the business, it’s much more stable than it’s been in quite a while and so we’re feeling pretty good about that. With respect to capital deployment, as you’ve heard us say in the past, the first goal with respect to excess cash is deploy it into growing the business which would be acquisitions, new test development, and the like. When those opportunities don’t exist or aren’t available at the right price, that’s the point which we would deploy it into share repurchases, which is essentially what we’ve done in the past. I would say though that we want to do all that in the context of preserving our investment grade credit rating. So, there will continue to be some further reduction in debt levels as we go throughout the year and at the end of the day probably the very first priority is to make sure we maintain that investment grade credit rating.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Can you give us any additional details on the lab management contracts that have gone; how many were there and why the change in philosophy here? These were good for you at one point, why the change, and are there are any left that you might seek to step away from?
Robert A. Hagemann: Bob, we talked about these a little bit on the last call, these are lab management agreements that come up for renewal periodically and in assessing them they were not meeting the profitability thresholds that we’ve set and as a result did not renew them. If you look at the table and footnote 4, you can see that while it had a pretty significant impact on volume it had a relatively insignificant impact on revenues. So that tells you that they were pretty low priced. They were profitable at one point, but sometimes either the service levels need to change or other things cause those to not be as profitable as we would like, and as a result if we can’t adjust the pricing accordingly, we won’t renew them. Now, do I expect that there are additional contracts like that that are coming up this year; no, I think we’re in pretty good shape relative to the ones that we’ve got at this point. Most of the impact you see showing up in the volume, very little to the revenue, and certainly very little to the profit.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: What’s the strategy on the new Walgreens relationship you announced? Are you guys just nice guys or do you expect the relationship to evolve into something maybe more meaningful economically for you?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Well, first of all, we are nice guys, but we work with a number of retail clinics and this is our way of increasing our channels, and we know that little clinics are going to play an important role in the healthcare delivery system and there is an opportunity to work with Walgreens and I think it’s a great program for Walgreens to provide healthcare support for people who lost their jobs, and we’re going to provide them with free testing for some of those patients.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Is there any cash business between the two of you at the moment?
Laure Park: Yes, Robert, there is, and we actually do provide laboratory services for paying customers into the clinics per minute for Take-Care as well as for Minute clinic.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: It’s all the little clinics.
Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: There’s no esoteric opportunity there, is there?
Laure Park: At this point in time, their services menu is pretty focuses on sick care. There may be some movement as walk in, but right now it’s a very thin menu.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: There are a limited number of tests.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just a couple of followup questions here. Surya, you commented on healthcare reform and where your labs are situated it looks very favorable in terms of helping on the diagnosis for care, but as we think about the physician fee fix and the Obama administration’s focus on preventative care, do you think you can come into a situation where maybe the family physicians, the front liner of the physician community benefits more in the physician fee fix maybe at the expense of higher end specialties and do you think that might have a potential impact on the esoteric mix at all, in terms of the fees, like I said, slightly balancing?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to turn out, but I’ll be very surprised that is going to reduce any significant changes with the specialty because the reality is that as we grow old and the population is growing, there are issues whether it is chronic disease or whether it is acute disease, and so when I think about the healthcare reform, I think the most important thing at the moment is realizing that instead of having episodic care, now we have to take a continuum of care and that is where the diagnostic laboratory, the diagnostic testing is going to be more important. We know the healthcare cost has gone up and for the last 20 years we have miracle drugs and miracle devices and now the question is how diagnostics is going to study the predisposition to a disease, to monitor therapy, and I think that’s going to be across the spectrum of whether it is primary care or whether it is specialists.
Laure Park: Actually if you think about everything that we’re looking at, obviously we need to see exactly where they go as compared to effectiveness, but laboratory testing can help the specialized physician to make decisions more efficiently and effectively as it relates to the overall use of healthcare. Obviously if we think about the cancer areas right now, in-therapy selection and monitoring are great examples.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: I think you feel worried about whether the specialists are only ordering esoteric testing and that might change, you shouldn’t be worried about that because now esoteric testing are also ordered by internists and primary care and what is esoteric today in five years it becomes routine. So, this is the reason why I said that we invested money a long time ago and now we’re now getting the benefit of CRP. We invested money in technologies like mass spec and we’re getting the benefit of vitamin D. We’ll continue doing this, bringing new technology and increasing the quality, and we will have a significant amount of business based on high-quality high-value esoteric testing.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Two followup questions here; the insurance recovery, can we get a little more detail, what’s that related, and I know you said $0.05, that on $8.5 million, does that sound alright then?
Robert A. Hagemann: Charles, I am not sure I can give you a lot of additional color here. We’re expecting to receive an insurance recovery in the second quarter which will give us about a $0.05 EPS benefit, and that’s closer to about $15 million pre-tax. You’re probably doing an after tax number.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yes, I was looking at after tax. So, $15 million or so.
Robert A. Hagemann: Right, and it relates to a claim associated with a storm which occurred a number of years ago. It’s non-recurrent in nature and that’s why we’re breaking it out for you separately.
Laure Park: Footnote 6 has the information; that’s where we placed it on the P&L; in the second quarter, it will be sitting above in operating income.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: The interest expense looks like a tick down, but I look at debt and cash at the end of the period it looks like the debt ticked up a little bit. Is there anything that occurred in the quarter in terms of timing of payments that is related to this or…
Robert A. Hagemann: The debt is actually at the same level that it was at the end of last year.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: I’m sorry, the net cash was, because it looks like you have been buying back stock.
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct. I think you can see that all the way down on the pace of the cash flow statement. It was essentially the share repurchases that reduced the cash balance, but otherwise it was a terrific quarter in terms of operating cash flow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor - Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: I missed a little bit of the Q&A, so just refer me to the transcript if I am repeating something. Have you had any evidence in the 1Q that there was anymore aggressive buy-down by employers with the managed care plans through the last renewal cycle; any noticeable uptick on the copay side?
Robert A. Hagemann: Not that we can see Gary. Certainly, if you look at our billing matrix, they’ve continued to improve, ageings have continued to improve, DSOs are down, bad debt is down. So, I would tell you that I’ve not seen a significant impact here. Usually the first quarter carries a little higher bad debt than the rest of the year does. So, it could be because of copays and deductibles, but I can’t say that we’ve seen any significant uptick in the amount that we’re having to bill patients.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Can you remind us as a percent of revenue copays and deductibles are what?
Robert A. Hagemann: As you think about it it’s probably about 5% to 6% or so and that’s really embedded in what we call third party. So, if you were to look at our 10-K and you look at the revenue by payer there, embedded in third party are the copays and deductibles, and what you see sitting up in patient is really the uninsured that we’re billing directly.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Finally, can you give us the allowance on the gross AR or do we need to wait for the Q?
Laure Park: The Q will be filed later this week as planned today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: A couple of quick guidance things; is there something in the back half of the year that we should be thinking about that gives you confidence in that 3% topline guidance, and just to be clear the 3% revenue is for total company and not just the clinical business?
Robert A. Hagemann: Correct, it’s total company, and Ralph, I guess the best place for you to look would be again in this footnote 4 to the earnings release because there are a number of factors that are impacting the first quarter which are not going to impact the full year to the same extent. Certainly, we talked earlier about the lab management agreements which are going to anniversary, the number of business days, the drugs of abuse testing business won’t anniversary until late in the fourth quarter, and foreign exchange may or may not reverse out, but that’s really not reflective of underlying performance.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: I required this because you’re using 1.3% I guess as the first quarter number; is that right? So it’s implied that the back half is a little bit stronger. Okay, that’s fair. In terms of the raise in guidance; obviously $0.05 was the insurance recovery. Is the balance mainly lower share count just given timing of repurchase so far or is there something else?
Robert A. Hagemann: It’s really improved operating performance. As you think about it we brought the midpoint up by $0.10 and you can think about that as $0.05 from the insurance recovery and $0.05 from operating performance. So, the range that tightened the $0.10, we brought the bottom end up $0.15 and the top end up $0.10.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, so it wasn’t share repurchase that had been factored in when you originally gave it?
Robert A. Hagemann: Share repurchase for the most part is very consistent with the capital plan that we’ve got this year, maybe a little more front-end loaded because of the GSK repurchase, but very much in line with our capital plan for the year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: On the AmeriPath business; I know you’re not breaking that out separately anymore, but can you give us any color on retention efforts with pathologists?
Laure Park: On the enzyme pathology front, our retention efforts on the pathologists are very strong. We have a pathologist team, if you think about a consolidated organization of about 800 pathologists. So, you don’t keep everyone, but our retention efforts are very strong and we’re pleased with that.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, correct me if I’m wrong, but did you lose a case in terms of the non-competes around AmeriPath?
Laure Park: It was related to one state and keep in mind it’s one state and still in dispute.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: The last question, when we think about international expansion, should we consider acquisition or should we just think about it as mainly a build out of current locations and start ups if will, and then if you could just remind us the goal again, was it 10% of revenue, is it in the next five years and you’re currently at 3%, is that right?
Laure Park: International revenue is about 3% growth rate now, but 10% is the multi-year goal and I think it’s safe to tell you that that’s been organic plus a supplement or the strategic acquisitions as they become available.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: We continue to believe that going to international especially for developing countries provides a mid and long-term growth opportunity and our large investments outside the US is at the moment in India and that market is $1.5 billion to $2 billion and it’s growing double digits. We’re making progress in many fronts; we’ve built the laboratories, one of the best laboratories in Asia Pacific and we’ve got CAP and NABL certification and now we’re putting together the plans to acquire customers. So, international is an important strategy and when you look at our other interests of business whether it is clinical trials whether it is HemoCue which is point of care and laboratory and our work in Ireland and UK, those are the things that are really going to grow and our goal is to have 10% revenue in several years.
Robert A. Hagemann: In these markets many of them are much more fragmented than you see here in the US and as we get more familiar with the markets and understand how to operate there make us more comfortable considering acquisitions down the road.
Laure Park: But to put it in perspective, it’s a small piece of the business today; it’s not a short-term drive. It’s really a seed planted for long-term growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: Just a couple of clarifying questions on the last questions around the topline guidance. I am still having a little bit of trouble getting to just keep a ramp now to the 3% guidance for the year. So, if I understood correctly, I believe there’s a comment of the number of business days, that impact essentially gets washed out by the end of the year in the anniversarying effect that we see from the lab management contracts should be worth about 1% impact in the second half of the year. So, I guess my questions are; first, have I got that right, and secondly, is there anything that’s coming online that would make that revenue per acquisition within that range not sustainable through the end of the year, and then finally, are there any key assumptions in that guidance on improvement on volumes or recovery in the economy that we should know about.
Laure Park: That’s a lot of questions.
Robert A. Hagemann: Let me see if I can clarify at least one item that you mentioned about the laboratory management contracts and it was about a 1% impact of volume, it was a lesser impact to revenue growth, and again, that’s all laid out in that footnote 4 in the table there, but in terms of expectations for the economy and the like, we’re not anticipating any significant improvement in the economy which is going to impact our volumes over the course of the remainder of the year, and again, if you look at the underlying growth that we’ve got in our physician and hospital reference testing business, it’s in excess of 3% in the quarter, and we feel pretty good about that being able to continue, and then with the number of these things that we talked about anniversarying, we feel pretty good about our 3% revenue growth estimate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: A very strong quarter here. Just wanted to ask a few questions here. I guess, last quarter you said that the drugs abuse testing business was still profitable even with the decline in volumes; just curious whether that is still the case.
Robert A. Hagemann: Very much so.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: So, it is still profitable. Okay, and then Bob, your last quarter also you’d said that you thought that some of the cost cutting would be more back-end loaded in 2009; I heard your earlier comment about you guys were just extra cautious this quarter, this in terms of managing costs with everything going on, but still you had made the comment back in the Q4 conference call that it would be back-end loaded. So, just trying to think about that now; can you just give us a quick update in terms of what is different or whether we should look for the rest of the cost cutting to be more back-end loaded.
Robert A. Hagemann: Adam, with respect to the comments that we made in Q4, it was not so much that we saw that back-end loaded as we saw it ramping up throughout the year and increasing as the year progresses because as we continue to deploy the initiatives across the businesses, the benefit continues to grow, but as you did hear me say, we were extra diligent in this first quarter making sure that we manage costs pretty tightly and in some cases deferring a few thing. My expectation is that some of those expenditures that we deferred in the first quarter are going to be required to be made and as such we’re not expecting the same benefit that we saw in Q1 in terms of a 2% margin improvement to continue for the rest of the year. Obviously, if we can see clear to permanently removing some of those costs from our cost structure, we will, but that’s not what we’re projected at the moment. The cost reduction program that we’ve been talking about all along is very much on track and a big driver of our performance improvement.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: On the bad debt side you guys have done a great job there and you answered some questions earlier about that, but is it your expectation that we can see that trend continue to get better throughout the year or do you think the trend for Q1 should be seen as in a steady state for the rest of the year.
Robert A. Hagemann: I certainly would love to see it get better in terms of bad debt and DSOs, but I wouldn’t expect any significant improvement in either of those, and as you know, DSOs bounce around a few days from quarter to quarter and bad debt in the first quarter typically is a little higher than we see for the rest of the year because of copays and deductibles, but I am not expecting a significant swing in bad debt or DSOs either way at this point.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Final question; there was this California Medicaid lawsuit that came out about a month ago, just wanted to get any comments there in terms of how you guys are thinking about that and just any additional color.
Laure Park: Adam, we believe our billing practices were entirely appropriate and we plan to vigorously defend ourselves within this case.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: When would you expect any update in terms of getting that…
Laure Park: I am not going to speculate there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: I wanted to go back to the discussion around costs and I know you’re taking lot of work out of the labs so that that should be sitting in a bowl. I wanted to just key in a little bit more to what you’re seeing with regard to supply chain and the opportunity there. Can you just comment a little bit more about the variable cost side, maybe the reagent trends in terms of price increases or savings?
Robert A. Hagemann: We obviously are looking at the entire supply chain and we’re talking to all of our vendors, and it’s not just a matter of trying to beat people up on cost, but work with them to see how we can help reduce their cost of delivery to us and as such we can both benefit from it, but I think we’ve done a nice job in managing the cost of supplies and reagents and the like and certainly that’s been one of the components of the $500 million savings program at that time.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: On the cancer diagnostic comment that you singled out in the press release, I am just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what kind of trends you are seeing there and I guess just a little bit more color, please.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: First of all, there are no single tests which I can really point to you. It is the way we develop our test and the way we provide our services to the clinician who is to provide the solution for cancer patients, and cancer test is getting more and more molecular along with anatomic pathology and clinical pathology. The whole idea of joining AmeriPath with Quest Diagnostics is that we cover whether it is blood cancer or whether it is skin cancer. So, just to give you some indication like HPV, of course, is growing. The whole molecular diagnostics and anatomic pathology tissue study together is increasing revenue for acquisitions, and there are a number of companion diagnostics, that’s also growing. So, you need just one particular test and we’re very pleased that we have this group of pathologists and a group of tests, whether it is genetic testing or whether it is tissue testing which is really helping us to improve our revenue for acquisitions, but the most important area also which is growing is hematopathology. So, our Leumeta family of tests, that’s proprietary, and we have also cytology growing, and flow cytometry also growing.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: Two more quick ones for Bob; just in terms of the investment you’ve made in India, you’ve commented before what that run rate has been on the earnings per share; can you comment on that, maybe just give us a high-level comment on the management team in India; how long has that team been in place and together at this point?
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Let me first talk a little bit about what we’re doing in India and Bob can talk about the investment. We decided to build a state-of-the-art laboratory in India to provide high-quality esoteric testing to not only India, but also become the Asia Pacific laboratory for clinical trials and also testing for specialty physicians. Now, we have changed a couple of management because as we develop and as we grow we are seeing whether people meet our requirements or not, and I am very happy with the current change in the management and we now have a group of people who are not only looking at high-quality operations, but also focusing on customers.
Robert A. Hagemann: Gary, the investment that we expect to make in India this year is not significantly different than what we made last year. If you recall, it was rather modest, about a penny a quarter, and obviously anytime you enter a new market, you expect to make an investment upfront in order to realize gains in the future, and I think we’ve been very diligent in managing that investment until we get to the point where that business breaks even.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities: My last question with regard to your borrowings, obviously you can elect various LIBOR fixings; where are you on the LIBOR curve at this point and I guess going into the second quarter, I am assuming you’re on the shorter end with most of your bonds. Can you just confirm that?
Robert A. Hagemann: We are on the shorter end at the moment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Quirk - Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Just a couple of wrap-ups here; first off, Surya, basing your comments on vitamin D, it sounds to me like you’re still using the internally validated assay; I assume that you’re obviously pleased with the corrections that you guys have taken.
Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra: Yes, and one of the things that I always tell people that you’d expect from our company as a Six Sigma company that we will continuously evaluate technology, we’ll continuously evaluate quality, and I am very pleased with we invested money in the long-term on mass spec and we’re very pleased with the demand that we see in vitamin D and we’re actually gearing up to meet that demand in the marketplace.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: You’ve only backed up the benefit of the lab fee schedule, does the correct revenue pre rec increase nicely here in the quarter. I guess I am just trying to think about the sustainability of this vis-à-vis what appears to be anyway an incremental push if you will on the esoteric side; any color here would be great.
Robert A. Hagemann: Again, I hate referring people back to this footnote in 4, but there is a table there that reconciles some of the big drivers of that 4.1% and as you can see 1.7% of it is really due to mix, the drugs of abuse testing, and the lab management agreements producing less volume which carried lower reimbursement than the average, but when you adjust for that, we’re around 2.5% or so which is pretty consistent with what we’ve been seeing, and it’s not just esoteric testing, it’s additional test per rec being ordered during encounters, and that could be routine testing as well as esoteric testing, but we do feel pretty good about that being sustainable.

A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later this morning in the Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. Additionally we have posted a power point presentation and a spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis on the website.  Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you Laure, we delivered another quarter of solid performance completing a year of strong revenue and earnings growth. During the fourth quarter earnings per share increased 10% to $0.87, revenues increased to $1.8 billion, and cash flow increased to $363 million.  For the full year the earnings per share increased 14% to $3.23, revenues increased 8% to $7.2 billion and cash flow exceeded $1 billion.  I am pleased with our continued progress. We are able to exceed our commitment for earnings growth in 2008 despite the current economic environment. The fourth quarter and full year results represent outstanding performance. We are in a recession while the rate of our growth could temporarily slow as a result of external economic factors, we expect continued growth in revenues and earnings.  To the extent that economic impact is more severe then we anticipate, we are also prepared to take actions necessary to further adjust our cost structure. For 2009 we expect revenues to grow approximately 3% approaching $7.5 billion and earnings per share to grow 8% to 15% to between $3.50 and $3.70.  Also our dividend policy remains unchanged and our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million for future share buybacks demonstrating confidence in our performance and commitment to increasing shareholder value. In any economic environment diagnostic testing is an essential healthcare service. As the industry leader we are well positioned to benefit from a range of future opportunities and diagnostic testing becomes evermore important within the healthcare world.  The opportunities include the following, the demographics of the growing and ageing populace are a positive for our industry and our company. As people age they require more testing and we are seeing an increasing number of tests ordered for each patient.  The advent of personalized medicine enables targeted tests to help doctors guide assistance and therapy and monitor their effectiveness of treatment. The pace of innovation in this important area is accelerating with the frequent development of new biomarkers. Expanding access to screening tests for wellness and early detection of disease for the healthcare theme during the Presidential election and it remains a stated objective of the Obama administration. Diagnostic testing is a large and still fragmented industry. We are the industry leader but we have only 15% of the market leaving plenty of room to grow. In 2009 we will grow revenues largely by driving increased sales of [inaudible] tests particularly cancer diagnostics, for physicians and hospitals. We will grow earnings through top line growth combined with further improvements in operating efficiencies.  I will give you a brief summary of our progress after you hear from Robert on the analysis of our fourth quarter results. 
Robert Hagemann: Thanks Surya, as you heard our business is strong and performing well. Despite challenging economic conditions, revenues, earnings and cash flow have all grown and we remain confident in our prospects for continued growth.  Turning to results for the fourth quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.87, 10% above the prior year with the increase principally driven by strong operating performance. This brings full year EPS to $3.23, an increase of 14% from the prior year.  In the quarter we recorded a charge of about $16 million primarily associated with workforce reductions which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. This $0.05 was fully offset by the favorable resolution of several tax contingencies which increased earnings per share by $0.05. During the quarter costs incurred related to the continued development and deployment of standard systems were approximately $0.02 per share and start-up costs for our India operation were $0.01 bringing the full year amounts to approximately $0.11 and $0.04 respectively.  Revenues were $1.8 billion, 1.7% above the prior year. Revenues for our clinical testing business which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues were 2.3% above the prior year and about 3% above before the impact of our pre employment drug testing business.  Volume was 40 basis points below the prior year driven by a 16% decline in drug testing volumes. Before the impact of drug testing volumes grew about 1% inline with the rate through the first three quarters.  Our drug testing business and our risk assessment business which serves life insurers are our two businesses most subject to a slowing economy. Combined they account for less then 10% of our total revenues and both tend to be lower priced business. Therefore their impact on revenues and profitability tends to be less significant. We have taken, and will continue to take, if necessary, aggressive actions to manage the costs of these businesses in order to mitigate their impact to our earnings growth. Revenue per requisition increased 2.8%, with the increase continuing to be primarily driven by a positive mix, and is generally in line with what we saw through the first three quarters. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.6% for the fourth quarter, and reflects continued improvement, despite a reduction of almost a full percent associated with the $16 million charge discussed earlier.  Before the impact of the charge, operating income as a percentage of revenues is up almost one percent versus the prior year, principally due to revenue growth and the progress we are making with our cost reduction program. That program, which we committed would reduce our cost structure by $500 million is on track and has now delivered over $300 million in annualized savings, with the balance expected in 2009. We are making good progress across all elements of the program, particularly in billing and collections, where we continue to see excellent performance in bad debt, days sales outstanding and the cost of our billing operation. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.3%, 10 basis points improved from the third quarter and the prior year. DSOs were reduced to 44 days, down from 45 days at the end of Q3 and 48 days at the end of last year. With our disciplined approach we expect to see continued strong performance in our billing and collection metrics, despite a slowing economy.  Our cash flow continued to be outstanding. Cash from operations increased to $363 million for the  quarter, compared to $355 million last year. During the quarter we fully utilized our remaining share repurchase authorization, and repurchased 5.5 million shares at an average price of $46 for a total of $254 million. Scheduled debt repayments were $45 million, and capital expenditures were $73 million in the quarter.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $254 million at quarter-end. In addition during the quarter we successfully replaced the expiring $125 million portion of our receivables credit facility with a new $225 million facility, bringing the total receivables facility to $500 million. This, coupled with the $750 million available under our revolving credit facility, brings our unused credit lines to $1.3 billion and positions us extremely well from a liquidity standpoint. Consistent with our positive outlook, and in order to provide us with multiple options and continued flexibility to deploy excess cash, our Board has authorized an additional $500 million of share repurchases. There is no specific timeframe over which the additional share repurchase authority will be utilized.  Throughout 2009 we will remain prudent and generally conservative in how we deploy our capital, with excess cash used to retire debt, invest in growth, and repurchase shares. Now, let’s turn to our 2009 outlook for continuing operations, we expect revenue growth to be approximately 3%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to approach 18%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $1 billion, before the expected payment of the $316 million reserve established for NID, or approximately $700 million after such payment. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $200 million. And lastly, we expect diluted earnings per share to be between $3.50 and $3.70, excluding potential special charges. As we discussed last quarter, these are challenging economic times, and no company is totally immune. Yet we have continued to consistently deliver strong operating performance, and are confident in our ability to deliver further improvement. The investments which we have made provide us with unmatched assets and capabilities. Our program to reduce costs is well underway and has excellent momentum. And our strong financial condition, cash flow, and investment grade credit rating provide us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities more freely than others.  Clearly we are positioned to not only weather this difficult economic climate, but to further strengthen our competitive position. Now I’ll turn it back to Surya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Robert, 2008 was a year of significant achievements. We made progress in executing our plans and differentiating ourselves from the competition. The factors that clearly differentiate us and drive growth include our superior patient experience, Six Sigma quality, innovative science and medicine, unparalleled assets and capabilities and expansion into new markets and geographies. Here are some examples of our progress. We continue to empower patients through expanded use of appointment scheduling and Google Health, which enables patients to take control of their own health information. We used lean Six Sigma to drive efficiencies and further reduce our cost structure. During the year our productivity improved more than 5% within certain areas of our labs. And we launched an advanced tracking system so we can identify the location of a specimen en route to our laboratory. We have been diversifying our business to higher value esoteric, gene-based, and anatomic pathology testing, which now account for 36% of all revenues. In 2008 gene-based, esoteric, and anatomic pathology revenues increased 20%.  Our medical and scientific staff of 800 MDs and 100 Ph.D.s is unmatched. Many of these people are internationally recognized experts in their specialty, from dermatopathology to anatomic pathology, from cardiac to cancer diagnostics and from infectious to genetic diseases. Our doctors diagnose more patients a day than some hospitals do in months. We are the leading provider of cancer diagnostics, offering physicians and their patients access to the most complex molecular tests, the finest anatomic pathologists and leading histology and cytology services. We are expanding our pipeline of innovation. We nearly doubled the number of assays in our Leumeta family of plasma-based Leukemia and lymphoma tests to 22. We introduced the new FDA-cleared HE-4 blood test for ovarian cancer recurrence, and we are the only national reference lab to offer it. We introduced a gene-based test to determine an individual’s risk of age-related macular degeneration, a common form of visual impairment. We are developing a blood test for colorectal cancer based on the Septin 9 DNA methylation biomarker. This innovative test will be a supplement to conventional methods of colorectal cancer screening. We are developing companion diagnostics for new therapies that will enable personalized treatment. We recently acquired additional biomarker capabilities to advance our efforts in this area. We introduced K-RAS genetic analysis to determine which patients with metastatic colorectal or lung cancer would benefit from targeted therapy. When it comes to HCIT, healthcare IT, we added 15,000 physician users to Care360, bringing the total to 140,000 doctors. This enables them to order lab tests, prescribe drugs, and share clinical information with other healthcare providers quickly and securely. The number of medications ordered through Care360 more than doubled to an annual rate of 4.5 million. We are expanding into new markets and geographies to provide longer-term growth opportunities. We launched our HemoCue CLIA-waived MicroAlbumin Point of Care test in the US and a white blood cell testing platform in Europe. We became one of the few laboratories in India to receive triple accreditation from CAP, NABL and NGSP. In Ireland, we have significantly reduced the waiting time for Pap tests for women through a contract with the Irish government. In summary we are the clear leader in an attractive industry that provides an important and essential healthcare service. No company is immune to economic challenges, but we believe the opportunities before us far outweigh the challenges. We are differentiating ourselves from our competitors through our superior patient-centric service, Six Sigma quality, science and innovation, and our unparalleled assets and capabilities. We are bifocal, doing what is right for the business in the short-term and planning for the long-term. Our company remains strong operationally and financially. This enables us to execute our strategy without distraction through the current economic environment and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future. We expect revenue growth of about 3% and EPS growth of between 8% and 15% in 2009. And, we remain committed to driving superior returns for shareholders. Thank you. We will now take your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy - William Blair 
Amanda Murphy - William Blair : Regarding 2009 guidance, in terms of volume growth I know you probably don’t want to guide specifically but can you help us think about how volumes have trended, maybe in 2008 in the core business, so ex drugs of abuse, are you seeing a slowdown in test for rec or lower physician office visits and then how does that extrapolate into next year.
Robert Hagemann: As I said in the prepared remarks when you adjust for the drugs of abuse testing business which obviously is most impacted by the economy, we’ve seen about 1% growth in each of the first three quarters in our underlying physician and hospital reference testing business. And although we’re not giving guidance in terms of revenue per rec and volume for 2009, we tend to give it in just terms of total revenues, we’re not expecting a dramatic change in that.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair : So when you are thinking about the economic environment were you assuming status quo or did you anticipate some worsening or how did that work.
Robert Hagemann: I think like everybody else, its really difficult to estimate when the economy might reach bottom and how quickly it will rebound but as we’ve said while we might be impacted somewhat in terms of the physician office visits or volume, we’ve not been significantly impacted and I think you can see that in our results through all four quarters of the year where underlying volume was steady at about 1%. 
Amanda Murphy - William Blair : In terms of share repurchases and acquisitions did you include those in the guidance or would that be incremental?
Robert Hagemann: No, our EPS guidance is always all in so whether we’re doing share repurchases, acquisitions or debt repayments, you should consider that reflected in our EPS guidance. While its all in for EPS guidance, our revenue growth is organic revenue growth and not anticipating acquisitions. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda – Leerink Swan 
Jason Gurda – Leerink Swan : Can you give us an update on what’s going on with the Ameripath business and how the integration of the sales effort is going there?
Surya Mohapatra: Well Ameripath is now fully integrated into the company and the specialty partners in the hospital and we see growth in our outpatient anatomic pathology and dermatopathology and there is a slowness in the inpatient but it is fully integrated in the company and we are not separately [inaudible]. 
Jason Gurda – Leerink Swan: I just meant from, are sales acceleration pretty much where you expected it to be.
Surya Mohapatra: As I had said last quarter we are doing some cross selling and we are in the early stage of how to sell to the primary care doctors and we feel that that will help us grow the anatomic pathology business but we are in the early stages of integrating both the cross selling activities. 
Jason Gurda – Leerink Swan: On the numbers that you reported for the quarter, your cost of goods sold was down pretty significantly sequentially and just to clarify, the charge the $16 million charge, what line item was that expense recognized in?
Robert Hagemann: That was probably split almost evenly between cost of sales and SG&A with about a half a percent impact in each of them. 
Jason Gurda – Leerink Swan: Just looking at the overall cost structure since it is down so significantly, its definitely a sign of your cost cutting program, but is there anything unusual in the quarter or should we assume that this is pretty much the run rate going forward except for some seasonal difference.
Robert Hagemann: Again, I’d caution you to take the percentages in any one quarter and try and extrapolate them through the year. As we’ve done since the beginning of the year we’ve been very, very deliberate in the way we’ve managed cost and as we’ve mentioned, the cost reduction program which we’ve launched well over a year ago now has very good momentum and we feel very good about what that’s delivering and what it will continue to deliver in 2009. I think when you look at the guidance that we put out there for 2009 we are expecting to expand the margins further beyond what we’ve got this year but yes, I want to caution you to try, in taking one quarter, and extrapolating that to the full year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser - UBS 
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS:  On the volume side, obviously throughout 2008 volumes were positive if we exclude drug abuse, what other trends are you seeing January to date, I know its early in the year, but just curious to know that.
Robert Hagemann: We don’t comment specifically on any one month but obviously what we’re seeing in January has been built into our outlook for 2009.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And is it overall similar to what you’ve seen throughout 2008?
Robert Hagemann: As I told you we don’t comment on a specific month particularly a two-week period. Its really tough to try and interpret too much from that. 
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And then as far as the investment in IT in the India expenditure included in guidance and also what’s the bad debt as a percent is embedded in guidance. 
Robert Hagemann: We haven’t given specific guidance on the amount of the investment in India or the investment in systems for 2009 but you should expect that they’re not going to be significantly different in the amount of investment that we had in India this year, was about $0.04 a share. We’re closely managing that to make sure that we don’t get too far ahead of the ramp up in revenues there. 
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And as far as the debt expense?
Robert Hagemann: Bad debt expense, obviously again we don’t give specific guidance on that but we don’t see any reason for it to be significantly different then it was this year. We continue to see opportunities there to improve our processes, work more closely with payers, etc. and we’re continuing to work those opportunities and those are the things that have allowed us to continue reducing bad debt and DSO’s over the course of this year despite the fact that the economy has been slow. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital 
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital:  With the drugs of abuse testing did you give a percent decline for revenues for that business the way you have in prior quarters?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, that business, the volumes were down about 16% in the quarter so that was an acceleration of what we had seen in the earlier part of the year where it was down 10% or so and if you look at the table that we have, footnote six, to the earnings release, you see that the revenue impact in the quarter was about 0.50%. 
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Last quarter you highlighted that even with the decline in volumes in that business you still saw margins go up in that business because of cost cutting did you see a similar trend here?
Robert Hagemann: We did not see them go up this quarter but I will tell you that that business and the risk assessment business as a result of the things we’ve done to manage the cost structure continue to be profitable businesses for us. 
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Just thinking the impact just from the economy and such, just trying to better understand trends, are you seeing any significant differences in different regions, just curious in terms of just trends as you look at your business on a regional basis. 
Robert Hagemann: We don’t typically comment on how our business is performing region by region. But what I can tell you is generally we’ve not seen dramatic differences across the company in what’s happening as a result of the economy. 
Surya Mohapatra: You know in any economic environment diagnostic testing remains an essential service and with the Obama administration’s emphasis on expanded coverage and wellness, I think that diagnostic industry is going to do better then some other industry in this slowdown. So we are projecting that we will grow 3%, more or less in line with the market and, but our earnings is going to grow because we’re going to grow some on top line and also by reducing our costs and improving our efficiencies. 
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: And the managed care contracting, it seems like the environment is definitely much better then it was a couple of years ago, we’ve seen pricing improve, so as you look at the contract renewals in 2009 any major ones as you’re thinking about it, and was there any impact in the fourth quarter from annualizing any prior contracts?
Robert Hagemann: There was no significant impact in the fourth quarter of any [annualization] of new contracts and as you know over the course of the last year plus, all of our major managed care contracts have either been renewed or expanded with most of those into 2010 or beyond. So the pricing on those is set and should be very clear to us over the course of that time.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: As we think about the inflationary updates, does the reduction in CPI have any impact on you as you build in inflationary updates in the contracts?
Robert Hagemann: Not in the contracts so much. We don’t have a lot of contracts that are pegged to CPI or medical CPI’s. In some cases we do obviously, in other cases we have set fee increases and in some we have further discounts for increased volumes. So its kind of all across the board but nothing significant as a result of what the CPI might be doing.
Laure Park: Medicare fee schedule is one that is CPI based and that’s based on CPI as of June 30 so obviously what happens here could impact the next CPI adjusted—
Robert Hagemann: Right, but for 2009 that’s set. We know that and that’s going to contribute about a half a point to our revenue growth in 2009. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank  
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank :  Regarding the buyback and wanted to hear from you about how the Board contemplated that buyback in comparison to perhaps and enhanced yield with the dividend policy and if you could just talk a bit about the thought process there.
Robert Hagemann: As you know, we’ve been paying a dividend now for some time and its been what I would characterize as a relatively modest dividend and the principal way that we have looked to drive shareholder value at this company is by growing earnings and a lot of that has been as a result of us continuing to invest the cash flow that we have, in growth whether it be acquisitions or other opportunities for growth and when those opportunities weren’t readily available at reasonable prices, you saw us deploy excess cash into share repurchases to drive shareholder returns. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the Board has now provided us again with the flexibility to deploy cash into multiple areas since we had used up the previous share repurchase authority, we restored that and now have the ability to not only pay down debt but repurchase shares and continue to invest in growth. Yes, I think you need to be somewhat opportunistic here. We’re going to have as a priority in 2009 certainly some further debt reduction and after that really when you think about the priorities for cash it would first be growth, and then share repurchases. 
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank : Regarding the cost structure, you’ve restated your goal of $500 million by the end of 2009, with the remaining $200 million I guess that’s left if you’ve taken $300 million out thus far, could you just talk a bit more about the various buckets that you’ve previously described and where you see the cost opportunities being in 2009.
Robert Hagemann: Its going to be very much a continuation of what we’ve done over the course of the last year plus. The opportunities continue to be in our laboratory, in our logistics, in our billing areas. This about where the cost resides and the way we’re going about this is such where we believe these are going to be sustainable cost reductions because we are reorganizing processes, we’re using lean Six Sigma to actually take work out of the system. We’re not just asking people to do more with less, we’re actually reducing work here.  And its not only reducing costs for us but as you reduce the effort that complete a process you simplify the process, you also improve your quality along the way and that’s essentially what we’ve been doing over the course of the last year and a half. Pretty much the same thing will continue in 2009 and in each of the areas where we’re expecting further savings, we’ve already go very good momentum. 
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank : In the lab, is there any productivity gain goal or target that you may have 2009 over 2008.
Robert Hagemann: Absolutely in every laboratory and every department within a laboratory, we have productivity targets that we’ve established. 
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank : I mean in the aggregate, if you just maybe share with us what—
Robert Hagemann: I’m not prepared to do that right now.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor - Citigroup 
Gary Taylor - Citigroup:  On the incremental cost savings here anticipated in 2009, should we be modeling that ratably, is there any lumpiness to that through the year?
Robert Hagemann: Generally no, as I said we’re already well underway with this program and it will continue pretty much at the same pace that we’ve got it running now so there’s not lumpiness necessarily in those savings. Now that doesn’t mean that as you think about our performance quarter to quarter that its going to be exactly the same. There are a number of things either timing wise from a revenue perspective, or from a cost perspective, seasonality principally that caused the quarters to be a little different from each other. 
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: On the $8.8 million investment charge or impairment, did you describe what that was for?
Robert Hagemann: That was Q3, that was an investment that we had, that we were required to write down as a result of the accounting rules, non-cash charge. But that was Q3. 
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Finally, my question is about your vitamin D program, The New York Times was writing about some issues you’ve had with that testing, some letters you’ve had to send out to docs, so one what’s happened to your vitamin D volumes and secondly how are you managing any PR impact there might be in the pathologist community.
Surya Mohapatra: Well let me first take the question about quality, we practice Six Sigma and we strive for perfection so obviously we’re not happy when we see a quality suit. But when we found that there is some quality issue we investigated it, we fixed it, and we informed the people. We did less then 7% of people were affected and what a good company, a Six Sigma company does.  So we did that in October and in many instances we got good response and good feedback from the health plans and also the doctors about our process and you know, sometimes these kind of activities even build creditability.  As far as reduction in volume or losing customers we have not seen anything significantly, in fact I haven’t seen anything which modestly even and vitamin D continues to grow. But it is very important to know that a company who practices Six Sigma, this is the right culture for the employees to do, to find the mistake, to self-report, to fix it, and then let all the people know. So I’m pretty proud actually of the process we went through and I don’t see there is any significant impact on our PR.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Just going back to the $8.8 million, it was in the other expense net?
Robert Hagemann: In the third quarter, yes. 
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: I’m looking at three months ended 12/31/08 but I’ll follow-up off line.
Robert Hagemann: Are you asking what’s in there now?
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yes.
Robert Hagemann: Okay just to be clear the investment loss was in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter what’s really driving the variance in that line versus the prior year are the losses associated with our deferred compensation plan, those assets get marked to market and that’s what’s in there.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co. 
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.:  Would you mind explaining maybe what the difference is between the low end of your guidance on the earnings per share number and the high end, what’s the delta there that would cause that swing?
Robert Hagemann: Principally revenue growth. 
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Are there any acquisitions out there, with the economy sort of declining I didn’t know whether there might be some things that are opening up for you that you’ve been keeping your eye on but could you kind of talk about what the acquisition environment looks like and what you might be thinking about?
Surya Mohapatra: Well first of all like Robert said, we are in a good position to have enough liquidity and enough cash flow and the first thing we look at is the growth and if we can get some acquisitions which is a reasonable price to improve our business, we’ll do that.  But what we’re not going to do is to acquire something to boost or revenue or earnings if it doesn’t have the appropriate value. We monitor what is available and we have a very active program of looking at acquisitions both from capability and from growth point of view and when it comes to fruition and at appropriate value we will do it. 
Robert Hagemann: I think some of the sellers still have a little bit to go in terms of adjusting their expectations for value. 
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Just in terms of the point of care business, any sort of update on that and then on the government front, I know you touched on this, what should we be looking for there that would be possibly an opportunity for you or something that you might be concerned about. 
Surya Mohapatra: Well first of all we really believe that the point of care and new patient testing is the way to go and as you know last year we introduced the MicroAlbumin and that’s selling. We were expecting to get the clear waiver on white blood cell device which is really a growth driver and has been delayed but I think that’s the trigger point which you look at when we get the approval of the white blood cell, it will accelerate the point of care, our [inaudible] business.  Now having said that we have a number of point of care innovations in the pipeline over the next two or three years so we are going to add to that business as we go forward. 
Laure Park: And were you also asking about our costs were on the government side? Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co. Yes, sort of your outlook, I know you’re talking about it favorably from wellness testing and things like that but is there anything else that we should be thinking about there?
Laure Park: When we look at what’s sitting out there in the landscape, obviously the expanded access at [shipping] so the pieces there are positive, more people who have coverage is always positive as it relates to access to care, the other things that we see for positive trends are obviously the discussion around healthcare information technology. We think successful and appropriate utilization of that is important and its good to see the discussion around that including potentially in the stimulus package as well as wellness prevention and expanded evidence-based medicine protocols which we think are all positive for us.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities 
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities:  Can you comment on what you did do in the fourth quarter from an acquisition standpoint and any deals that you’ve done to date.
Robert Hagemann: In the fourth quarter there was a very small deal that was done and you can see it in the change in the cash flow statement, where we acquired some biomarker capabilities, but that was it in the quarter.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: And nothing to date, nothing this quarter?
Robert Hagemann: No.  
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Going back to sort of the margins, can you talk a bit more about the leverage and the model in the face of declining or decelerating volume trends and sort of put that in the context of the cost savings plan if you could, in other words should we think that this business in the face of declining volumes should see some margin deterioration but your ability to circumvent that is largely related to your cost savings plan, is that the way to think about it?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, I think that’s fair. Any business in the face of declining volumes is going to have pressure on their margins, right. That’s pretty straightforward but if you look at what we’ve done, we’ve been pulling some of the fixed costs out or some of the, even the variable costs have gotten adjusted as we’ve gone through this cost reduction program and that’s what’s caused us to be able to expand margins even in the fourth quarter when revenues grew 1.7%. We had very strong margin expansion versus the prior year when you adjust for that charge that we took for workforce reductions. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: In terms of the, I think you talked about a focus on the esoteric business, how does that differ from previous years if at all, and is that more just mainly a function of the economy.
Surya Mohapatra: No, I think first of all we have been focusing on bringing new products and services to the market and over the last two years we have introduced a number of gene-based testing, we grew Ameripath now we are the leading cancer diagnostics company so 36% of our revenue now in gene-based esoteric anatomic pathology and now with that product and offering we are focusing through the sales channel to get those services to our doctors to benefit the patients. So we think even though the economy is slow that there will be demand for these kinds of tests to solve patients’ problems. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: In terms of going back again to the acquisition side, you seeing anything more in the hospital outreach side just given the challenges in the hospital industry?
Robert Hagemann: Yes, I think that’s certainly an opportunity that we might have going forward. Hospitals I think are continuing to look for ways to raise capital and certainly looking at whether or not they could sell and outreach business is an opportunity to do that. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: CapEx was a little bit lower then previous years, anything going on there that we should be thinking about?
Robert Hagemann: No, just very prudently managing the capital that we’re spending there. Just like everybody else, we’re watching every dollar that we spend and making sure that its spent on the most productive things that we can possibly spend it on and the other thing I would point out is if you look back over the years, we’ve heavily invested in this business so for us to ratchet back a little bit now in terms of capital spending, we can do that without impacting our business or its prospects and feel very good about that.  So we’re not starving the business even though we’re ratcheting back capital a little bit. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffrey 
Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffrey : I just wanted to go back to the margins, if we look at the year-over-year improvement in cost testing services, how much of this would you say is mix versus the impact from the cost savings program?
Robert Hagemann: That’s tough to split out. Certainly mix helps us because it’s the higher margin business that you’re selling there and certainly the cost reduction program is helping us but its tough to split those two out but they’re certainly both contributing to it. 
Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffrey : So there wouldn’t be any one-time impact in there, presumably mix and rather the shift to esoteric testing is something that’s obviously been going on for many, many years.
Robert Hagemann: Again the one-time that’s in there is actually a negative which is the impact of the reduction in force which is around half a point or so. 
Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffrey : As we think about the 2009 growth and specifically you called out oncology in terms of one of the drivers should we be thinking about established testing franchises here akin to HPV or is this going to be perhaps more weighted towards some of the more recent tests you brought out, KRAS for example.
Surya Mohapatra: Its all in there, some of the tests which are already established whether its HPV, or whether it is gonorrhea and Chlamydia and all those things, they’re all growing. But also we have now a portfolio of tests to solve whether it is ovarian cancer recurrence or whether it is cancer of unknown origin or whether it is looking at [inaudible] the tumor cells, whether the therapy is working or not.  So when you look at the tests, not only we have the tests for diagnosis, but also now we have test for monitoring therapy and the whole idea of having Ameripath and Quest Diagnostics together is to really solve the cancer patients and as you know, unfortunately the prevalence of cancer is growing and the good thing is that the tests can give people testing and therapy and better outcome. 
Robert Hagemann: And as these new tests ramp up generally they are ramping up over several years. Its not all in one year and then you have to look for something else to replace the growth. These are typically ramping up over several years and contributing to accelerated growth over an extended period. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of [Shelly Noll] – Goldman Sachs  
[Shelly Noll] – Goldman Sachs :  As we look at the overall volume growth for 2008 can you break out for us how routine testing faired versus esoteric testing?
Laure Park: As you would expect the routine testing grew at a slower rate then our gene-based esoteric and anatomic pathology on an overall basis so and that’s as you would expect and as we’d anticipate going forward. 
[Shelly Noll] – Goldman Sachs : On the CapEx guidance can you give us some way to think about a short-term maintenance CapEx number or a percent of revenue.
Robert Hagemann: As I’ve said in the past, I believe that replacement capital in this business is between 2% and 3% of revenues and if you go back several years we were spending at the rate of about 4% as we were making some pretty heavy investments in technology and a number of other things. This past year we were right at about 3% of revenues and next year we’re projecting in that range as well. 
[Shelly Noll] – Goldman Sachs : On the NID settlement, it looks like we’ve seen a modest tweak up $2 million, is there anything that you can update us with there?
Robert Hagemann: That’s the accrued interest on that payment, and that’s why we’ve added it to the reserve. But nothing else has changed relative to that. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments.  Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostic’s fourth quarter conference call.

A copy of ourearnings press release is available, andthe text of our prepared remarks willbe available later today in the "quarterlyupdates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com.A downloadable spreadsheet with our resultsand supplement analysis are also availableon the website. Now here is SuryaMohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Laurie. Wedelivered another strong quarter of growthand cost reductions. Our growth was basedon improvements across the board in esoteric,gene-based and routine testing. We alsomade progress with our cost reductionprogram. I'm pleased with our progress. During the quarter,revenues grew 3.4% to $1.8 billion, adjustedearnings per share increased 12% and cashflow improved to $329 million. For thefull year 2008, we have raised guidancefor adjusted earnings per share to between$3.17 and $3.22. Let me take amoment to give you our view withrespect to the diagnostics industry andin particular to our company, in lightof the current economic environment. There is generalagreement that we are in a recessionand facing difficult economic conditions. Whilethe rate of our growth may temporarilyslow, diagnostic testing is a criticalhealthcare service and we expect continuedgrowth in revenues and earnings. Remember that almostnothing happens in patient care withouta lab test. We provide important andessential information that influences more than70% of healthcare decisions. The demographicsof the growing and aging population arepositive for our industry and our company.We are seeing the number of testsordered for each patient increase. The rapid advancesin science, medicine and Information Technologyare bringing new and innovative teststo market quickly to diagnose diseaseand monitor therapy at an earlier stage.This is accelerating adoption of manygene-based and esoteric tests and helpingmillions of patients. Anatomic Pathology andmolecular diagnostics are critical to cancercare and increasing reliance on thesetests has reduced morbidity and mortality. Healthcare reform ison the agendas of both the presidentialcandidates. Both candidates have indicated theneed to promote wellness and preventionrather than simply treating the sick.Employers, too, have recognized the importanceof helping their employees to become healthierand maintain their wellness. Laboratory testingis as critical for wellness as itis for treating illness. As a result, webelieve that our growth rate will remainpositive and that we have an opportunityto grow our revenues and increase ourmarket share. Diagnostic testing is alarge and fragmented industry. We onlyhave 15 % of the market, leavingplenty of room for our growth. Over the years, wehave invested in building unique productsand services. Some competitors may findit difficult to compete in a downeconomy. And, many hospitals may preferto partner with us to manage theirlabs to reduce their need for additionalcapital. Diagnostic testing remainsan attractive segment of healthcare industry.And we are well positioned to takeadvantage of growth opportunities. I willgive you a brief progress report onour commitments and future growth initiativesafter you hear the analysis of ourthird quarter results from Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: ThanksSurya. As you heard, our business isstrong and performing well. Its revenuesand earnings have continued to grow, andit has displayed outstanding cash flowcharacteristics. Before I take youthrough the numbers, a quick update regardingNID. After lengthy discussions, we arepleased to report an agreement in principlewith the federal government in connectionwith its investigation. While there arestill details to be negotiated and definitiveagreements to be executed, the detailswhich we can share with you areincluded in footnote 6 to the earningsrelease. As a result ofthis agreement, we have increased ourreserves related to NID by $73 million,through a charge recorded in discontinuedoperations, bringing the total reserves to$314 million. The timing of any paymentsagainst the reserve will be addressedas part of the definitive settlement agreements.We are pleased to have reached agreementon the most important elements of thismatter. Now, let's turn tothe results for the third quarter. Revenueswere $1.8 billion, 3.4% above the prioryear, and about 4% above before theimpact of hurricanes which adversely impactedour revenues and volumes in the quarter.Revenues for our clinical testing business,which account for over 90% of ourtotal revenues, were 3% above the prior year, and about3.5% above before the hurricanes' impact. The AmeriPath acquisitionanniversaried in the second quarter, andis no longer impacting year-over-year revenuecomparability. Volume was almost 1% abovethe prior year, and about 1.3% abovethe prior year, before the weather impact. Over the last threequarters we have consistently seen growthin our underlying volume of about 1%.This is despite a significant decline,almost 10%, in pre-employment drug testing,which accounts for about 7% of ourtotal volume. As we've explained previously,this tends to be very low pricedbusiness, and its impact to revenue andprofitability is generally less significant. Our employer business,which is predominantly pre-employment drug testing,and our risk assessment business, whichserves life insurers, are our two businessesmost subject to a slowing economy. Yet,the profits for both businesses are abovethe prior year level due to aggressiveactions we have taken to manage theircosts. These businesses, combined, account forless than 10% of our total revenues. Revenue per requisitionincreased 2.3%, with the increase continuingto be primarily driven by a positivemix, and is in line with what wesaw in the first two quarters. Aswe've previously indicated, all of ourlargest health plan contracts have nowbeen renegotiated for multi-year periods, andwe believe there is much more stabilityin pricing than last year. The impact to variousrevenue measures for a number of theitems I've just discussed is includedin a table within footnote 5 inthe earnings release. Operating income asa percentage of revenues was 17.4% forthe third quarter, and reflects continuedimprovement, despite the hurricanes' impact ofapproximately 1.5%, principally due to revenuegrowth and the progress we are makingwith our cost reduction program announcedlast year. That program, which we expectto reduce our cost structure by $500million is on track, and we expectto have delivered over $300 million inannualized savings as we exit this year,with the balance in 2009. Last quarter, I outlinedthe major elements for our program whichinclude using Lean Six Sigma to increaseproductivity in our labs. Driving moreof our purchasing through master contractsto take advantage of our scale. Betteraligning our service capacity with patientand sample flows. Optimizing logistics routesusing more fuel-efficient and using morefuel efficient vehicles. And deploying enhancedconnectivity to our customers and patientservice centers, to reduce costs in specimendata entry and billing, and lower ourbad debt. We are making goodprogress across all of these areas, particularlyin billing and collections, where we continueto see excellent performance in bad debt,days sales outstanding and the cost ofour billing operation. Bad debt expenseas a percentage of revenues was 4.4%,four-tenths of a percent lower than lastyear and unchanged from the second quarter.DSOs were reduced to 45 days, downfrom 46 days at the end of Q2and 48 days at last year-end. With our disciplinedapproach, we expect to see continued strongperformance in our billing and collectionmetrics, despite a slowing economy. Includedin other income expense is a non-cashcharge associated with the write-down ofan equity investment made several yearsago. While the accounting rules requiredus to write-down this investment, we haveretained much of the value we initiallyexpected, through certain rights to theintellectual property associated with varioustests being developing. Diluted earnings pershare from continuing operations were $0.86before the investment write-down and theimpact of hurricanes in the quarter, whichtogether, reduced earnings per share by$0.05. This compares to $0.77 in theprior year, a 12% increase. Last quarter we indicatedthat, combined, our investments in systemsand our start-up in India, would reducefull-year EPS by about $0.17. We incurred$0.05 of the impact in quarter three,bringing the year-to-date total to about$0.12, and now expect to incur about$0.16 per share for the full year. Our lab in India became operational earlier this year. Weare still in the early days oframping up our selling efforts and othersupport functions, but seeing real progress.While this market is expected to bea significant contributor to our internationaloperations, we are not expecting it tocontribute material revenues this year. Our estimate forstart-up losses this year remains about$0.04 per share. We have incurred roughly$0.01 in each of the first threequarters. Our systems investments,expected to total $0.12 per share forthe full year, associated with developingand deploying standard systems across AmeriPathand our clinical labs, are on track.Year-to-date, we incurred roughly $0.09 cents,$0.04 in quarter three of the $0.12per share we expect to spend thisyear on systems enhancements. The cash flow producedby our business continued to be outstanding.Cash from operations increased to $329million for the quarter, compared to $291million last year. During the quarter,we reduced debt by $131 million, bringingour total debt reduction since the AmeriPathacquisition to $830 million. Capital expenditures were$45 million in the quarter. In addition,cash and cash equivalents more than doubled,to $287 million. As you can seefrom our results, we have been veryprudent in the way we've deployed ourcapital and maintained our liquidity duringwhat has been an extremely challengingtime for financial markets worldwide. Our strong cash flow;our accumulated cash balances; and ourunused credit lines, with strong bankingpartners, which total in excess of $1billion, position us very well for theseturbulent times. Until the credit marketsdemonstrate stability, we will continue tobe prudent and conservative in how wedeploy our capital. Turning to 2008 guidancefrom continuing operations. We expect revenuegrowth to exceed 8% for the fullyear. This is slightly below our previousestimate of approximately 9%. The changeis principally due to the impact ofhurricanes in the third quarter, a delayin obtaining approval for one of ourpoint-of-care products, and not seeing theacceleration in volume we had anticipatedin our clinical testing business. While we have notseen the acceleration in testing volumewe had expected, we continue to expectvolumes in the fourth quarter to growat rates similar to what we haveseen year-to-date. We continue to expectoperating income as a percentage of revenuesto approach 17%. We continue to expectcash from operations to approximate $900million. And we now expectcapital expenditures of between $200 millionand $220 million. And lastly, we haveincreased our estimate for adjusted dilutedearnings per share and now expect between$3.17 and $3.22, excluding the third quarterimpact of hurricanes and the investmentwrite-down, and any potential special charges. These are challengingeconomic times, and no company will betotally immune. However, we are well positionedto not only weather them, but tofurther strengthen our competitive position.We have already made the investments whichprovide us with truly unparalleled assetsand capabilities, making it harder forothers to catch up during a periodwhen, for many, access to capital willbe constrained. Our program to reducecosts and drive efficiencies has beenunderway for some time, and already hasexcellent momentum. And our strong financialcondition and cash flow characteristics willprovide us with the ability to operateour business and take advantage of growthopportunities more freely than others. Becauseof these strengths, we are confident inour prospects for both the near termand the long-term. Now I'll turn itback to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks,Bob. Over the past several years wehave taken a series of bold anddecisive actions to drive profitable growth,expand margins, diversify our business anddifferentiate ourselves from our competitors.Let me comment on our progress. Our approach to profitablegrowth is to leverage our sales, serviceand science. Our revenue growth is drivenby increased demand for all test categories,including gene-based, esoteric and routine tests.Gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grewby almost 10% during the quarter. Testingvolume for Vitamin D, testosterone, Chlamydia,gonorrhea, and HPV testing all grew indouble digits. We also saw stronggrowth in certain segments of routinetesting during the quarter. The ImmunoCAP allergyblood testing continued to grow at strongdouble-digit rates from a larger existingbase, with food allergy volume up 35%during the quarter, and non-food testingup more than 20%. Celiac disease testingincreased more than 25%. And InSure colorectalcancer screening volume was up over 15%.Leveraging our science with strong innovationand quality remains at the core ofhow we drive growth. We are keenlyfocused on expanding our leadership positionin cancer diagnostics. We recently introducedthe new HE-4 blood test for ovariancancer recurrence. This is the only testin the last 20 years to receiveFDA clearance for monitoring ovarian cancer,and we are the only national referencelab to offer it. Ovarian cancer isthe fifth most common cause of cancer-relateddeath among women in the U.S., with more than 15,000 deaths and nearly22,000 new cases diagnosed per year. This is just themost recent example in a long historyof new innovative tests and technologybrought to market by Quest Diagnostics. The centerpiece ofour business is diagnostic testing. Wehave unparallel assets and capabilities. Inorder to leverage these assets for growthand increase our operational efficiency, wehave been focusing on various customersegments who need our products and services,such as Patients, Physicians, Health Plans,Hospitals, Employers, Life Insurers and PharmaCompanies. We are expandingour diagnostic scope and we are expandingour geographic reach. Over the longer term,we expect additional growth to come fromsome of our newer businesses, such aspoint-of-care testing and international. We are seeing stronggrowth in near-patient, or point-of-care testing,growing at greater than 10% year-to-date.Increased demand for CLIA-waived testing helpeddrive the growth. We have had strongersales in the U.S. in 2008. Ourlargest point-of-care customer, the AmericanRed Cross, has accelerated its use ofour hemoglobin testing. We are making progressin India. Our market presence is growingand we are adding new customers. Wehave also expanded our lab and fieldpresence, and strengthened our management teamin Delhi. In addition, I'm pleased thatwe won our first tender in thestate of Maharashtra to screen hemoglobinlevels for all blood bank donors usingour HemoCue device. As you have heardme say before, as we enter thedecade of diagnostics, healthcare is movingfrom a focus solely on curative careto a recognition of the value ofdetection, prevention and personalized care. We are encouragedby a growing trend that recognizes theimportance of promoting wellness and prevention;that empowers patients to take controlof their health; and that encourages employersto create healthy workplaces. This trendtoward wellness bodes well for Quest Diagnostics. We are empoweringpatients, and collaborating with payers, governmentsand employers to make people healthier.Consider our collaborations to drive awarenessof the value of early detection forcolorectal cancer. To-date, payers includingAetna, CIGNA and Independence Blue Cross,and the state of Tennessee have givenhundreds of thousands of our convenientInSure test to their members, employeesand residents. We are helping employerscreate healthier workplaces and helping employeesto take ownership of their health byparticipating in our Blueprint for Wellnessprogram. This provides individuals with acomprehensive health risk report including laboratorytest results. Large employers such asDomino's Pizza, the Houston Independent School Districts and Jeld-Wen, are enthusiasticusers of this exciting wellness service. Through our collaborationwith Google Health, we are empoweringpatients to manage their personal healthinformation and get a better understandingof their health status using lab testing.As the only laboratory partner of GoogleHealth, we make it easy and convenientfor people to manage their lab resultsand other health information in theirpersonal health record. Now we are furtherenabling Google Health users to buy alimited menu of tests for themselves to monitortheir health and wellness. We are alsohelping to reduce medical errors and improvepatient safety by helping physician customersuse our Care360 physician portal to ordertests and prescribe drugs electronically. As we have enhancedthe portal, its utilization has grown.For example, the number of eprescriptionsthrough Care360 more than doubled in Septemberto nearly 300,000 compared to a yearearlier. Our operating marginshave grown through top-line growth andcost savings. We have embraced Six Sigmaand Lean principles as a way todrive improvements in the quality andefficiency of our service. This has becomepart of our corporate culture which putspatients first and is based on theneed for continuous improvement in allthat we do. We are on trackto meet our commitment to reduce ourcost structure by $500 million by theend of next year. We continue toexpect that over time we will achieveoperating margins of 20%. In summary, we arethe leader in an attractive industry thatprovides an important and essential healthcareservice. While diagnostic testing is notimmune to economic challenges, the challengesare far outweighed by the opportunities. We continue to differentiateourselves from our competitors through oursuperior patientcentric service, Six Sigma quality,innovative new tests and advanced technology. We are bifocal, doingwhat is right for the business inthe short-term and planning for the long-term. Our company remainsstrong operationally and financially. This enablesus to execute our strategy without distractionthrough the current political and economicenvironment and to take advantage of opportunitiesthat may arise in the future. Thank you. We willnow take your questions. Operator? Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comesfrom Amanda Murphy. Your line is open,and please state your company.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Hi, good morning. Its AmandaMurphy from William Blair. Just a coupleof questions. You mentioned that volumeor say, revenue growth on the esotericside is running at the 10% levels.Can you break that down in anywaybetween pricing and volume growth, andsort of how that stranded through theyear?
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: Amanda, wereally are focused on revenue growth.And, the revenue growth is up about10%. We're seeing strong growth as weindicated in Vitamin D testing, whichis driven off increased demand acrossthe industry, as you hear for thattest, as well as improved demand alsoon HPV, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Amanda, you should expect thatthe majority of that growth in theesoteric testing is more volume driven,given the fact it has been a newertesting.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay,thanks. That's helpful. And then, on thepoint-of-care side, can you just talkabout what perhaps has surprised you both,on the positive side and on thenegative side, as you bring those teststo market? And also, have you beenable to apply any big clearances fromNIB, I know, as you commercialize point-of-caretesting?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well,let me comment on you about thepoint-of-care. Remember only 18 month agowe acquired HemoCue, which is a verywell-established point-of-care near present testingcompany. And when you look at thepoint-of-care platform of near present testingwe have Enterix, HemoCue and Focus diagnostics.What we are doing actually is takingtesting to the patient's bed side andas we increase our coverage and useour distribution channel, we find thatsome of the main customer like AmericanRed Cross, they are accelerating the adoptionof some of the platform. So weare pleased with the adoption of ourproducts. The only work we have todo is to continue convincing the doctorsand the FDA and the regulators thatthere is more to gain using point-of-carein the clear way of laboratory inthe doctor's office.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Haveyou seen any increase in a regulatoryscrutiny in terms of tax you're offeringto Google for example.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No,we have not seen any regulatory scrutinynor do we expect any scrutiny becauseremember the patient is seeking Googleto put their health records and thedoctors have to agree to that andthe patient has to give us a consent.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay.Thank you very much.
Operator: We havea question from Adam Feinstein. Your lineis open. Please state your company.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Yes, Barclays Capital. Good morningeveryone. Just, I guess a few questions.Why don't we start with the volumes.So just wanted to just get somemore thoughts in terms of... and clearlythe big question one is trying tofigure out is the economy impacting volumes.Volume grows, with respect to hurricanesis slightly lower than what it wasaveraging in the first half of theyear. So as you think about thedifference there, just curious in termsof how you think about the economylaying on that or was some of thatjust a fact you analyzed the EDNA[ph] contract win. And so just curiousin terms of your thoughts around what'sgoing on with the volumes.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: HiAdam, this is Bob. To-date, listen wehave seen significant impact outside ofour employer and risk assessments businessesand as you know both of those businessesare feeling the effects. We are addressingthat through working the cost structuresand in fact the profitability for bothof those businesses is better than itwas a year ago. Now, with that said,the rest of our business why Ithink it's much more insulated than othertypes of businesses is not totally immuneto an economic slowdown. And the impactto the degree, there is much ofone, will be difficult to measure butwill likely be reflected as a temporaryslowing of our growth rate. And aswe've said or longer short in volume.We still fully expect to see positiverevenue in earnings growth as we lookahead. In fact, in Q3 volume growthwas inline with what we saw year-to-dateand in Q4 we're expecting volumes ofabout 1% or so which is generallyinline with what we've seen year-to-date. There could be someimpact that we're seeing at this point.As you know, we did reduce slightlyour expectations for revenue growth butit wasn't really all just clinical testing.Certainly, the hurricanes impacted that somewhat.We had had some product delays inour point-of-care business, most noticeably theWBC test which we're hoping to haveintroduced by now. And we're not seeingthe acceleration in volume that we hadexpected in the clinical testing business. I think that couldbe a combination of a couple ofthings. It could be... some of itcould be the economy, although that'sdifficult to measure and then, we areseeing a slightly slower ramp up ingrowth from selling more anatomic pathologyinto primary care physicians. It's takinga little longer to get that established.But otherwise nothing significant at thispoint.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes,I just wanted to make a comment,Adam. The way I look at the economy...healthcare segment is an attractive segmentand diagnostic testing in healthcare remainsvery attractive. And as you know, it'snot an elastic business. If the economywas growing faster, it doesn't mean thatit will go and do more blood test.At the same time, I don't thinkpeople are going to delay there atsome sort of healthcare services. So,we have seen in past the diagnostictesting to some extent is less affectedby the changes in the economy. Andwhen I look at this industry with$45 billion revenue per year, and whenI look at the demographics, I reallyfeel excited about the opportunity, thediagnostic testing has compared to allother industries. So we are actuallypretty excited about the future. And weare operationally strong. We are financiallystrong. And we're looking forward to takeadvantage of the situation.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Okay.And just I have follow-up question here,I appreciate all the detail there. Justmaybe comment on the bad debt expense.Also, you guys have done a goodjob in terms of managing the baddebt expense. So just curious to getyour thoughts there in terms of what'sgoing on. And do you think thecurrent levels are sustainable, excuse me.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well,certainly bad debt and DSOs are theother places where the economic impactcould show up. But as you've seen,both of those have improved over theprior year, and ends throughout this yearfor us. And while there could besome impact to these metrics, I don'texpect it to be significant because, asyou know, unlike hospitals, the vast majorityof our patientsthat we serve are really insuredpatients. And on top of that, Ithink we have a very solid billingand collections process and we are alsoworking to do more collections of paymentsat the point of service as wellwhich we think will help.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: And then just a final questionon the bad debt and I'll get backin the queue. But just, if we stripout the AmeriPath's bad debt, I know it is not includedin the same store but just curiousin terms of just have you madeprogress. That was one of the areasyou were targeting. So just curious interms of whether the trend has gonebetter there also.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you stripout the impact of AmeriPath, we arepretty comparable to where we were ayear ago.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question isfrom Tom Gallucci, Your lineis open. Please state your company.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Merrill Lynch.Thank you. Maybe just a follow upshere. Bob, just on that last answerthat you had. So you're statingthat sort of core Quest was tosort of stable year-over-year which shouldimply that AmeriPath did get a littlebetter so you're making some progresson bad debt on that side.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.We continue to make progress there.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. But then on the revenueside, it sounds like that part ofor maybe you haven't had as muchprogress as you expect it when youtalk about selling AP through to theprimary care docs that would be someof the revenue related type synergiesat AmeriPath. Is that right?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Itis. Yes, its an opportunity that wefeel is still as big as it everwas. We just got off to a slowerstart there than we were anticipating.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Is there any particular reasonwhy that happened or it is a harderthing than you thought it was goingto be or any more color that youcan offer?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No,it's just a way integrating both thecompanies than we are taking it regionby region. So we are doing somepiloting in some places. So, Tom, itstaking a little longer than what youhad expected but I think we onlydo it the right way.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Bob, on a topic ofthat that maybe could you just remindus how you do accrue bad debt,just for the sake of making surethat to the extent there appears changein the patient mix; that would beaccurate slightly this quarter as opposedto if it delays you don't get thatbill in six to 12 months from now.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: WellI'll try not to take you througha detailed accounting. But essentially theway it works is, we have a veryrigorous policy that looks at a receivablesby payer type and as they age outrequires additional reserves. Where at onepoint you have to fully reserve thatreceivable if it ages out beyond acertain level. So I'm very confident inthe process that we use to establishour reserves so that we are notgoing to have any surprises there.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: All right. So what you aredescribing there, right up front thoughif it's a one payer versus anotherpayer you take a different level ofapproval. Is that what were you --
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then my last questionis just on CapEx. You lowered yourexpectations there last quarter, now theyare lower again. So, it's a prettysignificant difference from where you werein the beginning of the year. What'sthe biggest driver there?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.I would tell you that it's reallyjust prudent capital management. We haveasked all of our managers to reallytake a hard look at capital spendingto see if they can cut back ordelay some projects. Some of those actuallyare in the IT area. India, as youknow, is ramping up a little slowerthan we had thought and we hadsome capital in there although still lessthan 10% of our total. And we'vefrankly differed some facility expansions. Butwith that, keep in mind, we've historicallyinvested in our operating and our technologyinfrastructure and it gives us the abilityto moderate our spending if we wantto, but without adversely impacting ourbusiness or its prospects. So, I feelvery comfortable that we can tighten ourbelts right now. Some of this maybejust deferred until next year. But alot of times you find out thatwhen you go without something, maybe yourealize that you could have done withoutit completely. So, I'm hoping if that'sthe case as well.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Yourline is open. Please state your companyname.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks. Credit Suisse. Can you maybe estimatethe impact of the extra day inthe quarter and sort of how youthink about that in terms of theguidance that you put out in the4Q, or for 2008, and implied 4Q.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thatwas fully built into the guidance thatwe had out there.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay.Any estimate for the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Whatthe impact was?
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Yes.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Around1%, or so.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay.And then, with the NID settlement, maybeany updated thoughts for usage of cash.And specifically, maybe thoughts on acquisitionsjust given the current market conditions?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well,first I would tell you that we'vebeen pretty conservative in the way we'vedeployed capital over the last quarteror so. And as I think about it,our first objective with respect to capitalis to make sure we preserve it.And that's why you saw us buildup the cash balance this last quarter. Once the credit marketshave demonstrated that they've returned tosome sense of normalcy, and they canstay there, you'll see us deploy capitalsimilar to what we've done historically.Our credit stats have continued to improveover the course of the last yearsas we've paid down debt. And whiledebt reduction is going to continue tobe in area where we will deploycash, we'll also be able to givemore consideration though to acquisitions andshare repurchases. Between the two ofthose, I generally see acquisitions asa priority over share repurchases. Theybetter position the company for sustainablegrowth in shareholder returns. And I'dexpect valuations may become a littlemore attractive as well. And as youknow like we've done historically, whenacquisitions aren't available at the rightprice, we'll deploy the excess cash intoshare repurchases. And there generally,while we won't be in the marketevery quarter repurchasing shares, over thecourse of the year we typically wouldpurchase at a minimum, the amount necessaryto offset the delusion associated withour equity plans.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay.And then just my last one. Canyou maybe talk a little bit moreabout India. I know you had mentionedsome progress there. I know, there wassome management turnover in that area.Can you talk about some of theprogress? What you're seeing? Where you'reat? I know you've talked about itbeing also a little bit slow, interms of some of the CapEx projects.But just a little bit more detailon that, and what's going on there.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.India remains the most attractive marketas far as international is concerned.And it is also the most importantfocus for us, because in the longerterm, in three or five years, weexpect enormous growth from a country,which has 300 million middle class. We have built astate-of-the-art laboratory, not only the bestin India, probably best in the AsiaPacific, in that Pacific region. And weare going through hiring people, trainingpeople, improving our operational and medicalneed. We have to make some changesin management. We wanted to strengthenour management now that we accomplishphase of growth, rather than just operationalefficiency there. And we are gaining customers,and if you think about the Indiabusiness, it's not only... the laboratoryis not only going to do testingfor hospitals and physicians, but alsoit is designed to do testing forpharma companies for clinical trials andthe life insurers. So, I'm very pleasedwith where we are. I would havelike to really move much faster asfar as the customer acquisition. But goingforward with the new management, we justleveraged our marketing campaign. We juststarted actually last month. So, I'm veryexcited about the opportunities that wehave in the future. But it is littlebit slow than what I thought.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay.Thank you.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Don Brock [ph]. Yourline is open. Please state your company.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure, JPMorgan.The first thing I just wanted toask really quickly was on the EPSraise, I mean I feel like we'vekind of talked around it, I meanspecifically, have you built in an increasein debt repayment or share repurchasefor the fourth quarter that's going todrive the upside to the number?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Theanswer to that is no. And franklyeven if we aggressively repurchase sharesin the fourth quarter or pay downdebt in the fourth quarter, it doesn'thave that much of an impact inthe quarter than do you it.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thankyou. The second thing was, Surya, inyour opening remarks, you talked aboutthe possibility from a competitive andfrom an opportunity perspective, of somebusiness moving to some of the largerindependent labs from the hospital outreachprograms. Could you just give a littlebit more color around that?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.As you heard from Bob, that wehave been investing in our company andover the last four years, we've beenpreparing ourselves how to improve thequality, how to provide the products andservices that is required, not only forphysician and managed care organization butalso for hospitals and the pharma companiesand what I was referring to thatthis is a situation now when lotsof people have difficulty to access capital.And I have a number of discussionwith many hospitals who would like tohave somebody manage their laboratories withhigh quality tests and then they don'thave to spend the extra capital toobtain their laboratories. So we see thatgoing forward, we will work with hospitalsto manage their labs and also toupdate their labs. As far as theoutreach business is concerned, I thinkas always I say that there willbe 10 or 12 outreach businesses butonce you go above a certain regionand above certain dollars, you have todo the same way as everybody else.You have to managed care contracts, youhave to logistics, you have to havebilling. So I don't think there isa lot of changes, increase in outreach.In fact what we have seen overthe last 18 months there are anumber of outreach laboratories there forsale. So, again we are not immuneto economic challenges, but our businesshas plenty of room to grow andwith the operationally strong company aswe are and financially strong, we areready to take advantage of some ofthe opportunity that may come in frontof us.
Unidentified Analyst: Now doesthat mean that you would be moreinclined at this point to manage orwork with the hospitals versus acquiringsome of those programs that might beon the block right now?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Atthe moment we do work with thehospitals. We manage some laboratories andin past we have bought some ofthe hospital business and again we toldyou last year that for 12 monthswe will be not going to acquireanything until we integrate AmeriPath andnow you heard from Bob that asthe credit market comes back to normalcywe will utilize our cash appropriatelyto acquire right assets at right value.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: AndDon, when we talked about acquiring hospitalbusiness, typically we are talking abouttheir outreach programs. When we talkabout managing business for hospitals, weare really talking about their labs inthe hospital typically serving the inpatientand the outpatient areas.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Gotyou.
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: And eachhospital has a variety of needs andit will be met [ph] accordingly.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thanksguys.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Robert Willoughby. Yourline is open. Please state your company.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Hi, Banc of America. Three questions. The guidance you provided, therewas some language thing, and it includespotential special charges. Are you expectingsomething in the fourth quarter of sizeor magnitude?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Nothingspecific at this point, Bob. Again wealways... that's the qualifier that we alwaysput out there every time when weput guidance out.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay.And you did reference clinical testingresults a bit lower than where youthought they would be. Was there arationale for that, any reason?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: AsI said earlier, it could be, someof it, a slowing economy, although thatits really difficult to measure. But again,when I think about the change inrevenue guidance, we went from approximately9% to over 8%. So, it's a modestadjustment there and while we slightlyadjust with the top-line, we actuallybrought the bottom-line up.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay.But that is your pharma testing business,Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'msorry?
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Isthat the pharma... the clinical trial testingbusiness?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No,no, no. This was clinical testing, notclinical trials testing.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: I'msorry, then I misunderstood that. Andjust lastly, is there any ramifications,I guess there is a felony chargehere. Is there any ramification whatsoeveron your government business, or are theseexclusive?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Idon't expect that at all. The criminalplea was a single count of felonymisbranding by a subsidiary NID, whichhas been closed now since 2006. Therewere no criminal charges against QuestDiagnostics.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay.Great.
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: Your questionand based on the agreement and principal,we don't expect any impact as relatedto our participation in federal programs.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: That'sgreat. Thank you.
Operator: We havea question from Kemp Dolliver. Your lineis open. Please state your company.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Hi. Cowen & Company. Question... firstquestion relates to AmeriPath, and spreadsheetthat came out. It showed AmeriPath actuallybeing a small drag on consolidated revenuesthis quarter. Is that hurricane related,or some other factor?
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: Kemp, Ithink you're looking at the year-to-dateimpact for AmeriPath. I mean, AmeriPath isfully anniversaried this quarter. And thereis no separate breakout of the AmeriPath impact to our revenues.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Actually,I'm looking at Q3, and it's inthere. We can take this offline. Butit's definitely...
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: I'll verify.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay.Thanks. The other question is it relatesto your moderation of revenue growth.Is Health Alliance a factor in that?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly,it is. Yes. That's a management agreementthat we had; that's been discontinued.And there will be... there are actuallyseveral lab management agreements that weterminated over the course of the lastyear or so.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay.And any particular strategy behind that?Was it just individual situation throughtheir sapping [ph] business.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes,every one of those is unique. So,if you've seen one, you've seen one,basically. That's what I could tell youabout the...
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thereare very individual situation. You knowwhat happened with Health Alliance. Itsnothing to do with us but everythingto do within Cincinnati.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Butas Surya pointed out though, this Ithink will be a bigger opportunity forus as we look forward because hospitalswill be capital constrained.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: All right.Okay, good. And just my last questionBob, you're running any higher cash balancethan normal. Is that a reflection ofto do with the credit markets atthis point?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes,that's temporary. As I said our firstpriority right now in this market hasbeen to preserve capital but certainlyonce things free up you'll see uscarry a smaller cash balance.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Great.Thanks a lot.
Operator: There isa question from Ricky Goldwasser.Your line is open. Please state yourcompany name.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Good morning.Just to clarify with some follow-up questions.Bob you mentioned that fourth quartervolumes are going to be at about1% and if we back into yourtop-line guidance, I get about 1.5% revenuegrowth. So and my question here, arewe comparing the first quarter, the 1%volume increase, is this apples-to-apples withthe 0.7% reported for the third quarteror is this adjusted for deteriorationin drugs-of-abuse and hoarse [ph], etcetera.And then secondly, what are you kindof like thinking about in terms ofprice because again, if we're thinking1.5% top-line growth, 1% volume growth,is this implied that the pricing metricis going to come down.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes,Ricky I think your squeeze is probablynot giving enough credit to the fourthquarter. We are expecting more than 1.5%revenue growth and the growth in volumethat we're expecting in Q4 is reallyapples-to-apples with the volumes that we'vebeen reporting here obviously before theAmeriPath acquisition.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. I mean for therevenue growth, I'm just kind of likethinking you are saying about 8% andyou did 6.5% I think year-to-date?
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: It wouldbe greater than 8%. So, I'm guessingthat's probably a piece of what's drivingaround in, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. And as far asthe pricing goes?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Idon't see any reason for pricing tobe any different in Q4 than itwas for the rest of the year orfor the year, earlier part of theyear?
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. And then one housekeepingon the test rate, test rate inthe third quarter is a little bithigher than what we estimated. Shouldwe assume test rates will go downin the first quarter or should weassume similar levels to what in thethird quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well,first I don't typically provide guidanceon the tax rate but I wouldn'texpect it to be significantly different,the underlying tax rate to be significantlydifferent in Q4 compared to Q3.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We havea question from Gary Taylor. Your lineis open. Please state your company name.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Hi.Good morning. Citigroup. I had a questionabout the fourth quarter time doing thearithmetic correct. I believe implied 4Qearnings is 76 to 81. Is that right?
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: Yes.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: That seemsto imply... well, that would be down6% to 12% sequentially. I think yourtypical 4Q seasonality is down more like5% to 6%. So, is there somethingelse being baked in, in terms ofconservatism or concern on the low end?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Iwouldn't say there is anything else beingbaked in. I think if you go backover the years our business has changeda little bit as we've done variousacquisitions and let's call it the seasonalityfrom quarter-to-quarter quarter-to-quarter that yousaw in the past isn't necessarily indicativeof what you're going to see goingforward.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. That'swhat primarily growth away from the routinebusinesses, if the change in the business?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Someof it. Sure.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. Canyou give us the balance sheet allowanceagainst the growth data.
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: Gary, the 10-Q will be filed on Thursday,which will have that number on itas well.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. Andthen finally, can you talk about selfpay revenue in the quarter. I knowthat was up about 50 basis pointslast year. What does that look likein the third quarter or year-to-date?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.Generally, it's up between 5% and 6%of our total revenues. It hasn't changeddramatically. We haven't seen a big changethere. So... and that's mostly the uninsuredthat we classify as patient direct embeddedin our third party is the portionassociated with deductibles and co-pays, whichis about equal to that amount. So,in total there is probably 10% to12% that we collect from patients ofour revenues. And that hasn't changeddramatically.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: No spikinggrowth in uninsured volume, given thejob environment that's held pretty stable.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No.There hasn't really been any spiking growth.Nor has there been any increase inour receivables balances or aging associatedwith patient pay either.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. Thankyou.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Art Henderson. Yourline is open. Please state your companyname.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Hi, thanks. With Jefferies. Bob, I'msorry. I got cut off for part ofthe call, but DSOs, how low canyou foresee getting those numbers?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Pushingthat. Our goal is to continue drivingthem down where we can. A lot ofit has to do with making sure youget the right billing information upfront.But additionally I think as we domore and more electronic and activitywith our physicians and then we domore and more electronic payments withour large payers, I think that canhelp drive that down over time. Butat this point I'd rather stay awayfrom trying to give you some specificguidance around DSOs.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Is itsafe to say though, that a lotof low hanging fruit has now gone.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely.I mean if you look at our DSOsover the last five to six yearsor so, they've come down pretty dramatically.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yes.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Anda lot of that had to do withnot only getting the low hanging fruitbut also going after some of thereally hard stuff too. And I think,our billing operation is very efficient.It's very focused on getting the informationupfront that you need in order tobill properly because really, as I havetold people all along here, billing isall about getting the right informationupfront. If you don't get it upfront,and you try to get it later, youare really going to have a challengein collecting things.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay. That'sfair. One, actually two more questions,one for you, Bob. With the economyslowing down obviously, is there an opportunityto reduce compensation expense to someextent is there more people out thereat some of the lower levels wherethere might be some opportunity?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No.I think that first of all, we havebeen improving our operational efficiency andwe've been trying a number of wayswhere we can give flexible work force.But we are not going to changeour strategy. We have been doing thesething for last three or four yearsand the company has become much moreefficient. We are going to drive ourgrowth strategy and the cost improvementstrategy without any changes at the moment.But we'll be prudent as far ascapital expenses and operational expenses. ButI'm not seeing any major reduction.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Andour goal all along with our costreduction program has actually been totake work out, so that we needfewer people to do the work andnot necessarily try to pay them less.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Yes, understood.Okay. One last question. Surya, you mentionedwellness a few times in your preparedremarks. Is there a bigger opportunitythere that you are seeing either inthe way of an acquisition or somethingthat we should start to think about?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Wellfirst of all, I think its the sametesting whether it is for illness orfor wellness and if you look atour company over the last four years,we have tried to bring more customersso that we can utilize our fixedcost infrastructure. The laboratories are usedin the night and we are utilizingthat infrastructure whether it is forhospital or managed care physician, employer,pharma, insurer. So now the biggest trendpeople have realized to reduce healthcare cost to take care of peoplebefore they become sick and that's whatI was referring that both the presidentialcandidates are thinking about prevention andfitness. So we think thisis a great opportunity and we havebuilt up a small business what wecall blue print for wellness. We areworking with employers and governments howto create awareness about health reassessmentand the associate test. So going forward,you will see us focusing on thatarea and I really believe that's agreat opportunity. So if there is againopportunity for us to buy a coupleof companies to strengthen our platform,we will do that. But I considerwellness testing is as important as illnesstesting.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Great. Thanksvery much. Very nice quarter.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thankyou.
Operator: We havea question from William Bonello. Yourline is open. Please state your companyname.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Sure. Bill Bonello with Wachovia. Thanks.Just a question on trying to understandsort of the impact of the costsavings and what potentially might beoffsetting that. I mean, if I thinkof the magnitude of dollars that youguys are talking about having saved exitingthe year and how that compares lastyear, it would seem like we shouldhave seen a greater amount of marginexpansion than what we have seen ona year-over-year basis. And so, I knowa little bit of that is impactedby some of the cost initiatives. Although,those seem to have been pretty minimalin 2008. I'm just curious, if youcan speak to what else is impactingthe cost structure, and why we can'tsimply lay on $100 million or $150million of savings on top of revenue,and see that kind of margin expansion.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well,it would be nice if it was thateasy. But, as you recall, at thebeginning of the year, some of theprice concessions that we made last year,when we renegotiated managed care contractskicked in. And certainly that's one ofthe things that put downward pressureon the margins this year, which arebeing offset by some of the costreduction programs. And then, in additionto that, we've got what I'll callnormal inflationary increases for salaries, wages,benefits etcetera.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Would yousay that cost saving initiatives causedinflation is outpacing revenue growth?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Temporarilyin '07, it was outpacing the pricingthat we saw as a result of theconcessions that we made in '07.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Andthat's probably carried through due thetime in 2008?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.But now again, what I'd remind youis pricing is much more stable thanit was a year ago because all ofthose contracts were negotiated for multipleyear periods.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: And whendo we completely annualize the impactof any price cuts that you've taken?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It'llbe sometime next year.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Beginningprobably more front-end loaded or --
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Morein the first half of the year.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. So,when we think of the incremental dollarsslowing through on cost savings in '09,should we think of a more dramaticmargin impact or are there other considerationsin '09 that would offset some ofthat impact?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Whydon't we get in to more of thosedetails when we provide '09 guidance?
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: That'sfair. Thank you very much.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Onlyfew months left. Thank you.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Ba-bye.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ba-bye.
Operator: We havea question from Shelly Norm [ph]. Yourline is open. Please state your company.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks GoldmanSachs. Its Shelly in for Matt Borsch.I have a couple of questions onthe balance sheet and I apologize Idropped off the call for a coupleof minutes as well. Just let meknow if you have already addressed this.Just wondering, with the NID probableon settlement exceeding the balance sheetcash and that you've currently got, I'mwondering if you could update us onyour availability under the revolver.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.As I said in our prepared remarks,we have in excess of $1 billionavailable under our revolver. And withrespect to NID, and the funding there,the timing of the payment or paymentsstill needs to be finalized. I wouldn'tautomatically assume that its going tobe in a lumpsum. Those details reallyneed to be worked out at this point.But I certainly expect that some combinationof our cash flow, the cash on handand our available credit facilities willbe used to fund those payments whendue.
Unidentified Analyst: So, if wecould just go into a little bitmore detail. The revolver itself I believeis $750 million and then you've gotan accounts receivable securitization worth about$400 million.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Unidentified Analyst: No. Notto get too deep in the weeds, butI'm just wondering, I think that securitizationis going to expiring at the endof '08? So the way we sort of--
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Actuallyits only $125 million of that expiresat the end of '08. And we arein the process of trying to replacethat at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Sowe can definitely think about $750 millionthat's available on that revolver thoughthere is no letters of credit. Okay,okay. So, going back to, there hasbeen a couple of comments that waitinguntil credit markets return to normalcy,we may take a look at doing somemore M&A. I'm just wondering, isn'tthis the opportunity to be out onas a buyer, maybe not right nowthis quarter, but if the credit marketsdon't return to normal and you haveadequate access to capital and there couldbe some very attractive multiples outthere. Just wondering if you could talkabout might that be a strategic changein direction for you, especially if weassume going into next year, the economycontinues to be slow, maybe these volumescontinue to be somewhat slower than expected,you supplement the top-line by going outand buying other companies.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.There is no reason that we wouldn't.But until we see that there issome liquidity return to the marketplace,I think it makes sense for us tobe very prudent in how we deploycash. But certainly as you pointed outand as I said earlier, I thinkthat valuations should even be more attractiveas we look ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: But youare not implying that you would needto go to access the credit marketfor an additional facility.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No,I'm not implying that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great.And then just housekeeping if I could.Can you tell me when LIBOR resetsfor your floating rate does?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It'sactually resetting later this month.
Unidentified Analyst: And that'sfor fourth quarter interest expense?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'msorry?
Unidentified Analyst: I'm wonderingon the fourth quarter interest expense,when we think about LIBOR resetting forthe quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ijust said it's going to reset laterthis month.
Laure Park - Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations: The quarterwill be a mix of two rates.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it.Okay, great. Thanks. And I just wantto... I guess I'll leave it there.
Operator: Our finalquestion comes from Daren Larik [ph].Your line is open. Please state yourcompany.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Thanksfor taking my questions. It's Daren Larik[ph] with Deutsche Bank. I guess, justa question here with regard to howyou're working with managed care, as theylook to steer high volumes away fromhigher cost settings, mainly the hospitalsettings. Do you see any momentum withthat strategy? And just want to getyour thoughts as to whether you thinkthere could be an offset somewhat, ifthe economy has an impact on seculargross rates of your volumes and testing.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Tobe successful in steering leakage, wehave to work together. And we havequite a number of managed care organizationsthat are very active in doing thesethings, for example Aetna and CIGNA, weare working with them. And we haveto have the information. We have towork hand in hand. And I thinkthat's an opportunity for us. But going back tothe hospitals it's not only steering someof the tests that's going to thehospital. I'm talking about doing highquality innovative tests for hospitals, whichwe are very well positioned to do,either by managing their laboratories orproviding them tests because we have thevolume and the expertise, and we canhave a weaker turnaround than they have.And I think with the current situation,and with our strength in hospital business,I look forward to deeper market share,more market share, and gaining more presencein the hospital market.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That'sall.

A copy of our earning's press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later this morning in the quarterly updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A downloadable spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis is also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Laure. We've delivered another strong quarter and I am pleased with our progress. Our business is performing well, executing our plans has enabled us to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Revenues grew 12% to $1.8 billion, earnings per share increased 14%, cash flow improved to $213 million, volume increased by 5%. And we exercise strong cost discipline which contributed to our margin improvement and positions us well to respond to changing economic conditions. After we hear from Bob, I will share details of our progress. Bob?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Surya. As you heard we reported another strong quarter and are firmly on track to meet the goals we established for the year. As I take you through results, I'll highlight a number of key initiatives and our progress in each area. Before I do, a quick comment regarding NID; we are continuing our discussion with the government to attempt to settle this matter. We have made no adjustments to our reserve and have no further updates to share with you. Now, let's turn to the results for the second quarter. Revenues were $1.8 billion, 12% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing about 8% growth. Revenues for our clinical testing business, which account for about 90% of our total revenues, were 12.4% above the prior year, and about 4% above without AmeriPath. Volume was 4.9% above the prior year and about 1% above the prior year before the AmeriPath acquisition. Over the last three quarters, we have consistently seen growth in our underlying volume of between 1% and 2%. This is despite a significant decline, almost 10% in pre-employment drug testing, which accounts for about 7% of our total volume. Given that this tends to be very low-priced business, the impact to revenue and profitability is generally much less. Our employer business which is predominantly pre-employment drug testing and our risk assessment business, which serves life insurers, are our two businesses most subject to a slowing economy. Yet the profits for both businesses are above the prior year level due to aggressive actions we have taken to manage their costs. These businesses combined account for less than 10% of our total revenues and we do not expect their performance to alter our consolidated revenue or earnings expectations for the year. Revenue per acquisition increased 7.1% with 4.5% of the increase due to AmeriPath. The balance of the increase in revenue per acquisition about 2.5% continues to be primarily driven by a positive mix, partially offset by price reductions on various health plan contracts. And is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. As we previously indicated, all of our all of our largest health plan contracts have now been renegotiated for multi-year periods, and we believe there is much more stability in pricing than a year ago. And lastly, on the topic of revenue growth we saw strong double-digit growth in our point-of-care and healthcare IT businesses in the quarter. You'll hear more from Surya on the point-of-care business. Included in footnote four to the earnings release is a table, which summarizes the impact of various revenue measures, for a number of the items discussed. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% for the second quarter and reflects continued improvement from both the prior year and this year's first quarter, principally due to revenue growth and the progress we are making with our cost reduction program. That program which we expect to reduce our cost structure by $500 million as we exit 2009, delivered over $100 million in savings as we exited last year. And we expect another $200 million as we exit this year, with the final $200 million in 2009. Last quarter I outlined the major elements of our program, which include, using Lean Six Sigma to streamline our processes and increase productivity in our labs, driving more of our purchasing through mass of contracts that take advantage of our scale. Driving efficiencies in other areas like better aligning our service capacity with patient and sample flows, improving the efficiency of our logistics routes, using the advanced route optimization tools and more fuel efficient vehicles. And, the point enhanced connectivity to our customers and patient service centers, to reduce costs and specimen data entry and billing and lower our bad debt. We're making good progress across all of these areas particularly in billing and collections, where we have accelerated a number our efforts to reduce bad debt, day sales outstanding, and the cost of our billing operation. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, four tenths of a percent lower than the first quarter, and three tenths of a percent lower than last year, before the inclusion of AmeriPath. DSOs were reduced to 46 days, down from 48 days at the end of Q1 and 51 days a year ago. As you know AmeriPath carries a higher bad debt rate than the rest of our business and is one of the opportunities we have identified. During this last quarter we've began to see solid progress in this area. With our disciplined approach and the acceleration of our efforts, we now expect to see continued strong performance in our billing and collection metrics despite a slowing economy. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.83 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, a 14% increase. About $0.01 of the increase is due to a lower tax rate than a year ago, as result of a favorable resolution to certain tax contingencies. When we initially provided guidance for 2008, we indicated that we expected to make investments in systems and our start-up in India, which together would reduce full-year EPS by about $0.20. We incurred $0.04 of the impact in Q2 bringing the total for the first half to about $0.07 and now expect to incur about $0.17 per share for the full year. Our lab in India became operational towards the end of the first quarter. We are still in the very early days of ramping up our selling efforts and other support functions. While this market is expected to be a significant contributor to our international operations, we are not expecting it to contribute material revenues this year. Our revised estimate for startup losses this year is about $0.04 per share compared to an initial estimate of about $0.07. We've incurred $0.02 for the first half of the year with $0.01 realized in each of the first two quarters. Our systems investments totaling $0.13 per share associated with developing and deploying standard systems across AmeriPath, and our clinical labs are on track. The deployment of upgraded AmeriPath lab and billing systems is on track and the linking of Care360 with the AmeriPath systems for test results is going well. Additionally, we have made good progress in the development associated with standardizing our clinical lab systems. Through the first half we incurred roughly $0.05 per share, $0.03 in quarter two of the $0.13 per share we expect to spend this year on systems enhancements. Cash from operations increased to $213 million for the quarter compared to $129 million last year. During the quarter we reduced debt by $168 million bringing our total debt reduction since the AmeriPath acquisition to about $700 million. Cash at the end of the quarter was $143 million and capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter. Turning to guidance from continuing operations, we continue to expect revenue growth of about 9%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to approach 17%. We expect cash from operations, to approximate $900 million and we now expect capital expenditures of between $240 million and $260 million. And lastly we have increased the mid-point of our estimate for diluted earnings per share and now expect between $3.10 and $3.20 excluding any potential special charges. While we're in challenging economic times, we continue to make solid progress and reported strong results for the first half. And we expect our continued focus on executing our plans will position us well to achieve both our financial and strategic goals for this year. Now I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bob. We differentiate ourselves and drive profitable growth by providing a superior experience for our patients, physicians and hospitals. This focus is producing results. Now I will provide a brief update on three key areas driving profitable growth, expanding our margins, and building a sustainable platform for long term growth. Our approach to driving profitable growth is to leverage our sales, service and science. We provide value to our new and existing customers with our superior service offering and innovative tests and technologies. Gene-based and esoteric testing revenues increased about 20% in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in a number of esoteric and gene-based tests including Vitamin D and testosterone testing, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests, and ImmunoCAP allergy testing. In addition to our leadership position in gene-based and esoteric testing, we are also the clear leader in Anatomic Pathology. These are the two fastest growing areas of our industry. We perform esoteric and gene-based testing at four major sites; our two Nichols Institute Labs; Focus Diagnostics and specialty laboratory. We are the laboratories laboratory receiving unusual or difficult cases for not only hospital labs, but also academic institutions and other commercial laboratories. Our hospital business is growing and accounts for more than $1 billion in revenue. An example of how we think about solutions to difficult diagnostic challenges is in ovarian cancer. We believe a number of tests based on various markers will be required to help detect and monitor various stages of cancer in different categories of patients. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer related death among women in the U.S., with more than 15,000 deaths and nearly 22,000 new cases diagnosed per year. We are developing test through relationship with three pioneers in proteomics and biomarkers, Fujirebio Diagnostics, Vermillion and CoreLogic. Tomorrow we are launching the first FDA cleared blood test based on Fujirebio's HE4 biomarker. We are the first commercial lab to make this test available to monitor ovarian cancer patients. In addition we are also evaluating the OVA1 ovarian cancer tumor tryst test from Vermillion which filed an application with the FDA in late June. Similarly we are taking a portfolio approach to expand our leadership in colorectal cancer screening. Given that patients compliance with colorectal screening guidelines is poor, tests need to be easy and convenient to take. For several years now we have offered our proprietary InSure FIT test and FDA clear test for colorectal cancer screening with the patient friendly sample collection process. During the quarter, we introduced a clear wave of version of this test called InSure Quick FIT that can be performed in a doctors office. We are also developing the first blood based test to detect colorectal cancer using the Septin 9 methylated biomarker from Epigenomics. Our important cardiac test using Iron Mobility Technology, is the first and only test that directly measures lipo-protein particle size, which is critical to accessing cardiac risk. We're excited about the potential for this unique test, which was a subject of a study of this online recently in the General Clinical Chemistry. In addition, we continue to enhance the patient's experience, our collaboration with Google and Power Spacing to manage their own health information. Using Google Health, people can store their diagnostic test results and other medical information online. We are expanding our operating margins through top line growth and cost savings. We improved underlying margins in each of the last four quarters, and are on track to meet our commitment to reduce our cost structure by $500 million by the end of next year. We have reengineered many of our processes using Six Sigma and Lean principles. We improve efficiency and remove unnecessary work. As a result, we have 1300 fewer people than 12 months ago. We increased productivity while continuing to deliver unmatched service levels to our patients and physicians. Our employees are driving a strong culture of continuous improvement. The quality of our people and their dedication to excellence is a strong differentiator for Quest Diagnostics. Growth is being driven by our physician, hospital and our anatomic pathology businesses. This growth will be supplemented over the longer term by expense on our some near patient testing and international businesses. We continue to see double-digit growth in near patient or point-of-care testing. During the quarter, our HemoCue business obtained a clear waiver for the first quantitative micro albumin point-of-care test. This test enables doctors to detect and monitor a marker for chronic kidney disease that affects 26 million Americans. Also our focused diagnostic business received the CE mark for a new test kit that enabled doctors for the first time to simultaneously detect and differentiate three major parasites connected to diarrhea disease. These parasites are found worldwide, we plan to distribute this kit in Europe and developing nations and to apply for FDA clearance in the U.S. Internationally we continue to build our service capability and add customers in India, which we see as a long term opportunity. In addition, based on our quality and service, the government of Ireland has selected us to perform all five testing for Ireland's first nationwide cervical cancer screening program. We are entering the decade of diagnostics and have tremendous opportunities to use laboratory tests to help Doctors and their patients better manage health and reduce costs. It is gratifying over the past few weeks to see the U.S. Congress recognize the value and importance of laboratory testing. As I am sure you noted, Congress last week passed legislation that deployed [ph] Medicare competitive bidding for laboratory services, eliminated cost cuts from physician fee schedule for 2008, and provided for a 1.1% increase for 2009. In addition, next year the clinical laboratory fee schedule used to determine government reimbursement, will contain a CPI increase of approximately 4.5%. Based on the preliminary analysis, this could increase our revenues up to $40 million in 2009. This is the first CPI increase in five years and only the second in the past 11 years. In summary, diagnostic testing is a very attractive industry. While it is not immune to economic challenges they are far outweighed by the opportunities. Demographics and pace of innovation will continue to drive growth. We are the clear leader and continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our superior service, Six Sigma quality, innovative tests and advanced information technology solutions. Our business is performing well and we are executing our plan. We are bi-focal doing what is right for the business in the short term and planning for the long-term. We're on track to deliver our commitments for 2008 and are well positioned for the future. We'll now take your questions. Operator. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Ricky Goldwasser from UBS.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Good morning. With the sequential volume improvement that you've showed in the second quarter, can you just provide us little more color on the key variables namely that you are gaining back in the business there and pull through. And also as we think about the second half of the year, are there additional tailwinds that would help continue that trend? And then secondly, just to clarify if you can repeat the breakdown of the $0.24 in cost for the year, and is the increase coming from India and if so, if you can give us more detail on that.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Ricky, let me try and get each of those, but first let me clarify one thing, the $0.24 in cost that you mentioned, its $0.17. You may recall we initially indicated we expected to invest $0.20, we've now adjusted that down to $0.17, the change principally coming because we are spending less in India. We're expecting Indian investment to now be $0.04 a share versus the $0.07 that we had initially estimated.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Thank you for clarifying that confusion.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: With respect to volume, basically this is the underlined volume. We'll try to take out the NOIs for you and as we said it has been increasing 1% to 2% over pretty much the last four quarters now. The UHC impact, we've actually decided to stop talking about that because it's less than it has been as you recall. It... we lost most of that business last year in the first quarter, by the end of the first quarter and we didn't plan on spending a lot of time talking about it principally because it's not having a significant impact on the year-over-year comparisons any longer. The impact of volume is less than 1% and the revenue impact is around 1%. With that said though we did retain over 20% of the volume and we've seen no change in the associated pull through with UHC. And in terms of volumes, as you know we don't give guidance for price and volume; but I am encouraged by the fact that we've seen nice steady trends in volume growth, over the last four quarters or so.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Willoughby of Banc of America Securities.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. Bob, can you run through the CapEx numbers were down, did you give a reason why that was off as sharply as it was for the year?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I didn't Robert. We did reduce our estimate for capital spending by about $40 million for the year and mostly that's just prudent management of our capital. There is a little less spend in India, but remember we were anticipating less than 10% of our capital spend this year would be associated with India anyhow. But we already see us managing the capital spend for the year.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: It's a big drop though Bob isn't it, I mean... have you deferred a project of some sort or just...
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No major projects have been deferred, I think they are a lot of things that we were looking at early in the year and want to give ourselves the flexibility in our guidance to be able to do those as result of growing through the cost reduction efforts that we have been. We have been identifying not only ways to reduce the P&L spend but ways to reduce the capital spend as well.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay and just in a better free cash loan environment should we pay down more debts or can we expect the acquisitions sooner than may be you might have planned.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well as you know we have never really ruled out acquisitions, but to the degree that we are generating excess cash flow, as I've said we'll first deploy it right now at least this year to pay down debt, but certainly keep our options open as it relates to potential acquisitions and frankly share repurchases as well.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Yes thanks, good morning. Just to clarify, Surya your comment about the potential revenue impact from the CPI adjustments and I guess a quick question would be what percent of managed care contracts are explicitly tied to Medicare pricing?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's actually 15% of Medicare right?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Medicare represents about 15% of our total revenues.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Right, right, no, I understood, but in terms of terms of the actual managed care contracts some of which...
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: It is very little. Bill there is very little contracting that is actually tied to changes in the pricing for Medicare.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Most of them are fixed fee schedules.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Most of them are fixed fee schedules that are separately negotiated.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Understood. And then secondly Bob, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like your assumptions of bad debt expense are not likely to change, given the economic conditions, did I hear that, I guess that...
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't expect the economy to have a significant impact on either bad debt or our DSO's. As you saw, they've both been improving and a lot of that has to do with our processes that we're executing to try and improve both of those areas. As I mentioned we're making good progress on the AmeriPath side, I am encouraged by that, but additionally we've been executing very well against the rest of our operations. And not only reducing the cost of the billing operations, but really driving down bad debts and DSO's. As I've said in the past, our bad debt is not principally associated with people unwilling or unable to pay, a lot of it is driven by process and when I say process, I'm talking about, we're making sure that we get appropriate and accurate information upfront, to build a patient the first time. When we get that, we have a very high rate of collections.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Don Brock [ph] from JP Morgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the revenue side. You know, you posted a really, really solid quarter on the top line. You've got a number of proprietary products that are doing well, there are higher revenue, higher margin, higher growth more on the esoteric side. Are you looking to see more strength on the top line and because of the product mix and the strength in the mix that you've been talking about actually see some potential upside in margins and earnings may be on the top end of your guidance range?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again I would tell you that I am certainly encouraged by the fact that we're growing not only the underlying volume but the revenue per acquisition and much of that continues to be driven by test mix. The organic growth that we're estimating for the second half of the year, that's built in to our guidance is between 4% and 5%. And we would expect overtime that our goal is to drive growth at or above the rate of the industry, which right now we're estimating is in that 4% to 5% range at the moment.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I just want add one thing, if you remember three years ago we started our strategy to diversify our revenue base and I am really pleased that 34% of our total revenue now comes from esoteric gene based and anatomic pathology. This is the two fastest growing sector in our industry and we have added a lot of proprietary exclusive or have some temporal advantage in the product. So you can see a number of new products that is coming on and the pipeline is going to help us in the long term to accelerate our growth.
Unidentified Analyst: Surya, just as a follow up to that. Are you seeing that the esoteric testing is having a shorter shelf life as far as driving, pricing and margin i.e. that, that pricing doesn't stay as high for as long and may be that's why you're not expecting a significant increase on the revenue side for an extended period of time even though you do have a lot of products in the pipeline?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well it depends on what test and also depends on how the test are accepted by some medical society. You know the important thing, if you see we used 70% of our revenue four years ago routine testing and the most important thing and important strategy for us is to go towards professional component which is anatomic pathology and also the gene-based testing. But it is usually three to four years. They... these test remain as esoteric and then it becomes routine.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: And mind Don [ph] if you think about it, it really comes down to Surya's point on adoption. If we take HPV as a specific example, that was included in the ACOG and ACS guidelines at this point almost four or five years ago and we're still seeing a nice adoption rate on that, so it really is going to depend on the test and the rate of adoption by the practicing physician.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But there is no single test we believe in the portfolio of test and I also believe that we will see in two or three years this approach of portfolio of test proprietary and exclusive is going to give Quest a much stronger position in growing that market.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent and just more on the macro side. Obviously we are not necessarily seeing on the volume side or on the pricing side a significant impact, that's at least clear from the economy, given your results; but the question remains, are you guys even anecdotally seeing any sort of pull back on physician office visits and or the potential adoption of the new products in the office simply because doctor's don't want to push it on patient's that are there for one reason they don't necessarily want to push it any further?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Bob, what is your comment if you see any number then I can then tell you what I see and what I feel?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Don, listen we don't believe we have seen any impact to our volumes for the first half. As we said the underlying volumes have been pretty consistent now for about four quarters and frankly if a patient doesn't come in to a doctor's office, we don't know that. We don't... and even if we did, we wouldn't necessarily understand why. But with that said though, to the degree that volumes do get impacted here, we don't believe they'd necessarily be significant. But, yes, we would certainly be in a position then to further adjust our costs to match the volume levels.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But the sluggish economy is there and we are not immune to that, but there are so many opportunities in diagnostic testing that that particular risk should not really stop our growth. There are new innovations, there's new demographics, and I am very bullish about the diagnostic testing and the value to its healthcare, and what impact it will have for the next ten years.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe, from Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks, just a couple of quick ones. Can you quantify the incremental Aetna in the quarter?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again Aetna has been one of the contributors to our growth but we don't specifically talk about contracts and what each of them contribute but, you should rest assured that yes, Aetna's volumes have continued to grow for us.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, in terms of the AmeriPath integration, is the deal sort of accretive at this point, neutral; I think it was a little bit dilutive last quarter, any benefit there?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, with respect to AmeriPath, what I will tell you is we're actually making very good progress there. We've got good pathology retention, we've renewed or extended a number of contracts, we've got strong customer retention, as we said in the last quarter the specialty integration is complete. We've begun integrating the sales force and as you have heard earlier, we're making very good progress on the bad debt. With that said, we haven't broken out the AmeriPath impact because it's starting now to become part of one business and we haven't done that for any other acquisitions in the past and wouldn't expect to do that for this one. But with that said, overtime we expect this to be an accretive acquisition principally because we expect to accelerate growth there. We are making good progress on the cost synergy side and we are starting to get all the things in place right now to position us to accelerate the growth.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, fair enough and then just my last one, in terms of, in India it looks like you guys are looking for a loss of $0.04 or I guess a $0.07 loss estimate. Is that just the operations there proving ahead of schedule or is it sort of something where the incremental costs are going to kind of carried over, as we think about sort of 2009?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the change for this year is really just a function of how quick we are building out the infrastructure. The business is ramping a little slower than we had initially anticipated. Therefore the investments and infrastructure are going at a slower place. But we are still targeting the break even before the end of 2010 and we're very excited about the opportunities. I wouldn't expect that next year and we haven't yet given guidance for next year, but next year's investment will be significantly different than what we initially estimated for this year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay, fair enough, thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Adam Feinstein from Lehman Brothers.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you, good morning everyone. Just I guess a few questions here, Bob I understand you don't want to break out AmeriPath separately because now you view it as being a part of one company, but just could you just talk roughly around the bad debt expense for... if you could give us what the standalone bad debt expense is or just a rough ballpark in terms of what the AmeriPath bad debt expense is. It sounds like you're making progress, but just trying to get better sense in terms of the magnitude. So I was just curious if you can provide any feedback about the bad debt at the AmeriPath side?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, on the AmeriPath side for the quarter it contributed about four tenths of a percent increase to our bad... to our consolidated bad debt rate, and in the first quarter it was about six tenths of a percent impact.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. And then with respect to Aetna, if I hear you correctly, that contract kicked in July 1st of last year, so should we expect a little bit lower growth in the back half of 2008, since you have now annualized that or really move the growth rate?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, certainly it will impact the comparisons year-over-year as we get in to the second half.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, so we will factor that in. Okay, and then just on the cost cutting side, as you talked about the $200 million and I understand that you don't want to give a specific number every quarter, but just as we think about just a ramp up, should we think about being more backend loaded or pretty equal throughout the year. How are you viewing the $200 million benefit for 2008?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Without getting too specific Adam, it does tend to ramp up on... not quite as straight line basis, but it's not all backend loaded. We have to get a lot of it last year, so that we had a good solid run-rate coming in to this year and we continue to make progress on that good solid study progress on that.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: And keep in mind that, that's a $200 million... incremental $200 million run-rate as we exit the year.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Got you, okay. And then just my final question, Surya you mentioned about 34% of the business now coming from the esoteric and gene-based testing, so just as you think about that, that number going forward, do you see that number moving higher and I guess, you'll probably say yes, but just curious in terms of just the magnitude?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you answered my question. Yes, it is going to grow and you can see from our progress. We've been adding a lot of new tests, some of them our proprietary, some of them are exclusive. We have also gone towards disease solutions rather than just one test. So when we said that we're going to do this thing, people said well we can't really grow and now we have 34% coming from two fastest growing sectors. So I expect that we are going to grow that sector as we go forward.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Adam just one another thing to keep in mind is typically a test starts out as esoteric and overtime if we're lucky actually it becomes routine because that's when the volumes pickup and it becomes much more wide to accept it. So the rate at which we've been growing, what we will call today the esoteric revenues. We'll continue at the same rate, because those things sometimes become routine in nature. So there is going to be a natural limit on what percentage of our total revenues can come from, routine... come from esoteric testing.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But, the reason why we acquired AmeriPath and we said we are the clear leader and the number one cancer diagnostics company, because anatomic pathology is a very important sector and that's going to grow as you people age and so you have leadership in clinical pathology, you have leadership in anatomic pathology, and you have leadership in esoteric testing. So, I expect that our strategy is going to continue to push, that section and we will go more and more towards our goal of expanding our margins, both from top line growth and the cost reduction.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Kemp Dolliver from Cowen & Company.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Hi thanks. Just a couple of questions on the AmeriPath related projects. First, with specialty, what functions and did you... are actually integrated now and then secondly with the sales force training, just give us some color on the sales force structure now that you've put the organizations together? Thanks.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, specialty is part of our hospital business. So all the hospital channels, sales channel is completely integrated. Specialty is also part of the four large esoteric centers we have which is the two Nichols Institute and Focused Diagnostics. So from operation point of view and also from sales point of view, we're very pleased that integration is complete. We mentioned about how we are doing the cross selling in anatomic pathology especially dermatopathology and that particular program has started and we are training our physician sales people to bring the leads to our dermatopathology group. And as we go on we will let you know how that goes but we are very encouraged, the way the physicians respond to this and we have some oddly wins.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: That's great. Thank you.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Kemp.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Bonello from Wachovia.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Good morning, a couple of questions. So, can you just elaborate a little bit Bob in terms of taking your guidance, raising the low end, it looks like about $0.03 of that came from the lower India cost, is the rest of that due to a better outlook for operations or is it really just a reflection of greater cash flow and lower interest expense?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly $0.03 of it was the investments and as you recall, I mentioned there was another penny in the tax rate in the second quarter. But with that said, the outlook that we have for the back half of the year really hasn't changed. We are tracking our plan for the year, we feel good about the progress we are making, and some of the improvement certainly is from operations and we would hope to continue to drive the improve there as the year progresses.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay and then just, if I look at your guidance it's sort of implicit in that that even if you got to the high end of the range is that Q3 and Q4 would be flat to down sequentially and I know there is about $0.03 of more investment cost in the back half than in the front half, but why else wouldn't we see more growth in the back half of the year?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well remember the $0.10 that we are talking about in the back half compares to $0.07in the first half, but compares to practically nothing in last year's back half. So you've got to factor that in there. And as I said, the outlook for the back half of the year really hasn't changed for us.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, great, but still I get the point about $0.10 verses nothing last year but if... I am just thinking about your Q3 and Q4 EPS relative to your Q2 EPS, is there a reason that we wouldn't see sequential growth from Q2?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You've got to be a little careful just looking at a quarter-to-quarter. The quarters have their own sort of seasonality attached to them and at times can be a little choppy. But I think the best thing to do now is really look at our business on a full year basis because the components of the business have changed too, and what we historically saw as some of the trends between Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are starting to change a little bit.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then the last question would just be... just because someone was pressing you on that esoteric issue, did caps fall out of the esoteric bucket, is that what you were saying or once the test is classified as esoteric, does it count towards that volume forever?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well certainly nothing fell out of the bucket this quarter. And what I was trying to say earlier was it doesn't stay... sometimes it doesn't stay esoteric for the long term. What is esoteric today might become routine in the future. So, we would classify, out of the esoteric bucket. We typically do that once a year though, we don't do that on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Hi good morning, couple of questions. In terms of the 1% to 2% underlying volume growth rate, how do you expect that to ramp or do you expect that to ramp in the longer term, and how does that compare to the overall industry growth rate?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: From an industry perspective Amanda we really don't have good industry data that would tell us between the components of revenue and revenue for acquisition and volume. Keep in mind the way we count volume is not the number of tests it is the number of patients we serve. So we think the best way to look at this is on a revenue basis. What we see right now as Bob indicated earlier, we think revenue for the industry is at about 5%. We think that we're tracking about on that and we would expect over time that you would see us to grow revenues above the industry rate.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay, and then in terms of volumes in the second half, now that you have reached the Aetna anniversary, what initiatives do you have in place to grow volume in U.S. in the second half?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, as I said the way we increase our revenue that will leverage our sales, service, and science and we have made some changes in our sales tactics and most of our sales people are now selling rather than trying to reduce confusion in the marketplace. And we have number of new tests, and we are educating the doctors. We have now, most of the managed care contracts. So, in fact their productivities are higher. So, that's going to... that is helping us to increase our penetration in the marketplace.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay. And then in terms of India and now that you have a couple of quarters are still behind you, can you provide some updates on the utilization or reimbursement trends and also what else, if anything has surprised you about the operating environment relative to U.S.?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well first of all, let's remember why we went to India, okay. There are 300 million middle class there and almost the same population in United States. But going to an international country and starting from scratch is going to take sometime. We've been very prudent how we establish ourselves. So we want to establish a company of highest quality and ethics and technology and we have now established our laboratories, our operations in charge, we have got a number of hospital contracts. So its moving in the right direction. Now for me it could move little faster, but obviously we're taking a course of step to establish our position in Delhi, in the Central Delhi area and once that is successful then we'll go to the other areas in India. What surprises me, it's difficult to hire the right people and the amount of people, so it's taking a little bit of time, but there are no real operational surprises and as far as reimbursement is concerned most of the payments are in out of pocket expenses. Some insurers but not like in this countries, they are not major health plans there. So it is a market which is going to be very helpful to us and as I said that as we grow our core business, India and point-of-care is going to help us in three to four years, significant to expand our position in the world.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Borsh from Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi thank you, this is Shelley [ph] now on behalf of Matt Borsh this morning. A couple of quick questions, first, I was wondering if there was any specific initiatives around cost cutting that maybe were accelerated or introduced that allowed you to offset the drug screening business, may be pressure from rising fuel costs, etcetera?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A couple of things Shelley. Certainly as I mentioned we accelerated some efforts on the billing and collection side which have improved both bad debt and DSOs during the last quarter. And we feel very good about that and that's across the company, that's not just in the drugs-of-abuse testing business. In the drugs-of-abuse testing business we had identified a number of areas that we wanted to target even prior to the slowdown as part of our program to reduce costs by $500 million and some of those are frankly when we saw a slowdown we looked to accelerate. In fact, we consolidated the number of laboratories that we do our drugs-of-abuse testing in and we've actually adjusted some of the other costs as well, as we saw changes in the volume. So it's not as though it's easy to do but I think we took... we made the difficult decisions and took quick action there when we saw the volumes changing and accelerate some of the things that we had already keyed up.
Unidentified Analyst: And that's, and more broadly said we saw some pretty significant improvement in both cost of sales and the SG&A lines. Despite a slowing economy, despite some slowdown in volumes from the drug screening business, we had highlighted some potential pressure from fuel costs, and so I was just wondering if some of those initiatives had been accelerated on purpose because of the slowing economy and in particular are there other levers that could be pulled if volumes see any slowdown in the back half of the year?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well you mentioned fuel, let me just comment on that. Our fuel consumption is actually down about 10% from what it was a year ago principally because of all the actions that we have been taking, which is to basically restructure some of our routes to convert to what fuel efficient vehicles, to eliminate non-productive staffs. So that was actually a big save for us but I wouldn't say that we accelerated that. That is something that we had planned and it turned out that we had a point that a good time given the rising costs of fuel at this point. But, yes I would tell you that the plans that we've got laid-out, for the most part the timing of them is a pretty much set, although there are things that we can continue to do. You recall last year in the first quarter when we had to pull out some significant costs associated with the volume changes from United we did that over the course of about two quarters. And by the time we got to the third quarter of last year the underlying margins were back to where they were the year before. So this is something that we can do if required to, but yes, as we do it obviously we want to keep an eye on the service levels and make sure that we continue to maintain the service levels that we have, just like we have over the course of the last year or so, as we can pull the cost out.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then also given that there have been productivity enhancements that have... sounds like they have contributed to have reduced headcount was wondering couple of things, could you give us 1300 fewer people have been cut since the year ago, can you tell us roughly what percent of your headcount that is? And then secondarily as you've increased productivity, has there been any increase in staff turnover from the early part of 2007, is it... is there more pressure on the staff as they have work harder or work more?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well one thing to give you a sense, as Surya said earlier, this isn't about asking people to do more, it's about eliminating unnecessary work and that what's Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma are all about. And that's really what's enabled us to reduce 1300 people out of about a little over 40,000 in total, roughly 43000 employees is what we have got. With that said, we have been doing most of that through voluntary attrition. We have voluntary turnover of about 6000 people each year and that's what we're doing, what we're using to manage most of the workforce reductions where we can.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But, you know as I said that our people have been really great. Their quality and their culture and their dedication to excellence is really removing the unnecessary works, but also driving the culture of continuous improvement. So credit goes to all the people who have been really working and making sure that our productivity goes up and even though we have less people. So we don't use the word cost cutting, we take away unnecessary work.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then just two more quick one's if I could; wondering if the new guidance range takes into account potential increased pressure from suppliers raising prices, we've seen thermo electronic couple [ph], we just go talking about some price hikes, could the new guidance range take... is it broad enough to take into account any increased pricing from your suppliers?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: First of all the majority of our supplier contracts are fixed costs, so that the prices are fixed over the term of the contract. So there's not a lot that we see in terms of changes as a result of that. With that said, certainly our guidance would anticipate any changes that we'd expect on the cost side.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then one quick housekeeping, the tax rate was better than expected at the second quarter, run rate expectations for the year?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I wouldn't necessarily change the run rate. Remember I mentioned that we had resolved some tax contingencies in the quarter, and that's why the quarter's rate was lower than it had been.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, okay, thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Gary Taylor from Citigroup.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Hi good morning. I think what you are seeing on the tax rate is we ought to a move back to where it was before this quarter, correct?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay and can you provide your balance sheet allowance today or do we need to wait for the Q for that?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: The Q will be filed yes, this week which will have the reserve numbers on it, but keep in mind, DSO's came down and it was driven by collections.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay and then finally, can you just remind us what impact you are expecting out from Lab One in the United contract?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: As we've indicated coming into the year the Lab One really represents less than $10 million in revenues under UNH contract so, any risk there is pretty limited.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: And the timing of that was the middle of the year some time I thought...
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: It was during the second quarter and as Bob indicated exiting the quarter we retained over 20% of the United business.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, so that includes... that's specific for Lab One or that's just total on the United?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Its inclusive, the 20% is included.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: But you've already seen of that impact in these...
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Already last year.
Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Gallucci from Merrill Lynch.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Good morning thanks for taking all the time, nonetheless, not a lot left on my end but just a couple of quick ones. Esoteric growth, I know you talked a little bit about the percentage business, but what was the growth in the quarter?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Almost 20%.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: And then what about, does that include AmeriPath, so is this sort of an organic number?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: The organic number is double-digit.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then I know you're not talking about guidance for '09, you mentioned India may be sort similar to expense as this year. IT, the resource rate and concepts rates expect that to be less next year than this year, is that on track?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You should expect it to generally be a little less next year. I mean, we're still be deploying some of the standard systems, as we get in to next year, so there still be some IT investment, but I expect that it would be somewhat less than this year's.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just a last question on pathology. You're talking about some of the integration of the sales force there. We read a little bit here and there about some start ups, venture capital money, pathology seems to be sort of a hot area. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in pathology and if you're seeing anything significant there in terms of change?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know Tom pathology is a hot area. That's the reason why we went and acquired AmeriPath and added their business to our business and we have now 800 of MDs here. I think as people get older and the demographic changes, more and more going towards anatomic pathology and cancer diagnostics, so they are just keen whether it is colorectal, whether its breast, whether its ovarian cancer. So I feel very confident having the luminaries we have and having the people we have in the company, they are guiding us to do what is right thing for the patients and the health plans and the employers. So I think from the comparative spread yes there will be some venture people, there will be... some pathologists go from one place to the other, but in reality, you have to have a very strong infrastructure to serve these professional group of people. Starting from managed care contract to have strong IT, logistics, reporting, and that's the advantage of Quest Diagnostics, that we have a very strong base and foundation from which professional services can be delivered. So I am pretty excited about it.
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And what Surya just described is basically we're trying to create company that'll be very attractive for pathologists to come and join and to the degree that there are changes in ownership in some of these companies that might create further opportunity for us to attract some of those pathologists.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Andthen one last question Bob, you've mentioned maybe some changes in historical seasonal patterns. Could you just expand on the type of things you are seeing there as opposed to I think historically we always saw the first half was stronger than the second half revenue wise?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, for example last year our fourth quarter I think from an EPS standpoint was probably our strongest quarter of the year. Now some of that was due to the fact that we were dealing with the UHC change in the first quarter. But we've added some new businesses, the AmeriPath business is a little different than the rest of our business was in terms of the way that cycles through the year. The risk assessment business is a little different and the drugs-of-abuse testing business has its own seasonality attached to it. So without trying to get in to giving you a specific quarterly guidance because you remember we got away from that a while ago, I want to caution everyone to use... to not necessarily use the historical patterns that we saw quarter-to-quarter and project that out.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: May be just to clarify that, it sounds like you described the things that are more changes in your mix of businesses as opposed to any real changes in the underlying seasonality of the historical sort of core lab businesses. Is that correct?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Gurda from Leerink Swann.
Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann: Thank you. Most of my questions have already been answered, but I just wanted to follow up on earlier question which was related to the CPI increases for the next year. Besides Medicare, what other if any sources of revenue do you have that are tied to the... or directly tied to the like CPI type increase?
Robert Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In some of our contracts we have fixed fee increases. In some cases they may be tied to CPI, in another cases they are negotiated fee increases, but I would say that there are limited changes associated with the CPI outside of Medicare.
Jason Gurda - Leerink Swann: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Robert Willoughby of Banc of America Securities.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Just a follow up on the Google relationship. Can you speak to the economics there, I am trying to figure out why you would give somebody access to the data since that is such an attractive asset?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: The person who gets the access to the data is the patient. That's who gets the access and that's the person whose data it is.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: That's true, are you paying to put the data into the Google database or are they paying you?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Robert let me first of all tell you, we are doing this thing as a series of activities we're doing to empower patients, that's going to help the patients and the physician and also the health plan. Remember here we do provide some medical records, the print records to the patient in some states. And what goggle relationship is doing is actually helping the patients to go to the doctor and say interrogating a paper work can I really put it in this place. No we don't pay to put the patient data and again we do a number of things to improve our stickiness and our relationship with the patients and the payers and this is another project which we are doing to improve our differentiation from our competitors.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay, thank you.

Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.:
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Laure. During the quarter, we delivered strong growth in revenues and earnings. Consolidated revenues grew 17% to $1.8 billion, earnings per share increased 31%, and cash flow was $158 million for the quarter. During the quarter we also made good progress in all elements of our plan. We drove profitable organic revenue growth. We further aligned AmeriPath with Quest Diagnostics. We generated double-digit revenue growth in our near-patient or point-of-care testing business. We continued to reduce our cost structure and improve our efficiency. We opened our lab in India, which is a key market for our international business. And we were the only company in our industry to be named one of America's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine. After we hear from Bob, I will address each of these elements. Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Surya. As you heard, we continue to make solid progress against our plan, and are on track to meet the goals we established for the year. As I take you through the numbers, I'll elaborate on the areas of progress Surya highlighted. Before I do, I'll quickly address NID. We are continuing with our discussions with the government to attempt to settle this matter. We have made no adjustments to our reserve and have no updates to the status we provided you in February. Now, let's turn to the results. Revenues were $1.8 billion, 16.9% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing about 13% growth. Revenues for our clinical testing business, which account for over 90% of our total revenues, were 17.1% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing about 14%. Volume was 5.6% above the prior year and essentially even with the prior year, before the AmeriPath acquisition. This reflects continued growth in our underlying business, adjusted for the United contract change. Remember, that change went into effect January first of last year, and most of the volume loss ramped up over the course of last year's first quarter. Therefore, there continues to be about a 1.5% carry-over impact in comparing this year's first quarter volume to that of last year. During the first quarter, there was a positive impact to the year-over-year revenue per requisition comparison of about 0.5% due to higher reimbursement on the retained United work, which brings the year-over-year revenue impact of the contract change to about 1%. Since most of the volume impact was felt by the end of last year's first quarter, and since there continues to be no significant change in the amount of the United volume we have retained… over 20%, we expect a more limited impact on future quarterly volume and revenue comparisons. Revenue per requisition increased 10.8%, with 7.8% of the increase due to AmeriPath. The balance of the increase in revenue per requisition, about 3%, continues to be primarily driven by a positive mix, partially offset by price reductions on various health plan contracts. This 3% increase compares to an increase of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference is due to the anniversary of the positive price impact of the United contract change and pricing reductions negotiated last year, which went into effect January 1 of this year. As we've previously explained, all of our largest health plan contracts have now been renegotiated for multi-year periods, and we believe there is much more stability in pricing than a year ago. Adjusted for last year's contract losses, we continue to see growth in our base volume of between 1% and 2%, similar to the Q4 level. This is despite seeing a significant decline, almost 10%, in pre-employment drug testing, which accounts for about 7% of our total volume. Given that this tends to be very low-priced business, the impact to revenue and profitability is generally much less. Our drug testing business and our risk assessment business, which serves life insurers, are our two businesses most subject to a slowing economy. We expect both of these businesses to see their growth impacted this year and are taking actions to manage their costs accordingly. However, please note that these businesses, combined, account for less than 10% of our total revenues. Given our actions to manage their costs, we do not expect their performance to alter our consolidated revenue or earnings expectations for the year. And lastly, on the topic of revenue growth. We saw strong, double digit growth, in each of our, point-of-care, clinical trials and healthcare IT businesses in the quarter. You'll hear more from Surya on the point-of-care business. Included in footnote four to the earnings release is a table, which summarizes the impact to various revenue measures for a number of the items discussed. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15.7% for the quarter, up 2.5% percent from last year's first quarter, principally due to the actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure. This percentage is below the level we exited last year, primarily due to annual salary and wage adjustments, which go into effect in the first quarter, a seasonal increase in bad debt, as well as pricing reductions, which went into effect January first. However, we expect that our operating income percentage will continue reflecting improvement over the prior year in each of the next three quarters, due to continued revenue growth and further savings from our cost reduction program initiated last year. That program, which we expect to reduce our cost structure by $500 million as we exit 2009, delivered over $100 million in savings as we exited last year; and we expect to have realized about half of the remainder as we exit this year. The largest component of the savings will come from streamlining processes and increasing productivity in our labs by deploying Lean Six Sigma. The first deployment of Lean is now complete and has been fully analyzed. The analysis has confirmed significant productivity gains, double digits in most of the impacted departments, exceeding our initial estimates. We are now utilizing the learnings from this first deployment to ensure we maximize the returns and facilitate the deployment of Lean to our other labs around the country. The other major elements of our program, which contribute substantial savings include: Driving more of our purchasing through master contracts to take advantage of our scale; deploying enhanced connectivity to our customers and patient service centers, which helps reduce costs in specimen data entry and billing, and helps lower our bad debt; driving efficiencies in other areas by better aligning our service capacity with patient and sample flows; and, improving the efficiency of our logistics routes using advanced route optimization tools and other techniques. We are seeing good progress across all of these areas. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.8%, up four-tenths of a percent from the first quarter last year, but down three-tenths before the inclusion of AmeriPath. The slight increase from the fourth quarter rate of 4.4% is due to the typical increase we see in the first quarter associated with patient deductibles and co-pays. We do not anticipate any significant impact to our bad debt rate as a result of an economic slowdown. The higher bad debt rate carried by AmeriPath continues to be an opportunity, which we expect to begin realizing later this year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.72 compared to $0.55 in the prior year. Last year's first quarter EPS was reduced by $0.04 of special charges, principally due to workforce reductions. In providing guidance for 2008 we indicated that we expected to make investments in systems and our start-up in India, which together would reduce full-year EPS by about $0.20. We are on track with both of these initiatives and have incurred about $0.03 of the impact in Q1. Our lab in India, in the New Delhi region, is now operational. We are in the early days of ramping up our selling efforts and other support functions. While this market is expected to be a significant contributor to our international operations, the revenue we expect to realize this year is less than $10 million. Our estimate for startup losses this year of about $0.07 per share is unchanged, with $0.01 of that realized in the first quarter. Our systems investments totaling $0.13 per share, associated with developing and deploying standard systems across AmeriPath and our clinical labs, are also on track. We have completed the enhancements to the AmeriPath Lab and billing systems and plan to begin deployment in the second quarter. Additionally, the linking of Care360 with the AmeriPath systems for test results is on track, with completion expected by the end of the second quarter. We expect the initial development associated with the standardization of our clinical lab systems to be completed in the second quarter, with deployment of the enhanced system to begin shortly thereafter. The remaining development is expected to be completed around yearend. Through the first quarter, we incurred about roughly $0.02 of the $0.13 per share we expect to spend this year. Cash from operations for the quarter was $158 million, compared to $152 million last year. Keep in mind, the first quarter cash from operations is typically lower than the quarterly average due to the timing of various cash flows. During the quarter we reduced debt by $113 million, bringing our total debt reduction since the AmeriPath acquisition to more than $500 million. Cash at the end of the quarter was $170 million, and capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter. Day sales outstanding were 48 days, unchanged from yearend. Turning to guidance for results from continuing operations. Full year 2008 guidance is unchanged from what we provided you in February. We expect revenue growth to approximate 9%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to approach 17%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $900 million. And we expect capital expenditures of between $280 million and $300 million. And lastly, we expect diluted earnings per share to be between $3 and $3.20, excluding any potential special charges. While there is still much more to accomplish this year, we've gotten off to a very solid start, and our confidence in achieving our goals, financial and strategic, continues to grow with each milestone achieved. Now, I'll turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bob. During the quarter we drove profitable organic revenue growth, leveraging our sales, service and science. As Bob said, revenues for our clinical testing business were up 17% year-over-year. We are working closely with health plans, and offering them a series of unique services to meet their requirements. For example, with Aetna, we have been communicating to patients the benefits of our unique appointment scheduling service. Patients appreciate the convenience, and their employers like the fact that their employees can remain productive if they use Quest Diagnostics. With CIGNA, we have recently launched a program to educate physicians about the benefits of h. pylori testing for early detection of digestive disorders. Previous programs have focused on expanding colorectal cancer screening using our proprietary InSure test. With Wellpoint, we continue to promote e-prescribing in a pilot using our Care360 physician portal, which combines prescribing and laboratory data. E-prescribing can reduce medical errors and costs, avoid dangerous drug interactions and drive appropriate drug utilization. These service offerings are unique to Quest Diagnostics and available to help regional and national health plans improve patients' health and manage costs for their customers. We continue to grow our esoteric testing services. Gene-based and esoteric testing revenues increased over 20% in the quarter. We are seeing strong growth in HIV, Cystic Fibrosis and tests using tandem aspects such as Vitamin D and testosterone tests. We are also excited that we are providing physicians the gold standard proprietary test for kidney stone evaluations, UroRisk and StoneRisk. Also, during the quarter we licensed a promising new biomarker from Epigenomics for a future colorectal cancer test from a blood samples. Our unique proprietary tests and service offerings are helping us grow our hospital business. We won a number of new hospital and commercial lab accounts during the quarter. Hospitals and other commercial labs value our superior our service, quality and comprehensive testing menu. We are in the process of aligning AmeriPath and Quest Diagnostics. In the quarter, we completed the integration of Specialty Labs, AmeriPath's esoteric testing business. We have engaged the pathologists in the process, and together we are executing our growth plans for anatomic pathology. We have extended a key health plan contract. And we are leveraging our physician sales force to sell the AmeriPath value propositions to primary care physicians, who represent a major growth opportunity for us. We are moving with deliberate speed and the integration is on track. Our near-patient testing revenues grew double digits. Near-person testing is providing exciting opportunities to improve care and reduce cost by enabling physicians to make more timely treatment decisions for the patient at the point of care. We expect new product launches from our HemoCue, Focus Diagnostics and Enterix operations to drive further growth. For example, HemoCue's recently FDA-cleared handheld white blood cell monitor has the potential to change medical practice, by enabling physicians to diagnose infection, inflammation and other serious conditions at the point of care. We are currently waiting for a CLIA waiver, which will greatly expand access for this test. Similarly, Focus Diagnostics is awaiting a CLIA waiver for its HerpeSelect Express Test. This test can quickly and accurately diagnose a herpes infection, allowing the physician to make any immediate treatment decision while the patient is still in the office. We recently launched a physician office version of the InSure Fecal Immunochemical Test for colorectal cancer screening. This product provides physicians with the ability to generate the test results in their office, which has the potential to increase patient compliance. In conjunction with the test, we also launched an exciting education and awareness campaign to promote the benefits of early detection of colorectal cancer. We set an ambitious goal of reaching five million people over age 50 within the next five years. And I would like to invite each of you to join me in our challenge to increase early detection by visiting www.DoYouHaveTheGuts.com. We're expanding our international business by entering the Indian market. Today India is an underserved healthcare market. It is fast growing with a diversified customer base. India has surpassed China as the most popular site for clinical trials in Asia. Our lab in the New Delhi region is operational. We have begun to sign contracts with customers, and build a business focused on esoteric testing, clinical trials, risk assessment and near-patient testing. We are at the very early stage, and continue to believe that this is a significant opportunity. Before closing, I will briefly comment on recent developments associated with the CMS competitive bidding process. As I'm sure, most of you know, the competitive bidding pilot in San Diego was successfully challenged by the local hospitals. In granting the preliminary injunction, the judge expressed concern about the quality of patient care if the pilot were to move forward. We continue to believe that competitive bidding is not appropriate for laboratory services. In summary, we are focused on execution and our approach is bifocal. We are committed to deliver results in the short-term, while building sustainable shareholder value for the long-term. Last year, we took many bold and decisive actions to reduce uncertainty in this industry, and we also built the platform for our growth this year and beyond. During the quarter, we made good progress in all elements of our operating and strategic plans. In particular, we generated strong top and bottom-line growth with our revenues increasing 17% year-over-year. Our cost reduction initiative is in full swing and we are on track to achieve our goal of reducing our cost structure by $500 million by the time we exit 2009. And we are on track to deliver our commitments for 2008. We'll now take your questions. Operator? Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Art Henderson of Jefferies & Company. Sir, you may ask your question.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Hi. Good morning, very nice quarter. Couple of follow-up questions. Bob, you had sort of discussed a little bit, if the economy took a real downturn here, what the exposure would be? If I'm understanding you correctly, less than 10% of your business you really consider to be more discretionary in nature, drug testing and if you could just sort of elaborate on that a little bit more?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. As I mentioned, we've two businesses that are really most subject to an economic downturn, that being the drug testing business which is really pre-employment drug testing and our risk assessment business, which does testing for the life insurance industry. And both of those businesses are already feeling the effects and we're starting to address their cost structures. As I said, combined they account for about little less than 10% of our total revenues. And we don't believe that there is anything in their outlook that would cause us to change the guidance for those two. When you think about the rest of our business, the physician business, the hospital business, et cetera, where the effects of the economy generally would show up there, would be in our volumes. Volumes generally move in line with physician office visits. We don't believe we saw any impact to volumes in Q1. The underlying volume that we saw in Q1 is consistent with what we saw in Q4 and throughout the second half last year, we saw the underlying volume growing. However, if a patient doesn't come into a physicians office, we're not really sure why, quite frankly. But to the degree that we see any impact on the physician side of the business, we don't believe that it will be significant nor cause us to be outside the guidance that we put. And frankly, we would have to think about doing some further adjustments to the cost structure if we saw that. But at this point, we're not anticipating any significant changes there.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: So, we wouldn't need to worry about any stickup in bad debt expense as far as self-pay goes?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. Bad debt is mostly driven by the quality of the billing information we get and not inability of people to pay us. We don't expect the economy to be a significant impact on our bad debt, unlike hospitals, because the vast majority of the testing that we do is actually for insured patients.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, great. That's helpful. One last question and I'll jump back in the queue. You indicated that you spent about… looks like about $0.03, well, actually it looks like about $0.04 of the $0.20 during the quarter or actually $0.03 I guess it was $0.03 of the $0.20. How should we think about that for the remaining few quarters? I know you'll give quarterly guidance, but is that spread equally or front-loaded, how should we think about that, Bob?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I want to stay away from trying to give you guidance on that since we don't give quarterly guidance. But obviously, since we only spent $0.03 in the first quarter, you'd expect that the rate of spend in the rest of the year is going to be higher than what we had in the first quarter. And frankly, how much hits in the second, third and fourth is really going to be a function of a number of things, including how fast we can actually complete the development and then deploy some systems changes.
Arthur Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Feinstein of Lehman Brothers. Sir, your line is open.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you. Good morning everyone. Just a couple of housekeeping questions. Bob did you say that the bad debt expense excluding AmeriPath would have been down about 30 basis points, did I hear you correctly? Okay. And then as we think about bad debt, I mean, what sort of goal do you guys have there so as we think about any sort of goal that you could outline whether it's a shorter term or a longer term goal in terms of where you would like bad debt to be?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Obviously, we would want it to be lower, right? And the big opportunity for us right now is reducing AmeriPath's bad debt, which we expect we will be able to start making progress on this year and we'd expect to see that starting to ramp down as the year goes by. But also, when you look at our $500 million cost reduction program, a significant portion of that is reduced bad debt as well. That's a function of deploying more electronic connectivity, which gives us better billing information, doing some things in our billing shop, using some Six Sigma processes, et cetera. So, I want to stay away from giving a specific target for bad debt, something that we believe we can continually start to dry down. It's a big opportunity for us even when we're at 4%.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then, just a follow-up question here, just on the managed care contracting side. Clearly, last year was a difficult year, lot more stability this year. But, in your opening comments, you had mentioned that there was some price reduction that took effect on January 1st. Just curious to get an update in terms of the managed care landscape, would you guys say you're more upbeat, more cautious there, and then just curious, any updates in terms of some of the newer contracts that you signed at the end of 2007?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Adam, as I said, last year was a challenging year. But we took a lot of decisive action and we feel very good about our relationship with health plans and as you heard that we have a number of unique services we offer and we are working with all the large and smaller health plans to help them to reduce their cost by providing some unique services. So last year is gone and we feel better.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And certainly price is much more stable than it was a year ago.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then just, and this maybe a difficult one to answer. But just on the CRF business any update in terms of what UNH tends to do with that piece of business?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: At this point in time clearly what we've seen is the letter that's been sent to the physicians, which would indicate obviously that they need to take care of some matters related to those physicians, those members, too Humana, and so we're watching this closely.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But you know, we still have retained some United business, and as you know our AmeriPath subsidiary extended their contract with United.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of UBS, your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Good morning. A couple of questions. First of all on the volume growth of the 152% on a normalize basis, is this in line with your expectations, perhaps the internal expectation that you have and do you expect that metric to reaccelerate as we progress in the year?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly volume is tracking where it is. It's in the range of where we thought it would be at this point, and it's certainly one of the things that we're focused on and our plan is to try and ramp that up as the year progresses.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And you said in terms on focusing, are you deploying more sales people into the force, can you just give us a little bit of color, how you going to get volume growth back?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again it's not necessarily adding sales people, but if you look at last year what was going on, we had the sales force very focused on explaining contract changes. And when they get in front of our physician we rather see them selling than explain changes in contracts and that's essentially what we are doing here, getting the sales force back to selling. We started to see that last year in the second half of a year and that's when the volumes start to improve. We've continually seen growth in the underlined volume, and our plan is to continue to see that over the course of the year.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ricky also we have introduced a lot of proprietary products and some of those products are doing very well, whether it is InSure or whether it is a Lumeta [ph] or other which is now is going to be the Uro… And UroRisk and StoneRisk. So we continue our diversification towards higher margin, higher growth, esoteric gene based testing and AP, so that's also helping us.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And in terms of the impacts, sorry just to follow-up on that. In terms of the impact to pricing can you quantify to us what was the contribution to pricing from kind of that shift towards more proprietary products?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we don't break into that. Yeah, as you know its not just one product, but Bob do you want to make any comment.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Rick as I said in my remarks, most of the increase really came from mix, some of that mix had to deal with the fact that the United Contract changes starting to anniversary and the big benefit that we're getting on pricing there is actually going away a little bit. But on the other hand we continued to sell a lot of esoteric and gene-based test which carry higher reimbursement rates and that's been improving, the revenue per requisition and we expect revenue per requisition to continue to be positive through out the year, driven principally by the fact that we're selling new tests and a better test mix. The other thing I would ask you to keep in mind is, we got away from giving specific guidance for volume and revenue per requisition, because essentially what we're looking to do is accelerate revenue growth. And sometimes that means you focus on one of the two elements and at the expense of the other potentially. But our focus is all about profitable revenue growth. And yeah, I'd caution everybody not to focus too much on quarter-to-quarter... slight quarter-to-quarter swings in either the volume or the revenue per requisition.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: And then, two last questions, first on physician fee schedule. Does your current guidance assume that reimbursement changes post June? And then if you can just remind us, what percent of patients use your drawing centers versus samples taken at doc office, and also what's the process there? So if a patient who actually use the Quest drawing center, do you basically take their credit card information or just if you can walk us through that?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: First up on the physician fee schedule, we're not assuming any changes in the physician fee schedule. As we go into the back half of the year, we're assuming that basically the fixed stays in place. On the PSC side, we've got about a third of our volume is coming into the patient service centers, and clearly, you're right that when they're coming in through the patient service center, we're really able to ensure the accuracy of the billing information, and where appropriate and calculable, we can collect payments as well. But the big key is we can make sure we have good billing information and good clean information at that point of service.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks. Just a quick question on organic growth just so I know that I've understood you correctly. It sounds like United, basically about a percentage point overall, taking into account, sort of, you know, pricing and volume, so in looking at organic growth, roughly 5% for the quarter, is that fair?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's actually a little less than that.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And I guess, is there anything noteworthy from whether it'd be incremental Aetna or loss to CIGNA or weather impact, anything else we should sort of consider when thinking about the organic growth figure?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah well, first of all, there's no loss of CIGNA basis that we had, continues to be consistent with the levels that we had prior to renewing that contract and most of the underlying organic growth that we're seeing is as a result of Aetna contract.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Ralph, I don't know if you have seen it. But Footnote 4 on to the press release does way out on the significant drivers... in the revenue net line.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just to clarify I think there was notably an extended extension of the key managed care contract, was that the AmeriPath, UNH, is that what was refer to?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, is there any other update, sort of, contracting in the North East around GHI and HIP plans. There has been sort of buzz in the market about sort of that contract potentially coming up. Could you just give us the details on sort of the timing of that, if there has been any recent change et cetera?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Ralph. We don't specifically comment on contracts particularly when there was ongoing discussions. But what I can tell you is we are contracted provider to both those plans and we would expect to continue to be a contractor provider to both those plans.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, my last one just sort of thoughts and acquisitions. You guys have paid down decent amount of debt. I know you sort of said you're out of the acquisition market in terms of the large scale. There is some fairly sizable outreach slabs out there, I guess on the block. Can you maybe talk about your appetite for acquisitions at this point?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first, let me step back and put it into context of the capital structure. We manage the capital structures there. We've got the flexibility to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions and other growth opportunities. But, also, I want to make sure that we've got sufficient operating flexibility to address situations, which could impact our cash flow, like the NID settlement. But in each case, we are considering what will provide the greatest long-term shareholder value and to me that means having a prudent amount of leverage in operating within certain parameters. That translates into generally not allowing our debt-to- EBITDA much over 2.25 times for an extended period. We're currently outside those parameters. A special, if you think about $241 million reserve was setup for an Id as short-term debt. At this point, the majority of our excess cash flow this year is going to be use to pay down debt as we said we pay down a little over $500 million in the last 12 months. And that will be the focus this year, it doesn't mean that we won't do any acquisitions, but the principle focus of deploying cash flow deployment will be to repay debt this year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Apologies if you've already address this, but could you just talk a little bit to whether you can spike out any impact to volume from either the extra day in the quarter from leap year or that the flue season?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually, it's an interesting question. As we analyze the volume and number of business days, that we have this year in the first quarter, the number of business days is actually flat with what it was in the prior year despite the fact that we have the extra day of leap year. So there is really no impact to volume as result of that. With respect to the flue season, I'll tell you, we've had flue seasons that have been non-existent. We've had really difficult flue seasons. And historically, we have not seen any significant impact through our volume as result of the flue season. Part of that because there is not a specific test for the flue to the degree that it drives increases in physician office visits, you might see a little more testing. But generally there is nothing in the volumes that we can see this quarter associated with the flu season.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Great. And if I could ask a question on sort of a more historical basis. Have you tried looking back or how the volumes may relate to the economy in any way, if there is some historical perspective that there is a lagged relationship between slowdown and acceleration in economic growth, and maybe three to five years? Have you looked at that relative to your own business?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We have. And as I said earlier, if we're going to see any impacts of the economy in our physician business, it will show up in the volumes. But in the past when we've seen the impact of the economy show up, it really has not been significant in terms of volumes.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It was maybe 1% to 2% in the past. And as I said, we have not seen anything that we can discern in either our first quarter or the second half of last year that we can attribute to the economy.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And one more question, if I could. In California there apparently Blue Cross in that market has cut laboratory imbursement, again, apparently to 70% of Medicare. I am not sure who they are applying that to. Is that something that you are aware of? Is that having a positive or negative impact on you guys?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're obviously aware of that. And we have a contract with them in that marketplace, which guides what our reimbursement will be there.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Are you seeing more volume directed to you though as a result, I mean, if there are some independent stat.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There's nothing significant on that front.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open Sir.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. Bob, before I think you said in response to one of the questions about bad debt, there is a big opportunity there and it's a good chunk of the $500 million expected in cost savings. Have you quantified; I don't recall if you had said, but what portion of the $500 million is related to bad debt?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have not given specific guidance on the components, but what we have said is, when you look at the $500 million and you look at where most of our costs are, for the most part, the savings is proportionate to where the costs reside in our business. Obviously the biggest piece of it coming from the laboratory, where we've got much of our cost. And then you look at purchasing, you look at bad debt et cetera.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: And, I think Laure, you said the physician fee schedule, you are not expecting any change there, so continued fixed days in place. Is it material either way or could you quantify what the change would be if it didn't get fixed or if the fix wasn't continued?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Keep in mind obviously, the only think it would impact is anything that's of anatomic pathology testing for Medicare. So it's a modest but a large piece after the AmeriPath acquisition, but we've not specifically quantified it, and obviously everything is baked in here.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right, okay, but it's sort of modest, that's what you'd say?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Medicare in totality for us, for all pieces of business is 15%.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: And it's going to be a subset of that.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right. As you said, how big would that be then, versus the total 15?
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: The 15% would include anatomic pathology and clinical laboratory testing. So, in total, Medicare is 15% and of our total book of anatomic pathology is about 16% to 17% revenues.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then United, you sort of said I guess that you have been pretty steady there in the percent of business that you have retained. You have been saying for some time that you would expect that to go down, is that still the case and what is sort of your outlook there then for I guess this year, on United related business?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are not giving you specific guidance around that because that's not going to be valuable, I don't think to anybody. We have not seen a significant in the amount of business we've retained. Although, over time, we expect that some of that business will continue to shift away, because of United's efforts there. But that is all built into the guidance that we have provided to you for this year.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then my last one Bob, I just wanted to make sure I understood the one statement that you did make before. I guess base volume growth in the 1% to 2% range. I think when you were responding, maybe to Ricky's question, that I think it was something like most organic growth is the result of the Aetna contract? So how do you see industry growth versus your contract that you have added contributing to your base volume growth at this point?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as I said, most of the base volume growth is coming from the Aetna agreement and as we step back and we look at total industry growth, which I think is more to your question here. We still think that, over time, its going to be around 5% organic revenue growth. And again as I said earlier, it's not necessarily appropriate to focus on just volume of just or just revenue per acquisition in any one quarter.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Alright. Okay thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kemp Dolliver of Cowen. Your line is open.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen and Company: Hi. Thanks and good morning. Two question on AmeriPath. First, could you just talk about what actions you have completed so far as it relates to say, sales force training for cross selling and anything related? And then also just, if the retention of the pathologists is still at the level you had mentioned in the last call?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Kemp. First of all, I'm really very pleased with the progress we have made in aligning AmeriPath with Quest Diagnostics. We were concerned about pathology retention, I can tell you that we have retained all our pathologists and they are engaged in growing the combined organization. We have also renewed the contract with United that was a worry, whether United will renew the contract with AmeriPath or not, but that's behind us. We have no customer attrition to speak of, and we have completed the specialty integration. Now we are in the process of integrating the sales force to do the cross selling. So, we are moving with deliberate speed, as we told you that we slowed down the IT rollout. Hello?
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen and Company: Sorry, continue.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. All in all, actually we have made good progress and we are moving in deliberate speed and AmeriPath is on track.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen and Company: Great. Thank you.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from Robert Willoughby of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Hi, Bob. I guess you didn't want to comment on the components of the $500 million in cost savings that you've indicated, but can you help us prioritize or at least kind of rank where the savings from switching suppliers from Cardinal to Thermo is on that list?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You know what, that's one of many, many things that we are doing on the procurement side. And again, I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on any one contract, whether it's a customer contract or a supplier contract.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: And to get an allocation of what kind of buckets the cost are in, actually in the most recent Investor Presentation, its on the website there is pie-chart, what's the cost on a ratio basis between the major buckets been… Basically work within the lab, purchasing, billing in the other areas. So there is a pie-chart that supports the 500 on a ratio basis.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Great. And just depreciation and amortization a bit light relative to where our expectation was, is this the new run-rate or do you anticipate any incremental charges with the new systems this year?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well. Again that's not necessarily component of our P&L that we would give guidance on, but I would not expect it to be dramatically different than you're seeing the first quarter.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is open.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Hi. Good morning. I just had a follow-up question on AmeriPath. Could you provide an update on your efforts to drive cost and revenue synergies out of the acquisition? And also, I think last quarter you had indicated that operating margins would be over up year-over-year, are you still seeing those same trends in AmeriPath?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well. With respect to the cost in revenue synergies, most of the cost synergies were coming from the integration of specialty laboratories. And as Surya mentioned earlier, that integration is essentially complete at this point, And we feel good about that. And here the revenue synergies are really going to come as we sell the AmeriPath value proposition into the primary care physicians' offices and sort of comes to… That we are making good progress around getting a line to run that.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay. And then in terms of the operating margins, are you still seeing that same trends in terms of year-over-year increases?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In terms of operating margin, as we realize the synergies there, as we start to ratchet down near bad debt. We would expect that the operating margin for the AmeriPath business will continue to improve over the course of the year, not dramatically different in first quarter than it was, as we exited last year.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: I got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Bonello of Wachovia Securities. Your line is open.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. So, first of all back on the cost savings, you mentioned where you ended '07, and you mentioned where you expect to end '08, I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of the sequential increase in cost savings achieved in Q1 relative to Q4 of last year. And then just as we look forward, some sense of the timing, in other words, just trying to figure out how much of these cost savings are back-end loaded in 2008, or is it a pretty steady progression throughout the year?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Bill, again I'm trying to stay away from giving quarterly guidance here, as much as you would love me to do that. But as we exit this year, we expect to have about half of the remainder in the books at that point in a run rate basis. And obviously, for us to get there, we can't have it all coming in the fourth quarter, so you should expect that there is some ramping up throughout the year, but yeah, we're making good progress in each of the quarters this year in order to get to that number.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Did you made some progress in Q1 relative to Q4?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, the cost saving is real, it's happening.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then, I guess, the next question would be and just as we think about the startup cost, and I know you've addressed this before, but I just want to make sure we have it correct the $0.20 of startup costs, can you give us some sense, quantification of what portion of that recurs in '09, and what's essentially non-recurring?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, here is the way I think about it. First, there were two big buckets, right? One is the startup cost associated with India, which we estimate to be around $0.07 or so. And let's follow through on that one first. India, we expect it going to be in a startup mode for this year and next. And we expect to have some ongoing startup losses next year as well. We're targeting for India to be breakeven by the time we get into 2010. So, yeah, there is going to be some recurring costs there next year. With respect to the systems deployment, the development and the deployment, much of that, if not all of that development cost will be incurred in behind this year, and the other piece which is really the deployment cost is starting to occur this year. There will be some next year because that's a key element to our standardization and enabling us to realize the $500 million in savings, but next year's amount associated with systems will be far less than this year. And what that's going to be, it's a little premature to tell you. I think all of that's going to be a function of the progress that we make this year.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. That is helpful, though. And then, just as we think, as you look at what your initiatives are to drive that $500 million, are there any additional sort of non-recurring costs that might not be occurring now that you already expect to come online in '09 or 2010?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The only non-recurring cost that we are not incurring now could potentially be associated with workforce reductions. But frankly, we're managing most of that through voluntary turnover. And yeah, that's the way we've managed the vast majority of it to date and the way we will manage it as we go forward.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then, just the last question. Just trying to sort of bridge the quarterly results to the guidance, I mean if you do $0.72 in the quarter to get to the low end of the guidance then you'll have to do $0.76 per quarter for the next three quarters plus you're going to have an incremental $0.02 to $0.03 of startup cost in each of those quarter. So, you need sort of extra $0.06, $0.07 of improvement. I mean is most of that coming from increased cost saving over the future quarters or what else drive such significantly higher EPS in the future quarters than in Q1?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, certainly, a big element of it is to ramp-up and the costs save. But also, keep in mind, we're expecting that our growth is going to continue to accelerate.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. So, if you do even relative to Q1, you expect your tax cost saving, you would still expect some incremental ramp?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. That's very helpful.
Laure Park - Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations: Okay.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andreas Dirnagl. Your line is open. I am showing from JPMorgan.
Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan: Yeah. Hi, guys. Since still… Bill for my big question. I will just ask my last one, which is more of a thorough one, Bob, sort of when you are commenting, I think it was on Matt's question about doing the analysis as to whether the economy has any impact and/or has had any impact in the past. Clearly, you talked about the downside in those two portions of the business. Have you also done an analysis as to whether sort of, you guys are also part of what we see, particularly in hospitals where you have an acceleration of some elective procedures? Does that result in higher volumes in pre-recessionary environment? I mean, in other words, is some of this volume because of that and at danger of slowing down?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That would be a very, very difficult question to answer. I don't believe so, but I don't know that we have anything that we can look at, which would help us attempt to even quantify that.
Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan: Like in the past, you haven't seen any sort of significant spikes in volume prior to an economic downturn?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, we have not.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Most of our business, Andreas, comes from physician offices and I think Diagnostics is still a healthcare service, so think if there is some changes it will be very slow. But as Bob said that, we are prepared to manage our costs if there is going to be any softness.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And keep in mind to, if this is actually happening with elective procedures, which are taking place in hospitals and elsewhere. Those are bigger ticket items. We're talking much smaller dollar amounts here. So, I'm not necessarily sure that people would think about either delaying or accelerating this as a result of their thoughts around the economy.
Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Thanks, good morning. I appreciate the earlier comments on the Blue Cross Blue Shield contract of California. Just wanted to follow-up there, are we seeing any other activity in the balance of the WellPoint, Blue Cross Blue Shield? And I guess follow-on, have you seen any changes in any of those contracts over the balance of the year? Thank you.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have nothing to report on any of the other WellPoint contracts and we're not anticipating any significant changes, any of them over the course of the remainder of the year.
Operator: And our last question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of UBS. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Yeah. Just one follow-up question. As far as AmeriPath, not sure if you quantified or not, but, what was the EPS impact in the quarter?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In the quarter, it was still slightly dilutive, not significantly different than we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. But as the year progresses, we expect to see improvement there.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: So you expect it to breakeven by one in the year?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have not given specific guidance on that and frankly we're starting to integrate that business now and it becomes very difficult to segregate that out as you proceed on that line.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay, thank you.

Laure Park - Investor Relations: Thank you and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date that they are made and which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different.

A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A downloadable spreadsheet with our results and supplemental revenue analysis is also available on the website. Now, here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Laure. During the quarter, we established strong growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow. Consolidated revenues grew to $1.8 billion. Operating margin grew to 17.6%, the third consecutive quarter of strong improvement. And cash flow was strong $355 million for the quarter. We entered 2007 with uncertainty regarding industrial pricing and access to health fund contracts. Over the past 12 months, we have taken many decisive actions to reduce that uncertainty and drive strong performance improvements. But these short-term issues did not paralyze us from executing our long-term growth strategy. As a result, we are a stronger company now, than compared to 12 months ago. During the year, we renewed or expanded relationships with most of the major health plans. We drove productivity improvements, while improving service and embarked on an initiative to reduce our cost structure by an additional $500 million. We continued to build our liver patient testing business by acquiring HemoCue a leader in that industry. We continue to lead with innovations both in medicine and information technology. We established a presence in the growing Indian market and with the acquisition of AmeriPath. We became the world leader in cancer diagnostics. Our longer-term goals are to grow revenue profitably above the industry growth rate, to expand operating income to 20% of revenues and to derive 10% of consolidated revenues from international business within five years. Later, I will elaborate on this growth plans, but first Bob will review our performance and guidance.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Surya. As you heard from Surya and as you've seen in our results, we've continued to make excellent progress in improving earnings over the course of the year. Despite the loss of the contract with our largest private payer intensified pricing pressure and an increased competitive environment in the quarter we managed to improve our revenues and profits over the prior year. This progress stands from the decisive actions we took in the first quarter, and the hard work throughout the year to reestablish revenue growth, streamline our operations, and enhance our service offerings. The actions we have taken and the plans we have in place, we are solidly positioned for sustaining revenue and earnings growth. In addition, we have continued our discussions with the government in an effort to reach the settlement regarding its investigation of NID, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary closed in 2006. As result of further discussions, we have increased the reserve we established in the third quarter by $190 million, $241 million, and recorded the charge as part of discontinuing the operations. While this a substantial increase to reserve, we believe that we are closer to either settling this matter or determining that an acceptable settlement cannot be reached. Even that we are in going discussions, what we can say is limited and is contained in footnote six of the earnings release. Obviously, we want to put this matter behind us quickly. However, it remains unclear as to how long it may take to bring into closure. We are committed to do what we believe is right for our company and shareholders. If we are unable to reach an acceptable settlement, we are fully prepared to litigate this matter. Now, let's turn to fourth quarter performance from continuing operations. In order assist in making comparisons, as I go through results, I'll highlight the impact of AmeriPath and a number of key metrics. In addition to highlight our progress, I'll point down improvements in certain metrics over the last several quarters. Revenues were $1.8 billion, 14.3% above the prior year with AmeriPath contributing about 13% growth. Revenues for our clinical testing business, which account for over 19% of our total revenues, were 13.1% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing 14%. Volume was about 1.5% below the prior year and about 6% below without the AmeriPath acquisition. This reflects continued improvement from the third quarter. Revenue per acquisition increased 13.7% with 8.3% of the increase due to AmeriPath. The balance of the increase in revenue per acquisition continues to be primarily driven by a positive mix. We estimate that consolidated revenues were reduced by a little over 5% due to our change in status with United, with clinical testing volume reduced by about 8%, partially offset by a positive impact of revenue per acquisition of 2%. Positive impact to revenue per acquisition is associated with higher reimbursement on the retained United work. Throughout the fourth quarter, we saw a little change in our United volume and continued to maintain over 20% of the previously contracted level. We expect that some additional United volume will move overtime. However, we continue to be encouraged by physician's decisions to select Quest Diagnostic when given a choice and have seen no further loss of discretionary work during the quarter. Adjusted for the change associated with United, we saw a further improvement in our base volume growth of about 2% compared to that of the third quarter. Improvement principally related to our new Aetna agreement and improved productivity of our sales force. Organic revenue growth in our non-clinical testing businesses as a group, which includes our clinical trial testing business and the risk assessment business, was 10% for the fourth quarter. The acquisition of HemoCue contributed about 1.5% to consolidated revenue growth. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 17.6% for the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year. Our base business for the result of AmeriPath is now achieving margins above the prior year level. Fourth quarter margins reflect further improvement of about 1 percentage point from the year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, which itself reflected significant improvement from the first two quarter comparisons. As I mentioned earlier, these improvements are due to actions taken to reduce our cost structure, higher revenue per acquisition and improved volume. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4% and 3.6% before the inclusion of AmeriPath. This is an improvement of almost of 0.5% compared to the third quarter, and it comes from our base business. AmeriPath, which carries a higher bad debt rate than the rest of our business much of it due to inpatient work done for hospitals and billing systems conversions, will increase our bad debt expense by about 1% for the time being. As I mentioned in the last quarter, while it has taken us longer than we expected to reduce AmeriPath's bad debt, eventual synergy opportunity related to bad debt remains unchanged. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.79 compared to $0.77 in the prior year. The impact of the change in contract status with United has now been fully offset and we are back on path on the path of sustained revenue and earnings growth. Included in footnote five to the earnings release, is a table, which summarizes the impact of various revenue measures for a number of the items discussed. Cash from operations for the quarter was very strong at $355 million and above of the prior year for the second consecutive quarter. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $225 million bringing the total debt reductions since the AmeriPath acquisition to over $400 million. Cash at quarter end was $168 million similar to the Q3 level; after all expenditures were $76 million in the quarter. Days sales improved to 48 days, two days better than Q3 and back to the prior year level despite AmeriPath adding two days to our total. Looking back on 2007, the fourth quarter cap off a year of tremendous progress despite some significant challenges. Our program to reduce costs by 500 million is in full swing. We had over 100 million of this benefit in our run rate as we exited 2007 and are on track to achieve the full amount as we edge to 2009. Much of the benefit will be in our laboratories, where we are deploying lean, Six Sigma and plan to realize substantial productivity gains. Additionally, we are driving efficiencies in the other areas by better aligning our service capacity with patient and sample promos. We are driving more of our purchasing to master contracts to take better advantage of our scale. We are rapidly deploying customer return activity, which reduces cost and a specimen data entry and billing and helps in lower our bad debt. We are improving the efficiency of our logistics routes using advanced route optimization tools. We are transitioning to lower cost and more fuel efficient logistics vehicles. We have streamlined our management structure, established clear targets and have deployed the mechanisms to monitor and drive execution. And we exited the year with annualized revenues of $7 billion, improved profitability from the year before and growing momentum as we enter 2008. Now, let's turn to your outlook for 2008. Our current guidance for results from continuing operations is as follows. We expect revenue growth to approximate 9%. We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to approach 17%. We expect cash from operations to approximate $900 million and we expect capital expenditures of between $280 and $300 million. And lastly, we expect diluted earnings per share to between $3 and $3.20, excluding any potential special charges. Earnings per share are after about $0.20 of investments we are making in 2008 to accelerate long-term revenue and earnings growth. Approximately $0.13 is associated with development and deployment of standard systems across both the AmeriPath practices and our clinical labs, which will enable a significant productivity gains and improved customer service. And approximately $0.07 is attributable to startup costs of our India operations, which we expect to be a major contributor to our future growth. Now, I will turn it back to Surya.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Bob. 2007 was an important year in which we drove performance improvements and continued to build the foundation for sustained growth. We grow our business by focusing on sales, service and science. Our sales force is energized and driving results. During the fourth quarter, we accelerated underlying revenue growth by almost 3%, compared to that of the third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions in United, fourth quarter revenues grew about 5%. Patients, doctors and heath plans appreciate our quality, access and convenience. We continue to expand the use of our unique appointment scheduling system for our patient service centers. One clear sign that patients and physicians care about the superior service we provide is our ability to retain the majority of the discretionary business, despite the united contract change. We see the opportunity to accelerate growth by working with payers and employers to shift more of their testing to us, which is currently going out of network or to higher price providers. We continue to lead the industry with the important new tests and the most complete testing menu for physicians. With AmeriPath, we are the clear leader in clinical pathology, anatomy pathology, as well as gene-based and esoteric testing. And our technology enables testing to move closer to the patient; we are prepared with a growing platform in near patient or point of care testing. We continue to diversify our revenue base of our $7 billion in revenues about 35% now comes from anatomy pathology and gene-based and esoteric testing, versus 26% of $4 billion revenue in 2002. Our acquisition of AmeriPath made us a clear leader in cancer diagnostics. We have strengthened our integrated offering of clinical, AP, and esoteric testing for hospitals, specialists and primary care physicians. We are excited about the opportunity to accelerate our growth in anatomic pathology. A lot of tissue specimens come from primary care physicians. This is significant growth opportunity and one that AmeriPath previously had no way of realizing due to its limited infrastructure to reach these doctors. Our AmeriPath pathologists, who are critical assets, are very supportive and eager to realize these benefits. And they recently signed a new multi-year contract with UnitedHealthcare. We are entering the decade of diagnostics. The healthcare wall is moving from a focus and curative care to a reliance on early detection, prevention, and expanded use of personalized and targeted medicine. Molecular tests are now used for more than diagnostics to predict present outcomes, determine genetic predispositions and monitor response to drug therapy. For example, our comparative genomic hybridization microarray was initially validated to identify mental retardation in newborns. Now we are applying it to other testing areas such leukemia. We have introduced several block tests to reduce patient pain and provide early detection. For example, our HepaScore Liver Fibrosis Panel uses a noninvasive approach to predict significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with Hepatitis C without requiring a liver biopsy. Also, our expanding Leumeta family of cancer diagnostics enables physicians to monitor leukemia and lymphoma using blood specimens without painful bone marrow biopsies. We continue to invest in our information technology, which is an important differentiator and a key enabler of almost everything we do. We are investing to upgrade and standardize systems across our company including connecting AmeriPath systems to our Care360 portal. We now have 125,000 physician users of our Care360 products. We see tremendous opportunities to use healthcare ID to make our diagnostic insights more easily available to doctors, hospitals and eventually to patients. We improved medical safety and help drive better healthcare decision. Point-of-care-testing will help us to diversify further and also drive growth in the physician business by offering doctors choice and convenience. They can select additional laboratory testing or in-office testing depending on the needs of each patient. The $6 billion market for point-of-care-test is growing at a rate of 8% to 10 % a year and we are well positioned to benefit from the shift to our point of adjusting. During the quarter, we received FDA clearance for two new tests, the HerpeSelect Express HSV-2 test and a white blood cell test on our HemoCue platform. This test designed to be simple enough for use in clinics and other point-of-care settings and can produce results within minutes. The ability of physicians to provide council and treatment options and lifestyle changes during a single office visit will benefit patients, who are anxious about their results or maybe unwilling or unable to return for a second visit. Now, coming to international; India is an enormous growth opportunity and one in which we will be investing over the next several years. Our offerings in India will include advance esoteric testing for hospitals, physicians, and patients, clinical trial testing for global pharmaceutical companies, and clinical testing for life insurance companies. We also see opportunities overtime to reduce our cost to perform clinical trial testing using our Indian facilities. In summary, 2007 was a year of significant achievements. We took bold and decisive actions to deal with short-term businesses and strengthen the foundation of our company for long-term sustainable growth. We reestablished growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flow; we exited the year a much stronger company. The opportunities before us are better than ever before, and we are excited about our future and committed to superior long-term shareholder returns. We will now take your questions. Operator? Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Bill Bonello with Wachovia.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. I have a couple of follow-up questions predominantly related to your guidance for next year. First of all, just on the revenue growth, can you give us a sense of how much AmeriPath is expected to contribute to revenue growth in 09?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bill, this is Bob. It's about 4% or so, organic revenue growth is about 5%; that's embedded in the guidance.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And the real step-up in the organic revenue growth will just be that you have annualized the negative impact from United?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly that's part of it, but again as we told you, the underlying revenue growth when you strip out the impact of United has accelerated over the course of the year.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay perfect. And then you mention that the AmeriPath reaching a contract with UNH. Can you just tell us... I mean do you think that gives you any kind of an opportunity to recapture any of the business that you have lost?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Bill, this is Surya. AmeriPath renewed their contract at United and what it does tell us that anatomic pathology is very different from clinical pathology. And we have the premium pathologist and it is the reason why we acquired AmeriPath, but it is a specific contract for AmeriPath. And it will be kept separately.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. But you can't... so you don't have the ability to say on something like path that I guess you could consider AP, you don't have the ability to sort of shift business towards AmeriPath?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, that's not the intent of this contract, and the other thing is that we still have 20% of the United customers still with us, and you they really appreciate the service we provide.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But with that said, that doesn't mean that we aren't going to try and regains some of the United business has been lost.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Based on our account.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Based upon continuing to provide what we believe is a superior service to physician and patients.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And I will ask one last question if I can, and get back in the queue, but the investment income that you are spending next year, thank you giving breakout there. Can you give us some sense of what we should be thinking about in terms of an expected return on investment from India? I mean what should we be looking for India to contribute earnings or cash flow and sort of over what period?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bill, it's Bob again. What I would say with respect to India is you should assume that for the next several years, it's going to be a net investment, anytime you enter a new market, you'd expect to make an investment upfront in order to have significant gains in the future. This year, our lab is going to be coming online actually this quarter, and we are going to incur a significant amount start of startup costs. But there is... as Surya said, there is tremendous opportunity there. Today it's a growing market as underserved. The middle class in India is large as the entire U.S. population. And India is going to be an important element of our growth strategy internationally. As you heard us say before, we expect international revenues to account for about 10% of our total revenues within about five years or so.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, but in terms of it being a positive contribution, I mean we were really should think of that as that's really building for the future, I mean maybe three to five years out or something?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Correct, that's true. And I think it's going to take three to five years, but as we said that we are expecting $1 billion from international in five years. So India is going to be our largest investment outside the United States.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, great. Thank you, I will get back in the queue.
Operator: Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Good morning, thank you. First just following up on that last question there, in terms of the organic growth expectations, can you give us any color on sort of volume versus price and within price, I think you said in the quarter, mostly driven by mix, we're expecting in terms of absolute pricing in 08?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Tom, as you know we tend not to provide the components of the revenue growth, what I can tell you though is we expect full price net revenue per acquisition and volume growth to be positive in 08, and that the revenue per acquisition increases will again continue to be principally driven by test mix and in the number of test order per acquisition.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But remember, some of the pricing concessions that we had to make in 07 really go into effect in 08.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right. On the volume side, although you won't give a specific number, maybe anecdotally can you tell us how you handled certain things like any assumptions for further deterioration of your United business or I think the LabOne contract with United is up, and I know that LabCorp is excited about an opportunity to market to CIGNA, are you seeing any changes within that customer base either at this point?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, a couple of things. With respect to LabOne and that contract coming up in May, that's really at the minimus amount of revenues for us. It's only several million dollars of revenues that we generate from that. And we have actually over the course of the last year seen what we think is going to be most of an attrition on that contract. With respect to CIGNA, listen the LabCorp was on that contract previously, as well as were we, and we have not seen any significant change there in the volume associated with the CIGNA members. And as I said earlier, given that we have seen an uptick in our underlying volume over the course of this year, we expect to see some continued growth in that as we go through 2008.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And my last question would just be the cost of goods sold sequentially that's seemed deteriorate a bit, although the revenue base was sort of stable sequentially. Can you give us some further color on that line of item? Thanks.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Tom. Cost of goods sold again, I would encourage you not to look at it so much on a quarter-to-quarter basis or even SG&A on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We really manage at the operating margin line. And as I mentioned, we continue to see successive improvements about a point each quarter in 2007 in our operating margin comparisons versus the prior year. And when you strip AmeriPath now, we've actually achieved operating margins, which are in excess of the prior year. So, we feel good about the work that we've done to pull costs out. In some cases, whether it be in cost of sales or SG&A, some of actions we've taken to reduce the size of the workforce, those costs show up in there. And again that's why I encourage you not to look at on any single quarter.
Operator: Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking our question. This is Shelly in for Matt Borsch this morning. The first question is, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail behind the 2008 guidance, relative to SG&A. I am wondering not to focus too much on the improvement we saw in the quarter, but I am wondering how much further improvement there is in SG&A in 2008. And may be how is that offset by the developments in India?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Shelly, we don't give guidance for SG&A or cost of sales percentages, that's why we gave it to you operating income as a percentage of revenues. Again that's how we manage the business. And we expect that there is going to continuing improvement there. But certainly some of these investments that we are talking about will offset that. A lot the India investment will probably show up in cost of sales, but we will also see some of it in SG&A.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then I guess relative to the 17% operating margin, then I guess that what we should be talking about. Is that lower than your expectations a quarter or two ago?
Laure Park - Investor Relations: The 08 really reflects continued improvement offset by these investments, which are really being put out for future growth. So, I don't think there is really any change from what we are thinking.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Yes, thanks. Good morning. First question, thanks for the breakdown on the payer side; I was hoping to maybe flush out Medicare versus Medicaid little further obviously collective with your 17% revenue, but can you breakdown those two a little bit more please?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, Medicare is about 15% with Medicaid about 2% to 3%, and that's pretty consistent with what it's historically been. And when you look at the Medicare, Medicaid reimbursement on average, it's about equal to our average reimbursement for the company.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Understood. Thanks, Bob, I appreciate the color there. Separately, if my math is right, did AmeriPath slowdown little bit on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter? I guess first is assumption correct and secondly can you just add a little color there?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Bill, with respect to AmeriPath, we are not breaking out specifically AmeriPath revenues or contributions. As you start to bring businesses together and you are operating as one business, it becomes a lot more difficult to do that. What I would say though is as we look at the AmeriPath opportunity and again trying to look at anything on a quarter-to-quarter basis, because you can get misleading statistics. But nothing has changed regarding our excitement about the opportunity to accelerate growth there for both AmeriPath and Quest Diagnostics. On a full year basis for AmeriPath, their organic revenue grew around... between 7% and 8%.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And then, so safe to assume then that we've got fairly stable trends within the employment of that group?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, with respect to the pathologist, I think we've had very stable pathology engagement. And in fact the pathologists are... I think as excited as we are about the opportunity to leverage the infrastructure that Quest brings to grow the AP business.
William Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. Thanks very much guys,
Operator: Robert Willoughby with Banc of America.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Can you speak to the ongoing relationship on the clinical trials business, testing business with Quest, so we have heard some... share had moved away. Is there any formal contract in place? And can you give any details on that?
Laure Park - Investor Relations: Robert, this is Laure. We have a formal contract in place and actually we've singed on a letter of agreement that extent that contract beyond the expiration by an additional five years. We are excited about our relationship with Glaxo and it continues strong.
Robert M. Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: That's it. Thank you
Operator: Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning. Can you maybe talk about that $0.20 investment in the context of your 20% operating margin goal?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. The first thing I would tell you is, think about it as an investment, not necessarily ongoing cost. About 13% or so is associated with upgrading systems and that's going to be an important enabler for us to realize the $500 million of savings. Yeah, these are for the most part, development and implementation cost, they are not recurring costs, whereas the $500 million will be an ongoing and is net of any ongoing cost that we are going to incur.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: So 20%... is 20% excluding sort of the investment or are you saying that 20% is what you are still looking to achieve by... was it 2009?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We didn't put a specific date out there for when we expect to achieve the 20% operating income. But it's certainly our goal and these are investments that we are making today to position us to get to that 20%.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just on the AmeriPath and the investment in the systems. I mean is this... it sounds like there is something incremental and not incorporated in when you sort of gave the guidance initially on AmeriPath and what you thought the EBITDA contribution will be in 2008?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: This is incremental to what we initially anticipated, the new systems both the lab and the billing system, which AmeriPath were deploying or now being enhanced and they are going to be connected to our Care360 system, so that physicians will have a complete electronic record of both their anatomic pathology results and their clinical pathology results. And as we look at these systems, they are also going to improve, we believe the productivity of the pathologist and the efficiency of the AmeriPath billing operations, and help us get that bad debt issue that they have got there.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just looking at organic growth, if I look at 4Q, strip out UNH, AmeriPath and other acquisitions; it looks like the organic growth is about 5%.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's about right.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Is there anything else in that number I should be looking at like an Aetna impact. Was that meaningful at all?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly Aetna was one of the things that helped us to accelerate the volume growth and that was a contributor to it.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. So, but... I mean looking at it 5% versus your guidance for next year of 4%, maybe some of that discrepancy is sort of incremental Aetna?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, the 4% that I mentioned was the impact with the contribution associated with AmeriPath; therefore 5% is the organic number.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. All right, I see and then just my last question here. The 9% top-line assumption, just want to make sure, if there is anything else I need to be aware of in terms of... it sounds like LabOne isn't -- you don't expect that much more loss. Don't expect a whole lot from CIGNA. Is there any expectation of sort of more pull through from Aetna or anything on the acquisition side that's embedded in that number, any color there would be helpful.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I wouldn't say that there is any one specific item that's driving that number. Again, over the course of the year, we had our sales force focused on a whole bunch of things, other than just selling. There were a lot of contract changes that they need to deal with. Those are essentially set at this point and the sales force is very focused on selling at this point. And we really have no further acquisitions built into that number. That's really organic; we have 5% through organic growth.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great thanks.
Operator: Art Henderson with Jefferies & Company.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Bob, when do the UnitedHealthcare LabOne revenues start to roll off? Is that mid year?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, the contract is up in May of 08.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Okay.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But again I mentioned, it's relatively the deminimus, the amount of revenues that we are generated from that contract today.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Is there... can you put a number around that or are you not comfortable doing that?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Several millions dollars.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Several millions, okay.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Triple digits.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, thanks. And also in looking at the timing of the expenses that you've have talked about with relation to the IT investment in India, should we be thinking about that in anyway on a quarterly basis, will it be earlier in the year, later in the year, how should we think about that?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would tell you that they are going to be incurred throughout the year. I, at this point, don't want to try and get too specific quarter-by-quarter. Obviously, we don't give quarterly guidance, but it's really going to be a function of the readiness in our plans and for executing and will make sure that everything is lined up before we go forward and that will drive the timing of some of those things.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: And I know you mentioned to Ralph just a second ago about these being incremental. Is there anything that you have seen, as you have gotten moving ahead with the integration of AmeriPath that's been disappointing or surprising to you in some way? I mean can you characterize how you feel... I mean I know overall you feel good about it, but what has sort of struck you is being surprising to the downside.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This is Surya. Let me tell you a little bit. First of all, there was nothing surprising. We acquired AmeriPath as a game changer into the industry just like when you acquired SBCL and we remain really excited about how we can bring these two companies together. Now there are number of elements of integration around track. For example, specialty is now integrated with our hospital business. The most important thing for us to have a cultural integration and I am very happy to tell you that both companies are culturally integrated. So nobody is leaving, the pathologists are pretty excited and engaged. And they are influencing some of our strategic discussion going on about cancer diagnostics. I was worried about United contract. And we have not lost any significant customers. So, all those things are really going in the right direction. Obviously, we are a conservative management and we have lot of experience in integration. So we intentionally delayed two or three elements, and that's a deliberate delay to make sure that we build this business for long-term rather than short-term. And they are like going down the IT conversion they were on path. Because we wanted to really make sure that they have all the features and benefits, which will have both companies. Looking at the bad debt, bad debt is just only a systems issue result, a culture issue. So those are the two things that is going to take a little longer, but I am really very proud of the number of pathologists we have, and what they can do with the company and this was, when you look back, would have been... will be the game changer in this industry, so I am pretty excited about it.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, that's very helpful. One last question for you, Surya, and I will jump back in the queue. How big is the Indian market right now and what is it growing at?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, how big is the Indian market? Indian market in diagnostics is probably like 20 or 25 years ago in the United States. It's very a fragmented market. It's a nascent market. It's only $1 billion dollar, but because you really have this 300 million middle class, there is a lot of discretionary income. They are now moving from consumer electronics to healthcare. So if we just take 300 million middle class, it's same as the population here. So I believe that that market is going to grow at least 15% to 20% as we go forward. And we are starting from scratch and building the value proposition and we believe that this is going to be the largest return for us and that's the reason why we announced this time that in the long-term, in five years we will have 10% of our consolidated revenue from international. But we have also... as you see, we just announced our first contract yesterday from Birla Sun Life. And like any other things, it's going to take some time, but again India represents the biggest opportunity for us outside the United States.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And I think down the road, India is going to present acquisition opportunities as well. It's a very fragmented market today. And as to we have our operations up and running for a while and we start growing organically there, down the road we will look at potential acquisition opportunities.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So, get ready to visit India in coming years.
Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Co.: Great. Look forward to. Thank you.
Operator: Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Hi, good morning. In addition to the international expansion, do you see an opportunity as to...
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Amanda, we can't hear you. Can you speak up please?
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: I'm sorry. Is that better?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's better.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay, sorry. In addition to the international expansion, do you see an opportunity to gain market share in the U.S. so and if so what strategies do you have in place to do so?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. As you remember we are the leader, but we only have 15% of the market share, there is lot of growth opportunities. As we mentioned that we are in medical service business, and the most important thing for our customer is quality and reputation. And because of our superior service, we still have 20% of United, and we are reorganizing our sales organization, they are focused, and our goal is to really grow and gain our market share in the U.S., and 15% is not where we are going to stop.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay. And then in terms of working with health plans to control leakage, are you seeing anything new or any new willingness out of health plans to implement to all to help control that metrics?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We look at collaboration and both health plans and also we are collaborating on how we really persuade the doctors to send the sample to us. And it's an active engagement between often health plans and it's something, which you have to constantly work on.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And it's not only the health plans that we are looking to do that and employers as well are looking to drive more of the work in network, so that they can realize the savings associated with that as well, and there is opportunities for us to work with payers and the employers jointly in that effort.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: The things like co-pays and things like that the employers are looking at?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly design is part of it, but just education yes, can drive a lot of it as well.
Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Kemp Dolliver with Cowen & Company.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Hi, thanks. First question relates to AmeriPath; and at the time of the acquisition, you had set out a goal for this year that the implied multiple would have... or the effective multiple would be ten times EBITDA. And given IT spending and the like, I am... you are still trying to reconcile whether that's still... you are going to achieve that this year and if not how much of a variance we are likely to see?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Kemp, as I mentioned the IT spend is incremental to what we initially anticipated and while this year AmeriPath was somewhat dilutive or maybe a little more dilutive than we had anticipated and lot of it being associated with bad debt. We are expecting significant improvements in 2008, but we are not providing a specific 2008 impact as I said earlier, when you start to bring two companies together and you operate it as one business. It becomes really difficult to break it out. And frankly we've never done that for an acquisition in the past and AmeriPath is really not going to be any different.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay. And Bob, I think you did give this earlier, but I wasn't sure I understood the numbers. How much of the incremental IT spending does... would relate directly to the things you want to do at AmeriPath?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The $0.20, about $0.13 is system's development and deployment, what I would characterize as the majority of that being AmeriPath.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: That's great, thanks. The second question relates to India; looking past this year, when you talk about the three to five year impact overtime, does that contemplate opening additional labs or are we in a situation where this year you've got the cost of entering the county, the cost of starting up one lab and that over the next few years, it's going to be a matter mainly of how well this lab does?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, Kemp, India is a very large country and some cities have five to ten million people, more than Sweden and Finland. So, we have to have other laboratories. We are cautious as far as our expansion, but our goal, as we said that for the next several years, we will invest in India and make sure that we establish ourselves in the major metropolitan area and provide esoteric testing for hospitals and specialists and do clinical trials. So, you will see we will build other laboratories, and also we will acquire companies there.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Is the profitability there likely to be comparable to U.S.?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, again we are just starting and the model is very different, because obviously there is no managed care organization there or private payers, but it's too early to say exactly whether it will have the same profit over there as the U.S.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay. Thanks.
Operator:
Dave Brampton with Trove Partners. [ph]:
Unidentified Analyst: Just a follow-up on... exactly who are the payers? Is there any government healthcare?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, there are some government payers like the dormant, depends railways, there are some companies and hospitals, they the insurers, but mainly it's like Brazil. It's mainly paid by the private payers... sorry, private patients and some employers.
Unidentified Analyst: And what is the approximate revenue per accession now?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's too... we are just opening the lab right now.
Unidentified Analyst: But there are people in business, I assume you have done some kind of work.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, lab is not yet operational.
Unidentified Analyst: Your lab, but there must be other people in the business.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I am, but you cannot really take their numbers to do certain things, we obviously have a different model, and we want to provide esoteric testing, and some of the labs they don't provide those tests.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right, I mean that's the important point. We are coming in with gene-based and esoteric testing and the high-end testing, this isn't going to be just a routine laboratory there, and obviously the revenue per rep will be very different.
Unidentified Analyst: Is your lab open? I am sorry, I didn't quite get it?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's going to open, go on line this quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: And do have the price list on routine testing available?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You are asking me the question, of course they are available, but obviously it's a local price list with a local market and...
Unidentified Analyst: How does it compare to U.S. prices?
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Of course, it's lower than U.S. prices. You are paying in dollars, and rupees will be very different.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The costs will also be lower there as well.
Unidentified Analyst: And is there any currency hedging you contemplate?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right now there is no business there, there is no hedging related to it, but certainly it's a vehicle that we consider for any foreign exchange risk that we got.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator:
Levon Von Reden with Hockey Capital. [ph]:
Unidentified Analyst: Just a couple of house keeping questions. Could you talk a little bit about your D&A and tax rate expectations for 08?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What was the question?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, could you talk about your depreciation and amortization and your tax rate for 08?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The tax rate for 08, the tax rate for 08 will be significantly different than it is for this year, which is just over 39% for the most part of our operations, the vast majority today are still domestic and you got 35% federal rate and then you have a state rates net of the federal benefits, which puts you in the 39% to 40% range or so.
Unidentified Analyst: And your depreciation and amortization?
Laure Park - Investor Relations: Amortization runs about $9 million a quarter, and then obviously depreciation...
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We don't give specific guidance on depreciation when you can take a look at what it ran in the fourth quarter and run your own models.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And since I got you on the line, for the free cash flow that you are expecting in a 08, uses of that maybe give some top-line expectation as well.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, as you know, we are going to be deploying some of the cash to deliver, that's one of the commitments we made to our lenders when we levered up to complete the AmeriPath transaction. But certainly, as we get back in line with the credit statistics that we target, then our excess cash flow generally, our first choice would be to have a go towards growth. And when those growth opportunities aren't available, then to share repurchases. And that's essentially the way historically operated the business, but again in 08, you will see us with the focus on repaying some of the debt, and getting the credit stats down and to more manageable levels.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Bill Bonello with Wachovia.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Well, great, thanks. Just a couple of follow-up questions; just on some of the other investments that you have done, can you give us any sense? And I know you said you don't break out specific initiatives, but just wondering if you can give us any sense of the current contribution from the three big acquisitions that were completed over the last couple of years, so AmeriPath, Focus, HemoCue. I mean are they still net-net a drag on earnings, are they contributing to earnings? How do we think about sort of return on invested capital for that? I guess it was about 3 billion of spend.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bill, you should think at this point, the ones that we completed AmeriPath... LabOne, which is totally integrated right now; Focus, which is fully integrated. Those are generating returns that are in line with what we had anticipated. There were a lot of synergies involved in the LabOne deal, which we have now fully realized and the Focus transaction, which really about accelerating growth on the hospital side, as well as in the product side, and we are certainly seeing that from that acquisition.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: And how about HemoCue?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: HemoCue is one that is just beginning to ramp up. As you heard, we've got some products that was just approved by the FDA, and that's really a business that we acquire because of its product portfolio and its pipeline of new products, and we expect over the next several years that that's really going to ramp up and be a nice contributor.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And Bill, take for example Focus, we acquired it to be the number one in infectious disease, but we are number one in clinical trails of vaccine. So some things you recognize ahead of time and some times you do certain things and then it provides the accession capabilities at the end of the day. We want to be wherever there is testing, it doesn't really matter who they are; the center piece of the company is going to be testing.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, and then just on the HemoCue mentioning the FDA approval. Can you give us any update on your progress towards getting those tests CLIA waived?
Laure Park - Investor Relations: The applications have been filed and are moving, I guess at the timeline you progress. So, they are moving forward on... once we've got with the FDA clearance, we are able to start actually marketing those in a moderate complexity environment as well even without the CLIA waiver.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. But maybe year end on the CLIA waiver or...
Laure Park - Investor Relations: It's tough to put.
Surya N. Mohapatra - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. It is FDA; so obviously, it is difficult to know the date.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then just I wanted... somebody asked about this, but I guess I am still a little confused than the stack you gave around that the cost savings. I thought I heard you say that you were exiting the year with $100 million and then I thought in previous calls you had said you were at a run rate of $200 million, but I might not be comparing apples-to-apples in the numbers you are giving.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bill, this is Bob. You heard both numbers right, but they are separate numbers. Through the first half as of the end of June, we have reduced our cost structure by approximately $200 million associated with the change in volume from United contract. We then said that on top of that, we are going to reduce our cost by another $500 million by the end of 2009. Of that $500 million we have realized $100 million on an annualized basis as we exited 07, and we are going to see the remainder of that the $400 million or so, realized by the end of 09 or as we exit 09.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, and again that 100 is a net number?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, that's great. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your last question is from Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-up, so I guess just on the spend, Bob, the $0.20 or so. What's the timeframe to do the system implementations, I guess in particular? It sounds like India will be the net investment for a couple of few years. Will IT all be done in 08 or should we expect there will be some more as we look into 09?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There will be more in 09, Tom. The big cost that we are incurring this year is on the development side, and I think we will have all the development done in 08, and then it becomes implementation costs beyond that.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right. Just on 08 guidance, interest expense... can you offer any number there? You said you are going to pay down some debt, and you have got a very fair amount of variable rate and obviously rates have come down a bit. So, can you sort of frame what you are thinking about on that line item?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again, we haven't given guidance on the components, but as you heard we say earlier, you should expect that we are going to continue to reduce our debt levels. And as you know, interest rates are moving down although we have a significant piece of our debt, that's fixed rate. And in fact even a portion of that was floating has been converted to fixed earlier in the year.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: So, do you have a number that's maybe the total that's either variable or fixed at this point including those hedging?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You should be able to take a look at that. We are going to be filing our 10-K later this week and all that details will be laid out in there, but the vast majority of it is fixed.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then I just had one more just to make sure I understand on... I know it's a sensitive issue, but on NID that you talked about, if... as you couldn't come to a settlement, you'd be prepared to litigate, but you've got $241 million reserve at this point. So, I guess just simply is that sort of the minimum we should be thinking about. And if you can come to a settlement, hopefully that's the right range. But if you have to go litigate, obviously the government must be looking for some bigger than that?
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As you see disclosed in the footnote that we have got there, we indicate that that is what we believe the minimum estimate of the liability. But you also heard me say is we are much closer to either settling this or determining that, we are not going to be able to reach a settlement, in which case we are fully prepared to litigate it.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: And when you come to that conclusion, if it's not a settlement and the gross litigation and that will be sort of a newsworthy and I guess you will let us know.
Robert A. Hagemann - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would imagine it would be.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much.

Some of our commentary and answers toquestions may contain forward-looking statements.

A copy of our earnings pressrelease is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be availablelater today in the quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com.A downloadable spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis is alsoavailable on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Laure. During thequarter, we continue to grow our revenue, improve margins and generate strongcash flow. Consolidated revenues grew to $1.08 billion, operating margin grewto 17.3%, a second consecutive quarter of strong improvement, and cash flow wasstrong approaching $300 million. We started the year withuncertainties in a competitive environment with health plans and our ability tomanage costs and growth. We have made excellent progress in reducing thatuncertainty by renewing, and in some cases, extending our relationship withhealth plans. We have aggressively reduced our cost structure while improvingservice and return margins to the level we realized as a contracted provider toUnited. We continue to retainapproximately 25% of the United business and have seen no change in theirassociated discretionary work. This is a clear testament to our strong anddifferentiated value proposition. We have also begun to implement plans tofurther reduce costs by $500 million over the next two years, and we have madeimportant acquisitions, which positions us to accelerate growth. Later I will elaborate on ourgrowth plans, but first, Bob will review our performance and guidance.
Bob Hagemann: Thanks, Surya. As Suryaindicated, we continue to make excellent progress in improving margins over thecourse of the year. Now essentially, back to the profitability levels of lastyear, we are considering the acquisition of AmeriPath. In addition, we've begundiscussions with the government in an effort to reach a settlement regardingits investigation of NID, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary closed in 2006.In connection with these discussions, we've established a reserve of $51million and recorded the charge as part of discontinued operations. We've been working diligently tobring closure to this matter, but it remains unclear as to how long it may takeand what the ultimate cost will be to resolve this issue. Given that we are inongoing discussions regarding this matter, what we can say is limited and iscontained in footnote 8 of the earnings release. In order to assist in making comparisons,as I go through our results, I'll highlight the impact of AmeriPath on a numberof key metrics. In addition to highlight our progress, I'll point downimprovements in certain metrics over the last several quarters. Revenues were $1.8 billion, 11.6%above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing about 13% growth. Revenuesfor our clinical testing business, which accounts for over 90% of our totalrevenues, were 10.6% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing 14%growth. Volume was 2.4% below the prioryear, and approximately 8% below, without the AmeriPath acquisition. Revenueper acquisition increased 13.3%, with 8.5% of the increase due to AmeriPath.The balance of the increase in revenue per acquisition continues to beprimarily driven by a positive test mix. AmeriPath's organic revenuegrowth for the third quarter was 7%, with particular strength indermatopathology and hospital testing. We estimate that consolidated revenueswere reduced by almost 5% due to our change in status with United, withclinical testing volume reduced by about 7%, partially offset by a positiveimpact of revenue per acquisition of about 2%. Positive impact of revenue peracquisition is associated with higher reimbursement on the retained, Unitedwork. Throughout the third quarter we saw little change in our United volumeand continued to remain at about 25% of the previously contracted level. Weexpect that some additional United volume will move overtime due to United'songoing efforts. We continue to be encouraged byphysician's decisions to select Quest Diagnostics when given a choice, and Ihave seen no further loss of discretionary work during the quarter. Adjusted for the changeassociated with Untied, we saw about 1% improvement in our base volume growthcompared to that of the second quarter. Improvement, principally related to ournew Aetna agreement, which went into effectJuly 1. Organic revenue growth in ournon-clinical testing physicians, as a group, which include our clinical trialstesting business and the risks assessment business, was a little over 5% forthe third quarter. The acquisition of HemoCuecontributed 1.5% to consolidated revenue growth. Operating income, as apercentage of revenues, was 17.3% for the quarter compared to 18.5% in theprior year, with the difference due to the acquisition of AmeriPath. Beforeincluding the results of AmeriPath, margins have now returned to the prior yearlevel, only nine months after the contract change with United. This is a further improvement ofabout two full margin points from the year-over-year comparison in the secondquarter, which itself reflects significant improvement from the first quartercomparison. Improvements are due to actions we have taken to reduce our coststructure, avoidance of certain costs incurred in the first quarter, associatedwith business retention and workforce reductions, and higher revenue peracquisition. Bad debt expenses as a percentageof revenues, was 4.8% and 4% before the inclusion of AmeriPath. AmeriPath, whichcarries a higher bad debt rate than the rest of our business, much of it due tothe in patient work done for hospitals and billing systems conversions, willincrease our bad debt expense by about 1% for the time being. At this point wehave not reduced the AmeriPath's bad debt as quickly as we had planned. Howeverthe eventual synergy opportunity related to bad debt remains unchanged. Diluted earnings per share fromcontinuing operations were $0.77 compared to $0.82 in the prior year. Theimpact of the change in contract status with United has been essentiallymitigated. Differences from the prior year is principally due to the AmeriPathacquisition, which will be somewhat more dilutive in the near-term and initialestimates, and in large part, are due to higher bad debt. Included in footnote 6 to theearnings release is a table which summarizes the impact for various measuresfor a number of the items discussed. Cash from operations for thequarter was strong at $291 million, up sharply from Q2 and $56 million abovethe prior year. During the quarter we reduced debt by $152 million, bringingthe total debt reduction since the AmeriPath acquisition to $192 million. Cash at quarter-end was $165million, up $42 million from the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $54million in the quarter and we repurchased $41 million of common stock. Day sales outstanding were 50days, 1 day below the Q2 level and 2 days above the same point last. Theincrease over the last year is due to AmeriPath's impact on our DSOs, which weexpect to decrease overtime. Now, I will turn to our full-yearoutlook for 2007. Our current guidance for results from continuing operationsis as follows, we expect revenues to approximate $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion.We expect operating income as a percentage of revenues to approximate 16%. Thisis reduced by just over 0.5% due to the inclusion of AmeriPath, which currentlycarries lower margins than the rest of our business. We continue to expect cash fromoperations to approximately $800 million, and we expect capital expenditures ofbetween $210 million and $220 million. And lastly, we expect dilutedearnings-per-share, adjusted to exclude the $0.04 in first quarter charges, tobe between $2.84 and $2.91, the mid-point unchanged in previous guidance. Please note these estimatesexclude any additional special charges. Before turning you back to Surya, onelast comment on performance. So far this year is best characterized as one ofsignificant progress in the phase of substantial challenges. Despite the loss of a contractwith our largest private payer, intensified pricing pressures, and an increasedcompetitive environment, we've managed to grow our business and return it toits underlying profitability of the prior year. We have renewed or expanded ourrelationships with a number of important health plans for multi-year periods.We developed plans to redesign and streamline our operations for substantialsavings, totaling $500 million over the next two years. With our recent acquisitions, weput in place the major pieces needed to drive future growth. And our focus isnow on integrating and aligning the capabilities we have assembled, as wedelever and reposition our capital structure for the next wave of growth andinvestment. Now, I will turn it back toSurya.
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks Bob. As you have heard, weare making great progress and are well positioned to drive top and bottom linegrowth. While our business has become much more competitive over the last year,diagnostic testing remains and will always represent a vital healthcareservice. Our strategy based on patients, growth and people, positions us wellto continue to drive profitable growth. We put patients first with thehighest standard for quality and superior service. We give patients andphysicians even more reasons to choose Quest Diagnostics, and we continue todifferentiate ourselves competitively.  Our Patient Service Centers areelectronically connected to physicians' offices and our labs, and are now connectedto patients through electronic appointment scheduling. More than 10% of allvisits to our Patient Service Centers are now scheduled, and adoption continuesto grow more than 50% in some locations. Additionally, we are piloting aportable electronic patient health record called MyCare360. It enables patientsto avoid the need to fill out forms when they visit our Patient ServiceCenters. Patients can also create, storeand manage their own personal health records. We have introduced a new programcalled Quest Care in two markets to make testing available to the uninsured.This compliments our existing needs best testing assistance program andaddresses the unmet need in the market for access to healthcare services. These actions in power patientsassist physicians and add value to health plans and employers. We alsocontinued to raise the bar for quality and safety through technology and LeanSix Sigma. We recently launched a specimen tracking initiative that enables usto accurately track irreplaceable specimens, such as biopsies, at every stageof their journey to our lab. We have joined the NationalePrescribing Patient Safety Initiative, a coalition of healthcare andtechnology companies working to drive improvements in patient care and safety.  Our growth strategies focus onhigh-growth, high-margin production services. We continue to pursue innovativenew tests and technologies that improve quality in patient care. For example,volume for our LEUMETA plasma-based leukemia test more than doubled compared tolast year. The LEUMETA family represents asuite of proprietary tests that one day may replace painful bone marrowbiopsies.  We are the leader in cancerdiagnostics. Together with AmeriPath, we are able to offer a unique combinationthat includes routine testing, anatomic pathology, and molecular diagnostics. We are in the process of aligningthe two organizations to accelerate growth. We continue to lead the industry inadvanced healthcare IT solutions. More than 120,000 doctors use our Care360 forlab orders and results. We are beginning to see traction with physicians usingit to write prescriptions, with more than 100,000 scripts written in September. We are also pursuing growthopportunities outside the United States. Around the world, emerging marketsare creating an educated middle class that can afford private healthcareservices. We are building operations in Indiaand we see opportunities in other countries, such as, the UK and Ireland. In summary, we are drivingtopline growth. We continue to improve margins and we are generating strongcash flow. We are empowering patients and doctors, and creating differentiatedservices to own their trust and loyalty. Within the world of healthcare,diagnostic testing is a critical tool that can detect disease early, drivetreatment decisions early, and improve health. The opportunities are enormousand I am excited about our future. We'll now take your questions.Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions).[Ralph Jacobi] from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ralph Jacobi - Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks. Can you maybe give usmore details around Aetna? How much of thatbusiness is shifted to you all, and maybe the contribution this quarter versusthe year ago quarter?
Bob Hagemann: Just keep in mind with respect toAetna, we have the lion share of that businessalready. The vast majority of what was available to us, has moved to us at thispoint, but again, we didn't see that as a significant volume opportunitybecause of the fact that we had most of the business already. And as Imentioned in the prepared remarks, the Aetnaincrease contributed about 1% improvement in our volume growth in this quartercompared to the second quarter.
Ralph Jacobi - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just looking atorganic growth or actually, I guess I should say, just growth excluding AmeriPathand UNH, it looks like revenue was up around 3.5%, a little below the industryaverage. So, we are just hoping to get some of your comments around that, morethat whether you think that's still a function of UNH distraction or if thereis something else and basically when will we get return?
Bob Hagemann: There is certainly some of that.Yes, we stated in the first quarter and the second quarter, the sales forcehas, for the most part of this year, been focused on business retention asopposed to selling new business. We are starting to shift that over now. And Ithink we are starting to see in the underlying numbers. But it's not somethingthat turns on a dime. But there is no reason for us to believe that we willcontinue to grow organically overtime at/or slightly above the rate of theindustry.
Ralph Jacobi - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from AdamFeinstein with Lehman Brothers. Your line is open.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers:  Okay, thank you. Good morning,everyone and great job in turning around the operations here. Maybe just Bob, Ijust want to get you to elaborate, you mentioned that AmeriPath has beingslightly dilutive for the time being. I just want to make sure I heard youcorrectly as you were talking about the bad debt. Were you implying that thebad debt is going to be worse in the fourth quarter? Was there something thisquarter that led to it being lower, so it will be more dilutive later in theyear? Just wanted to make sure I was following your comments before.
Bob Hagemann: Adam, the point that I wasmaking, it's taking us longer to get at the bad debt improvements, than wethought. A number of AmeriPath systems and their processes are not providing usthe information necessary to make some of the plans that we have actionable atthis time. So, it's taking sometime to get those systems and processes inplace. But as you know, this is an area billing bad debt that we have got someparticular expertise in, and we will get out of it. It's just taking us alittle longer. We're not necessarily anticipating that AmeriPath's bad debt isgoing to go up. It is just that we're not getting at the reductions as quicklyas we would like.
Adam Feinstein - LehmanBrothers: Okay. And then just on that topic, maybe you could just talk alittle bit more. I know you have only asset for that long, but I am certainlyjust curious in terms of, you talked about the bad debt, and maybe just talkabout some other aspects of the bad debt business in terms of the integrationprocess.
Bob Hagemann: I mean, first thing I will tellyou is, there is nothing changed regarding our excitement about theopportunity. The acquisitions were invested to accelerate growth for both QuestDiagnostics and AmeriPath. Remember, accelerating growth was the principalrationale for this deal. And for the most part, yeah, it’s a matter of beingvery deliberate as we integrate the businesses. As we told you, we want to makesure that, we keep the brand identify of AmeriPath intact, particularly on thedemand of pathology side, and we've been very deliberate about the integration.But generally there is nothing there that, we just believe, that the outlookfor this business is any different than we thought it was when we acquired it.
Surya Mohapatra: Adam, this is Surya. If youremember, we acquired AmeriPath because of growth. And we are focusing thecompany on more high-margin, high-growth products and services and cancerdiagnostics is an important area and we are really excited about becoming thenumber one in this area and very, very pleased with the reception we've gotfrom AmeriPath doctors and their employees.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: All right. And then just a finalquestion here is just on some of the cost cutting. Last quarter, you had saidthat, you've got a $20 million run rate in terms of what you had alreadyimplemented, and then you have touched on $500 million in future periods. I justwant to see if you have any update there, and just any additional thoughts oncost cutting. Thank you.
Bob Hagemann: Nothing specific to add to whatwe've said before. We continue obviously to manage costs pretty aggressively, butat the same time being very focused on maintaining the service levels that wehave got, because we see those services levels as one of the principledifferentiators that we bring to our customers. We've continued to reduce thesize of the work force, most of it through voluntary attritions. And as we look at the $500million in savings that we expect to get over the next several years, certainlya significant piece of that is going to come from reduced people cost. Butagain, we expect that we will get that through normal attrition over the nextseveral years, and we feel good about being able to get it. It's starting toshow up in the numbers, as you can see. And yeah, I think our focus has to beon continuous improvement in both our efficiency, as well as our servicelevels.
Adam Feinstein - LehmanBrothers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from BillBonello from Wachovia Securities. Your line is open.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Yeah. Hey, good morning. Coupleof questions. It looks like if we strip out AmeriPath and United then yourrevenue per requisition was up about 2.5%, being a little better than that andeven after excluding those, is that a pretty reasonable expectation for theunderline increase, going forward? Or are there any price cuts that younegotiated, but that haven’t takeneffect yet, which could potentially bring it down a little bit?
Bob Hagemann: Bill, as you know, we don’tprovide guidance on revenue per requisition growth or volume growth. We try tomanage the business for profitable revenue growth overall. And there will betimes when we can come to agreement on a particular contract and, as such,might walk away with all the impact of volume. But in the end, I think it willhelp our overall profitability in many cases. So, I would rather not start nowgiving guidance on revenue per rack or volume. Rather point you to the factthat we believe organic revenue growth, overtime, will continue to grow at orslightly above the industry rate. And as you know, as we have gone throughthese managed care negotiations, we have had to make some pricing concessionsand hopefully, with much of that behind us now, we will start to see somestability.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: And that's all I am trying tounderstand is, is this quarter's results pretty representative of whateverpricing concessions you know that you have to make?
Bob Hagemann: Yet again, you are asking me togive you guidance on revenue per rack. I think we are going to continue to seepressure on price as we go forward and frankly that's one of the reasons thatwe embarked on this program, to pull $500 million in costs out of our business,because that's going to allow us to continue to drive towards that 20%operating income that we have spoken about.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. That's helpful, and thenjust, I am little confused by the volumes stat you drew out. I just wanted tomake sure I understand what you were getting at, if AmeriPath, if ex ofAmeriPath, your volume was down about 80%, I thought you said that sort of ex United,you were growing volume about 1%. Something is not matching up, are you saying that there was maybe about a2% impact from business that you lost, that you sort of attributed, it wasn'tUnited, but it was sort of attributable to having lost the United contract?
Surya Mohapatra: No, Bill. What I am saying iswhen you strip out acquisitions and then you strip out the impact of United theunderlying year-over-year volume growth that we saw in the third quarter wasabout a point better than we saw in the second quarter.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Well, in the second it was apoint better than what you saw in the second quarter, okay but not necessarilypositive?
Surya Mohapatra: Correct.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, great. That's very helpful.Thank you.
Operator: Out next question comes from BillQuirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray: Hey everybody, its Dave Clairhere for Bill. How are you?
Surya Mohapatra: Very good.
Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray: Hey, just a question oncompetitive bidding, with the first competitive bidding demonstration siteannounced, I was hoping if you could give us your initial thoughts on theprocess and any expectations for impact to the San Diego business?
Laure Park: Well, we really [came] here withthe first site out there obviously we are evaluating and looking at the wholeprocess. We still have concerns with the process and we are working through albeit,through the appropriate channels. That being said the addition in the naming ofthe first site doesn't change our belief that competitive bidding is noteverything for the industry and we are continuing to work through ACLA to getthat message out and obviously are hopeful that some of the bills introduced inCongress will have an impact.
Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, just on kind of theinternational front, you guys talked about India,and the UK and Ireland are lookingattractive. Are there any additional emerging markets that you guys are lookingat? And just on the Indiafront is, that going to be strictly processing India testing volume or you aregoing to thinking about outsourcing anything from the States?
Surya Mohapatra: Dave, this is Surya. First ofall, we are looking at international very seriously but we are focusing ondeveloping countries rather than developed countries. That means Asia and South America. We have started building our operations inIndia.The middle class population is 300 million people there and there is a lot ofprivate payers. And we are building the business first to address the localmarket, there is tremendous opportunity there, and we will concentrate and putour expertise and the experience to make ourselves a leader there. And afterthat, obviously we are looking at other opportunities. We have some smalloperations in UK and Mexico,and as you know we had some work from the Irish government to reduce ourbacklog. So the international opportunity is really a growth opportunity, andin five to six years you will see a significant traction there.
Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then just kind of onAmeriPath, going forward, it was a little bit [lighter] than what we arelooking for over here, just your thoughts, and what you expect as kind of alonger-term growth rate for that business?
Bob Hagemann: We haven't given any specificguidance on the growth rate for that business, but the two areas that they arefocused on are dermatopathology, anatomic pathology in general; and specialtytesting. They are two of the fastest growing areas in clinical testing and wedon't see any reason for that to change, certainly demographics are drivingsome of that growth.
Surya Mohapatra:  They are growing at 7% which issomething we had in that sector, which is higher than clinical pathology.
Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next question comes from RobertWilloughby from Banc of America Securities. Sir, you may ask your question.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Just a clarification on that, yousaid it grew 7%, I thought you did have a 10% growth expectation out there forAmeriPath, am I just remembering wrong?
Bob Hagemann: I am not sure we ever put 10%growth expectation out there. I think we have generally said the 17% range orso. And actually, in this quarter, even though we reported 7% when you look atthe business days impact, it's almost right on top of the last quarter growthfor us.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And just the plans for thecash, I was bit surprised by the share repurchase in the quarter, are we likelyto see more of that or really is the de-leveraging here the priority? And anychange on your view on when acquisitions again are likely?
Bob Hagemann: Well, as I said to you, when we didthe AmeriPath acquisition, we committed to our vendors to improve our creditstats, as part of the penny in the AmeriPath financing. We think that's theprudent thing to do. We want to get back within what I will call the creditparameters that we had previously used. And once we are within thoseparameters, the first objective is to invest our cash into growthopportunities, as we believe that generates sustainable cash flows.  And then secondly, when they arenot available at the right price, we will then divert it into sharerepurchases. But right now, and for the time being, you should expect thatshare repurchases are going to be at a much more modest level, until we get thecredit stats back inline with where we were.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: And I think Surya had said that18 months was a likely timeframe to be out of the acquisition market is thatcorrect or--?
Bob Hagemann: Well, we are not going to becompletely out of the acquisition market, that's important to understand. In fact, we did a small acquisition thisquarter, which added to our MedPlus operations, an important one with respectto healthcare IT. But we don't expect to be doing large acquisitions over thenext 12 to 18 months or so.
Surya Mohapatra:  We still have that calendar,Robert.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from ArtHenderson from Jefferies & Company. You may ask your question.
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Hi. Good morning. Kind offollowing up on what Bob was just asking there. Bob, in your guidance, do youhave share buybacks in those numbers and sort of anticipated debt repaymentlevels?
Bob Hagemann: We do, and again, I have notprovided specific guidance for either share repurchases or debt repayment. Thecash that we generate over the course of the year will principally go into debtrepayment, but it will be potentially in modest share repurchases. But we'vehistorically not given specific guidance on share repurchases.
Art Henderson - Jeffeies & Company: Okay, that’s fair. And then --
Bob Hagemann: Cash to work.
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Yeah. Understood. Okay, thanks.And then one other question, looking ahead, obviously this last year was a bigcontract renewal year. How much contract renewal activity do you have nextyear?
Bob Hagemann: Well, certainly not nearly asmuch as this year. Almost 60% of our managed care patients which was contractedcoming into the year has been renewed and with the majority of that undermultiyear agreements and in some of those extending until 2010. So 2008, iscertainly not going to be the sort of year that we had here, but keep in mindthat we have probably as much as a third or so of our managed care business,that is, either one-year agreements, or actually not contracted. So we aredealing with that on a regular basis all the time.
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay. And then one last question,it appeared, I guess, from the commentary you made earlier that you reallyhaven’t yet started tapping into $500 million of opportunity that’s out therefrom a cost-savings standpoint. Is that a fair assessment, is it something thatwe are going to see more, later on down the road, or where do you stand onthat?
Bob Hagemann: We certainly had started tappinginto it. We've started to deploy some of those actions and, in fact, that'swhat's gotten us to where we are at in terms of the operating marginimprovement that you see in this quarter. But the vast majority in that isstill to come, and we will see a significant piece of it in '08 and anothersignificant chunk in '09. And as we said, we expect that $500 million to be therun rate savings that we generate actually into '09.
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay. One last question I'll jumpback in the queue. On AmeriPath, I know you guys have talked about operatingthat business at least for the short-term, somewhat separately from the maincore business. At what point do you start thinking about bringing it in moreformally?
Surya Mohapatra: First of all, that is actually amain business for us. I think when we say that we are going to use itseparately, we wanted to make sure that the service quality and the clientservices and the brand image and all those things remain intact. But they areintegrated in the company as far as finance, legal and compliance, and we arealigning the two sales organizations to accelerate growth. But also AmeriPathhas facilities and we are integrating this facility with Nichols Institute. So,they are an integral part of the company, but we are going to focus more onhospital and esoteric and cancer diagnostics. That’s the reason why we want torun a little bit differently from what we've done in the clinical business.
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay, great. Great work. Nicequarter.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from KempDolliver from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Hi, thanks, and good morning.With AmeriPath, over what timeframe do you think you will be in the position tostart driving the accelerated sales growth that you are looking for?
Bob Hagemann: We have just started integratingthe organization and the first one we are doing is at the facility in NicholsInstitute. And we will, probably in the next couple of quarters, will see moreand more of that integration to strengthen our product offering. So this is notactually a synergy story, but this is actually how do you really grow. How doyou keep our 400 pathologists from AmeriPath, and another 400 pathologists fromQuest Diagnostics, busy and engaged with the patients?
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Great. Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes fromAndreas Dirnagl from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andreas Dirnagl - JP Morgan: Yeah. Good morning. Most of myquestions have been answered, but Surya, I was wondering, maybe just a littlebit more color on India.I guess you are about six months away from completing construction. I justwanted to see what you are expectations were there. And then also, maybe just some thoughts aboutwhat appears to be kind of a "do it alone" strategy, as opposed to bemaybe joint venturing or even buying a local operator?
Surya Mohapatra: Okay. Good question, Andreas.First of all, I've always said there are 300 million middle class in Indiaand frankly, there is so much discretionary expenses that they can provide forhealthcare services. But the issue in India is who can bring high qualitytest technology which is not available and create a diagnostic service whichpeople can trust. And that's the reason why we have decided to do it alonerather than buying any local businesses, because our business model is going tobe different from other business models. Apart from just doing the routinetesting, we'll be doing esoteric testing. We will have a test menu for clinicaltrials, so this is going to be a full-fledge laboratory to provide services todifferent segments of customers. Now as far as acquisition and JV,as we establish ourselves and create the value system, then we will see what isavailable. But we want to establish a completely new diagnostic testing servicewhich will bring trust, transparency and technology to the Indian healthcaresystem.
Andreas Dirnagl - JP Morgan: Great. And just to confirm, itwill be about six months until you are up and running there.
Surya Mohapatra:  That’s our target.
Andreas Dirnagl - JP Morgan: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Surya Mohapatra:  Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from RickyGoldwasser with UBS. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Thank you. Good morning. Just acouple of follow-up questions. First of all, on the AmeriPath bad debt, I thinkyou said that the synergy opportunity is unchanged. Can you just quantify forus are you looking to get the AmeriPath bad debt levels down to Queststandalone levels, or what number are you looking for? And then secondly, follow up onthe managed care contracts, and as you said that 60% of managed care businessis renewed in the third of demand care business, is that in annual renewals oris non-contracted. And while I anticipate your answer that you don’t talk aboutspecific contracts, without getting into details, just for us to understand, isthe managed in the outstanding bucket in the third or should we factor it inthe 60% of increasing renewals?
Bob Hagemann:  Okay. Let me start with AmeriPathand the opportunity that we have identified there is to reduce their bad debt.Although, we don’t expect that we will be able to get it to the level of QuestDiagnostics, simply because of their business mix, the fact that they do a lotof in-patient hospital work, and there is some indigent work in there. So, itwill always be somewhat higher than we have, as a result of that. But on therest of the business, there is no reason that we can't get it down to thelevels of Quest Diagnostics. And as we bring our processes there and as wedeploy the new systems that they are rolling out, we see opportunity to get atthat. We haven't given specific guidance on what that bad debt number would be,because we haven't given any specific guidance on cost synergies there. Butjust remember, cost synergies were not the principal driver behind thisacquisition. It's the opportunity to accelerate growth over the long-term.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Now Bob, just as a follow up onthe bad debt, have you seen any negative impact from the bad debt side that isrelated to United?
Bob Hagemann: We saw in the first quarter. Wesaw some. And we have quantified that for you. But since then, I would say thatUnited has not had a significant impact on our bad debt. They have beenreimbursing us pretty timely and appropriately for the work that we have beenperforming. And with respect to managed care contracts in Humana, Ricky, youhave guessed right. Your intuition is very good. We don't comment on specificcontracts, but we expect that we will continue to be a contracted provider toHumana, but that is still being worked out.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from TomGallucci. Your line is open from Merrill Lynch.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning,everybody. Just a couple of follow ups as well. Bob, you were talking beforeabout seeing new organic revenue growth similar or better than the industry.Where would you pick industry revenue growth out of at this point?
Bob Hagemann: Pull it around 5% or so, overall.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then also on use ofcash, you said you wanted to sort of get back to the credit parameters that youused to talked about. Can you just maybe make sure that we are clear on sort ofwhat your goal is there, in terms of the specific parameter?
Bob Hagemann: What I would tell you isgenerally, we really don’t want to amount debt to EBITDA to be much over two ina quarter times for an extended period. And that's what we are targeting to getback. Certainly, if I look at it from a balance sheet perspective, when I lookat debt to total capital, we'll be back there sooner, the upper end to thatrange was around 50% and move back within that sooner, but the debt to EBITDAnumbers could take us a little longer to get back to.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then you also talkedabout the cost cutting in, sort of voluntary attrition. What areas really, Iguess when you think about efficiency and reducing the work force, what areashave the bulk of the cuts been made or do you anticipate making just so we canget a better understanding of really what's changing internally at Quest?
Bob Hagemann: That will certainly hit themajority of the costs that have come out from our laboratories and theinfrastructure that supports those labs, the logistics, et cetera. We've reallynot done anything in terms of reducing PSCs and in fact we've added PSCs overthe course of the year to expand our access there. And as time goes by what wewill continue to do is streamline the way we operate the existing labs and thepatient service centers. We've mentioned Lean in the past.We are deploying Lean principles in a number of our laboratories, which help usto make better use of our existing capacity, and I think I previously mentionedthat we don't expect to have significant facility closures as a result of this.We believe that the redesign that we are doing will allow us to make better useof our existing capacity. Then on top of that there areareas like purchasing, billing, logistics are the administrative activitiesthat we've looked at, and we're taking action there as well.
Surya Mohapatra: Let me make in the comment on, asI said, we started the year with a lot of uncertainty, with the health plan butmore on [centers new laws], can we really take costs out, can we grow, and thecost reductions related to the United volume has gone very well, and we areback to the margin as we had with the contract. But also, I wanted to reallyemphasize although people are talking about cost cutting, the $500 million isactually the deliberate process to take work out and redesign our laboratories,so that amount is gone for good. So that includes the use of Six Sigma, LeanSix Sigma and technology and it is going to take a couple of years. But oncewe've done that, we will have a different type of operational organization thanwhat we had before. But in any case we are not going to do anything that'sgoing to change our risk level and our value proposition for patients and thephysicians.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you. And then I hadjust one another one, I know again not talking a lot about the specificcontracts, but I think you did expand your relationship in Ohio with MedicalMutual. I was just trying to gauge, how should we think about that? What thatcan contribute to growth sort of in the coming quarters or year?
Surya Mahapatra:  Well, certainly it is animportant relationship, but I would tell you that it's not going to besignificant, in that, you'll see a material change in our numbers as a resultof it. It's important to get access there, but it's a relatively smallopportunity, relative to some of the others.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Even relative to some of theincremental and the business, which you already had the lion's share, but thatdid seem to make a difference on volume?
Surya Mahapatra: Yeah, I would say so.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Before we go to our next question(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Bill Bonello fromWachovia Securities.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Just a follow-up. Can you tell uswhether HemoCue and Focus are contributing positively to earnings at thispoint?
Bob Hagemann: It is very modest Bill. It'sneither accretive nor dilutive at this point. I think with both HemoCue and Focuswe expect that overtime we'll see increased contributions there, but they arereally not big enough to have a significant impact either way right now.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay, and do you anticipate thatat some point in time that they could have a significant contribution?
Bob Hagemann: We certainly expect that we'llsee accelerated growth on the HemoCue side. Point of care, we believe is goingto be a big growth opportunity for us, and that carries higher margins in therest of the business, so I expect that it will be accretive and certainly Focushas products as well, which is going to drive growth. But in terms ofsignificant, I don't necessarily see those two businesses as drivingsignificant accretion. But over time, I think you'll see that in our point ofcare business, as it continues to grow and as we look at other opportunitiesthere beyond, Focus and HemoCue could contribute significant growth toearnings.
Surya Mahapatra: Right and when we bought HemoCue,we said that we are creating the platform HemoCue, Enterix and FocusDiagnostics to create and make available products which will be used in thedoctor's office, in the hospital and at the patient bedside, and that remainsas a platform. And as we move forward, we will add some other products to thatparticular platform, which will be a significant platform for us in comingyears.
Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are the copyrighted property with Quest Diagnostics with All Rights Reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this a call in any form without the expressed written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.  Now I would like to introduce Laure Park, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please. 
Laure Park: Thank you and good morning. I am here with Surya Mohapatra, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hagemann, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of our commentary and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to be materially different. Certain of these risks and uncertainties, may include, but are not limited to competitive environment, changes in government regulations, change in relationship of customers, payers, the buyers and strategic partners, and other factors described in the 2006 Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the quarterly update section of our website, at www.questdiagnostics.com. A downloadable spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Surya Mohapatra. 
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you, Laure. We made significant progress in the second quarter and our business is getting stronger. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy. We signed a number of important managed care agreements; we have recognized a differentiated level of service we provide. We improved the efficiency of our operations, and we are the leader in clinical pathology, gene-based and esoteric testing, now with AmeriPath we have become the undisputed leader in anatomic pathology.  We use Sigma and Lean principles and technology capabilities to drive operational excellence in our laboratories. We have identified opportunities to improve efficiency and further reduce costs by $500 million over the next two years. This will allow us to expand margins in the phase of pricing pressures and continue to invest in growth.  During the second quarter, consolidated revenues grew to $1.6 billion; operating margin was 16.6% of revenue and improvement of more than 3% from the first quarter largely a result of actions we have to taken to reduce costs and higher revenue for acquisition. And we continue to generate considerable cash flow.  We continue to drive organic growth by leveraging sales service and science. We executed a number of important health plan contracts. We renewed agreements with Coventry and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. We extended our agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida. We signed new agreements with Medical Mutual of Ohio, and Culinary Health Fund in Las Vegas.  We signed a multiyear contract extension with Sigma Healthcare and we have been working with Aetna to improvement to our expanded contract, which was effective July 1st. Having the large contracts signed, has improved our visibility and reduced uncertainty in this competitive environment.  We differentiate our services by continually enhancing our value proposition. That includes superior patient experience, Six Sigma quality, unparalleled access and convenience, innovative tests and our advanced IT Solutions. For example, waiting time for patients in virtually all of our patient service centers is under 20 minutes, and can be significantly less for patients who use our electronic appointment scheduling system.  In our most recent customer satisfaction survey, physicians continue to rate our service higher than the competition. We continue to enhance service by deploying a unique specimen tracking system, enhancing our hospital and physician's connectivity and introducing cash collection in our patient service centers.  And the use of our Care360 continues to grow, with more than 115,000 physician users.  Our superior service and quality have been honored with the prestigious Governor's Sterling Award in Florida, which is based on the National Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence.  Our focus scientific innovation to create unique and exclusive tests is driving growth. For example, LEUMETA plasma-based testing provides an alternative to painful bone marrow biopsies. During the quarter, we added new tests to this growing family, with revenue double compared to 2006. We are the only national lab to offer ImmunoCap Allergy Testing, which has been shown to the significantly more accurate than other tests and continue to grow.  HerpeSelect from Focus Diagnostics is the best selling diagnostic product in the market for Herpes Simplex Virus, with revenues doubling over the prior year. We led the development of use of LC-tandem mass spect, to enhance vitamin D and testosterone testing, which is growing in high double digits year-over-year.  We recently launched the only automated test for Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation. This has the potential to provide circulation based testing and drive future growth.  We are very excited about the opportunities to excellent growth in anatomic pathology, by combining with AmeriPath. We have begun to join our company, in a way that preserves the uniqueness of AmeriPath. Since the acquisition was completed on May 31, my staff and I have traveled around the country to meet with the pathologists, management and employees. They are very supportive and excited about the opportunities for our combined company. At Quest Diagnostics, we now have a medical and scientific staff, comprising approximately 900 MDs and PhDs, including some of the world's luminaries in the major of diagnostic disciplines.  Now I would like to turn it over to Bob, who will provide analysis on our results before I come back with some additional comments. 
Bob Hagemann: Thanks Surya. As Surya noted, during the second quarter, we have made excellent progress in building on the momentum which we established exiting the first quarter. Our progress in clearly reflected in our operating results, and provides us increased confidence regarding the outlook for our business.  Given that the acquisition of AmeriPath, which is included in our results as of June 1, has affected a number of our metrics. I will highlight each impact, as I go through the results.  In addition, to highlight our progress, I will point out improvements in certain metrics compared to the first quarter.  Revenues were $1.6 billion, 3.7% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing about 4.5% growth. Revenues for our clinical testing business, which accounts for over 90% of our total revenues, were 2.1% above the prior year, with AmeriPath contributing 4.8%.  Volume was 6% below the prior year, and approximately 8% below without the AmeriPath acquisition. Revenue per acquisition increased 8.6% with 3.1% of the increase due to AmeriPath. The balance of the increase in revenue per acquisition continues to be primarily driven by a positive mix shift, and an increase in the number of tests ordered per acquisition.  AmeriPath's organic revenue growth for the second quarter was almost 8%, with particular strength in dermatopathology and hospital testing. We estimate that consolidated revenues were reduced by about 4.5% due to our changing status with United, with clinical testing volumes reduced by about 7%, partially offset by a positive impact of revenue per acquisition of about 2%.  Positive impact of revenue per acquisition is associated with higher reimbursement on the retained United work, with almost 0.5% of the second quarter increase, associated with a true-up in United's rates. The year-to-date impact of the United on revenue per acquisition is a positive 1.5%.  As of the end of the second quarter, we estimate that about 75% of the United volume has moved to other contracted providers, compared to about 70% at the end of March. We expect that some additional United volume will move before the end of the year, due to United's ongoing efforts.  We continue to be encouraged by physician's decisions to select Quest Diagnostics when they are given a choice; we have seen no further loss of this questionnaire work during the second quarter. With our sales force now focus on winning new accounts and so additional tests coupled with a new agreement which went to effect July 1, we expect to see further improvement in year-over-year comparisons as the year progresses. Revenues in our non-clinical test business is as a group which include our clinical trials business and the risk assessment business acquired as a part of map one were up slightly from the second quarter of last year.  The acquisition of Focus Diagnostics, Interex and HemoCue, contributed about 2% consolidated revenue growth.  Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 16.6% for the quarter compared to 18.8% in the prior year. Margins were reduced by about 40 basis points due to the acquisition of AmeriPath, therefore the more comparable margin percentage reflected a decrease of 1.8%. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter comparison, in which margins were down 3.5% compared to the prior year.  The improvement, which we expect to continue as the year progresses, is due to actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure, the avoidance of certain costs incurred in the first quarter associated with the business retention and workforce reductions, and higher revenue per acquisition in the second quarter.  Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues was 4.3% and 4% before the inclusion of AmeriPath. The 4% rate compares favorably to the 4.4% rate in Q1. AmeriPath, which carries a higher bad debt rate than the rest of our business much of it due to the inpatient work done for hospitals, will increase our bad debt expense in the back half of the year by about 1%. Although it is unlikely that we will be able to reduce AmeriPath's bad debt to the rate we maintain for the rest of our business, because of their business mix. This is one of the areas we have identified as a synergy opportunity.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.73 compared to $0.78 in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the changing contract status with United. The impact of which was significantly mitigated in the second quarter compared to that in the first quarter.  Keep in mind that last year's second quarter included $0.04 charge to write-down an investment. Included in footnote seven to the earnings release is a table which summarizes the impact of various measures for a number of the items discussed.  Cash from operations was $129 million and was reduced by $57 million of the fees and other expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of AmeriPath. Cash flow adjusted for these payments was strong and compares favorably with the $170 million reported in the prior year.  During the quarter, we made capital expenditures of $49 million and invested $2 billion in the AmeriPath acquisition. Permanent financing for the AmeriPath acquisition consists of a five year bank term loan and the proceeds from a very successful offering of 10 year and 30 year notes, which was completed on June 22. $90 million of the term loan was repaid towards the end of June.  We were out of the market for repurchasing shares throughout the second quarter due to all the activities associated with the closing and the financing that transaction. We plan to resume repurchasing shares in the third quarter, but had to reduce the level until we achieve some of the expected improvement in our credit statistics.  Day sales outstanding were 51 days, 4 days above the Q1 level was all of the increase associated with AmeriPath. We expect AmeriPath's impact on our DSOs to decrease to approximately two days by year end and less than that over time.  Before moving to full year guidance, I'll take a few minutes to put our progress in perspective. We had an excellent track record of driving growth and revenues, earnings cash flows and shareholder value. Coming into this year, we indicated that 2007 will be a year of adjustment due to our contract change with United and intensified pricing pressure resulting from a heightened competitive environment. Yet despite the near term challenges we face we have remained committed to a strategy that we believe will deliver superior long-term performance and shareholder returns.  While we will continue to face challenges, the progress we have made has given us better visibility on a number of uncertainties and reinforced our confidence in the long-term prospects for our business. First while facing intense pressure from a major competitor and a number of payers to commoditize our business we remain committed to providing a superior service level to patients, physicians and other customers. As a result we were able to renew and in some cases expand our relationships with a number of important health plans. In each case on economic terms, which work for both parties and at prices, which recognize the differentiated level of service we provide.  But there remained a number of managed care agreements that we will renew over the next six months. We now have contracts in place accounting for almost 60% of our contracted managed care business we had coming into the year with most of the newly contracted business extending into 2010 or beyond. This gives us much improved visibility in terms of access and pricing for this contracting cycle.  We have also taken actions to adjust our cost structure to the new volume levels. We've reduced the size for our workforce in the clinical testing business by over 2000 during the last six months, or maintaining and in some cases improving service levels. We've now pulled out over $200 million in annualized costs. However, we need to do more than adjust costs in connection with changes in volume, if we are to expand margins in a highly competitive environment. As such we have done extensive analysis of all of our business processes and identified specific opportunities some of which we've already begun to realize, which will reduce annual costs by another $500 million over the next two years.  Much of the savings will come from streamlining the way we operate our existing reliance in patient service centers, not necessarily from reducing capacity and certainly not in reducing service levels. In addition, redesigns of the way we do purchasing, billing, logistics as well as how we operator our administrative functions will contribute to significant savings. One time costs anticipated in achieving our savings had not been finalized and are not netted in the $500 million.  In addition we’ve made excellent progress in executing our growth strategy. Over the past 12 months we’ve completed the acquisitions for AmeriPath, HemoCue, Interex and Focus Diagnostics, and have in place major elements easy to drive future growth. Our focus will now turn to fully integrating and aligning the capabilities of these companies and those acquired from LabOne to fully realize the synergy and growth opportunities they create.  Accordingly, we expect limited acquisition spending during the next 12 to 18 months. With key elements of our growth strategy in place our focus is now on forward execution and operational excellence.  In connection with the AmeriPath financings, we committed to our vendors to improve our credit metrics over the next 12 months. We expect that much of that improvement were result from improved operating performance and some debt repayment. As our operating performance continues to improve and we continue to gain better visibility into our projected performance, it will afford us the ability to direct more of our cash flows and balance sheet capacity into share repurchases. And although, I'm not currently in a position to commit to a minimum level of share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months, we are committed to maximizing shareholder returns by driving operating performance and practicing prudent capital management.  Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2007. Our current guidance for results in continuing operations is as follows. We expect revenues to approximate $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion the increase in previous guidance is principally due to the AmeriPath acquisition. We expect operating income, as a percentage of revenues to approximate 16%. In addition AmeriPath, which currently carries lower margins in the rest of our business. We've reduced margins by about 1% in each of the last two quarters and about 0.5% for the year.  We continue to expect cash from operations to approximate $800 million, this is net of $57 million of fees and expenses paid in the second quarter in connection with the acquisition of AmeriPath. And we expect capital expenditure in between $210 million and $220 million. And lastly, we expect diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the $0.04 in first quarter charges to be between $2.80 and $2.95; this reflects modest dilution from AmeriPath, which we expect will become modestly accretive next year.  Please note, the estimates exclude any additional charges related to potential restructuring activities. Now, I'll turn it back to Surya. 
Surya Mohapatra: Thanks Bob. As you have heard, we are making progress driving growth top and bottom line growth. We continue to be focused on high growth areas, like cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. We are growing our business in these areas and diversifying our revenue stream.  Today as a $7 billion company, we generated about 35% of our revenues or almost $2.5 billion from high growth areas such as gene-based and esoteric testing and anatomic pathology. This compares to about 25% or up recently $1 billion in 2002 when we were a $4 billion company.  In addition to organic growth, we have used acquisitions to drive change in our industry and growth in our company. Our acquisition of SBCL changed the game in clinical pathology and the physician business. The combination of AML and our Nichols Institute created unmatched capabilities and drove growth in our hospital business.  Now with AmeriPath we have the opportunity to again change the game and take advantage of the convergence of anatomic pathology, clinical pathology and molecular diagnostics. Key elements of our growth strategy are now in place. We are the clear leader in a number of high growth testing areas and we provide the most comprehensive and integrated diagnostic offering overall anywhere in the world.  In summary, our business is getting stronger; we continue to improve on an already differentiated service offering. We assigned a number of important managed care agreements and we are making major improvements in the efficiency of our operations and we remain committed to our longer term goals of driving profitable growth and delivering superior sales over the terms.  We'll now take your questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Feinstein with Lehman Brothers. Sir, your line is open. 
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you, good morning everyone. Just a few questions here, it seems like the biggest change from the first quarter. As you guys did a great job in terms of really cutting your cost, it seems like you have lots of the UNH business in the first quarter added. Big impact on margins and ones can -- as you guys highlighted a fair job cutting their cost. I just wanted to get provided on some more detail there. I know you spoke about the run-rate. Then Bob, I just wanted to get to go back through that and the opportunity going forward. And then just also wanted to see if you could just also comment in terms of the pull-through, as you mentioned you have watched about 75% of the UNH business. But I just want to see if there were any more details about the pull-through and the impact from the associate revenue as well. Thank you. 
Bob Hagemann: Well Adam, you may recall in the first quarter that we talked about our cost whether or not they are fixed or variable. We said in the short-term, let's call it six months or so, about 60% of our cost are variable. And what we have been doing over the last six months is really adjusting those cost levels. As I mentioned earlier we have reduced our FTEs or full time equivalence by 2000 since the beginning of the year, and most of that is through normal attrition and managing the way we add people to the workforce. Obviously, there are other costs which go away as the volume goes away, supplies cost, bad debt etc. etc. But we have been very deliberate in the way we manage the cost structure in the first half of the year to make sure that we are not impacting service levels.  The odd thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter we incurred some extra costs to try and retain business and we said we did not expect those to occur again in the second quarter. So it's really a combination of avoiding some of those costs that we incurred in the first quarter to retain business and the continued progress that we have made in pulling out what I'll call some of the variable costs in the short-term during this next quarter here.  And in terms of pull through, I would say it hasn’t changed. I mean, we have not seen any additional loss of this discretionary work and to us that's a very good sign that physicians when they have a choice want to continue to use Quest Diagnostics. 
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay and just on that point is still the 4 to 1 ratio that you had mentioned -- 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah, actually the ratio is improving a little bit, because we are not losing any additional discretionary work yet we’ve lost a little bit more of the United work. 
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then just back on the costing savings part. So you had identified additional $500 million over the next two years. Can you just talk about the timing of this cost savings, so we can think about that and then just want to make sure I had the correct numbers in terms of just the cost savings in terms that you've already implemented in terms of what the run rate is? 
Bob Hagemann: Well in terms of the run rate of cost savings it's about $200 million on an annualized basis that we have already taken out. On top of that we expect to reduce costs by roughly another $500 million on an annual basis by the time we get to the end of 2009. And you're going to see that actually come in over the next several years. We've got a little bit back of that in 2007, but we are going to see that ramp up in 2008 and in 2009. These actions are really designed to help the drive operating income to that 20% of revenues over time that we have committed to. Some of the savings gets us the structural cost reductions required to offset a loss of the United volume, which I have previously talked about. Some of it is to offset the pricing pressure that we are seeing and some of it is to allow us to invest in growth and further service differentiation as we continue to grow the business. 
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, just a final question from me and then I will get into the queue here. I just wanted to get some commentary. You guys certainly sound a lot more optimistic about the industry environment. I guess earlier end of the year on the call in some of the presentations you guys seem to have little bit negative I guess it's about the competitive environment. So just wanted to, might just get your thoughts it seems like things have definitely improved and you signed a lot of contracts in the most recent quarters. So was just curious in terms of as [Bob] said in terms of the terms of the contracts have they been better then what you were thinking back and to be getting up on the year and I guess what I'm getting at is, there is lot of concern about a price war earlier this year, but it seems to be dying down, just wanted to see what your expectations are there? Thank you. 
Surya Mohapatra: Well, Adam as I said in the beginning or the year that it was going to be a period of uncertainty, but now that we have signed a lot of major contracts including CIGNA and Aetna, we feel that a number of uncertainties have been reduced. We also feel that managed care organizations are different. They are not buying only one strategy, which is a long term contract with transaction fee. So we feel very happy that each managed care organizations have their way for differentiating themselves and we are providing that value propositions to them and as Bob said that we've almost 66% of the contracts are signed. So that has cleared up a lot of uncertainties. As far as competitiveness is concerned we still will have some challenges in front of us and I think pricing is always going to be under pressure but [obviously] highly propositions, which is really going to help us win. And nothing is like signing a long number of contracts and that's what we have done over the last six months and we feel pretty encouraged and confident that what happened in October is a disruption not a trend. 
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you very much, I appreciate the detail. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Bill Bonello with Wachovia, sir your line is open. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Yeah, couple of questions. I'm sorry, but first little bit just I want to be absolutely crystal clear. Bob that you are saying the $500 million is above and beyond the $200 million that you have already achieved so think of it since the beginning of this year through the end of '09 something on the order of $700 million of savings? 
Bob Hagemann: That's correct. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Okay. And then you mentioned that the increased excluding AmeriPath as the increased in revenue per acquisition was largely driven by mix and the number of test per acquisition, just wondering if you can give us any sense of what the revenue per test would have been up on a year-over-year basis or some sense of what happen on pure price basis, excluding mix and test? 
Bob Hagemann: And you know Bill, over the years that the improvement in revenue per acquisition has not really been driven by pure price, it's really been driven by mix shift, mix some test and the number of test order per acquisition. And that really continues now, we have not seen any significant increases in price per test. And as I've mentioned we are seeing a continued pricing pressure that's not necessarily going away, although we do feel good in that now we've signup a whole bunch of managed care agreements and we believe that although the economic terms work for both parties, it also recognized the fact that we do provide a differentiated level of service. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Can you give us any kind of sense of the magnitude of the actual price pressure that you've incurred? 
Bob Hagemann: Bill for obvious reasons, I don't want to get into talk in about price too much, at this point I don't think that it's a wise thing for us to do, but as I said, I think we had economic terms that we were able to workout for both the payer and our self as we went through each of these contract negotiations. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Okay. And then, just on the cash flow, can you tell us, it look like operating -- as you said operating cash flow would actually have been up year-over-year without the AmeriPath despite a lower net income and just turning to understand what driving that cash flow improvement? 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah, some of it is just the timing of payments and what not but obviously we are very focused on cash flow, managing the balance sheet, managing the DSOs and I would just call it basic blocking and tackling. As you know, in any one quarter the cash flow can fluctuate a little bit and year-over-year through the first six months we are down versus the prior year principally due to the impact of the contract change. But it's something that we're very focused on and we do our best to drive the cash flow in a particular quarter, but not at the expense of the business. So it's really just managing the balance sheet as prudently as we can. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: And any big unusual items that we're of benefit in the quarter, I mean, on timing of? 
Bob Hagemann: Nothing big unusual. The only thing that I pointed out was the big unusual negative which is just up to came through associated with AmeriPath. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Henderson with Jefferies & Company. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Hi, good morning very nice quarter here, a couple of questions for you. Sorry, I know you talked about, thinking about that there are still some competitive challenges ahead. Can you articulate kind of what you are thinking there obviously the pricing environment seems to have stabilized to some extent and your contracts have been renewed? But what's given you concern looking forward competitively? 
Bob Hagemann: Well, first of all we have not completely out of it, although we have 66% signed, but we still have quite a bit of contracts. The thing what really worries me a little bit that the activities last October now created a new water line for this industry. And what we have been doing is reducing our dependency on routine low margin testing and diversifying our revenues and we are moving towards higher esoteric and higher margin of anatomic pathology. And one of the concerns I have is what's going to happen to that sector, but that market is growing and we have now with AmeriPath have created an organization to provide superior service.  So that’s one, the second thing although we don’t like competitive biding, the government is doing this demonstration and that's certainly a concern I have. And there is third thing in our business always is actually the people. How do we really get the right people doing the right business? So execution is the most important thing for us, but as far as the market is concerned we have been in a situation there was a price pressure, it got worse and now we are going to have a new standard, but we have to move on and that's the reason why we have taken our $200 million unrealized cost and by using the Six Sigma and lean principal and technology we are going to reshape the company and take out another $0.50 billion in the next two years and that's going to give us the strength we need to meet the competitive environment and also increase our margin. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay, that's helpful. Bob just a couple of quick questions for you. Obviously we've seen 75% out of the United volume switch over you indicated that there may be a little more in the back half of the year. Where does this stable out in terms of a percentage shift over to other providers? 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah, we have not given specific guidance around a percentage but we do expect that over the course of the year the volume will continue to move the contract that we have provided, because United is putting a lot of effort into making that happen. And all along we have anticipated that that would be case. So we would expect overtime that the United volume will continue to improve. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay and then final question for you Bob, I know you've hit on the $500 million a couple of time's here in this call, but specifically looking in terms of the areas obviously or is this $500 million is more fixed cost, longer-term fixed cost in nature then the short term that you have talked about was the $200 million, is that right? 
Bob Hagemann: Absolutely, it's us fundamentally looking at the way we manage a lot of our processes and making fundamental changes in them so that the costs come out permanently and we're getting at the structural costs in that. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: And is there one big area that you're looking at and is it a hand full of areas? 
Bob Hagemann: As I said we've looked at every single process we have across the Company. And essentially when you think about where our cost are? The costs are coming out reasonably proportionate to where they are; whether it would be in the labs outside the labs, in the administrative functions, etcetera. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay, great and then one last question I'll jump back in the cue on AmeriPath, obviously the margins are a little bit lower than your core Quest business. The areas that you are focusing on right off the back to sort of sure does up a bit or can you sort of identify where those are, is it purchasing or what areas? 
Bob Hagemann: Well, the first thing that we're doing is making sure that the top line continues to grow and that we're not putting any distraction there. That’s the reason that we acquired this company, we believe that there are some tremendous growth opportunities there's and we want to make sure that we will roll on board, we'll try to accelerate the growth for both their business and our business. With that said there are certainly some cost synergies that we've identified in the past that we're going to be going after. I think of those in the areas of purchasing overhead costs, there is some in logistics and then there is bad debt opportunity that I spoke about. But the big benefits from AmeriPath are really going to come from accelerating their growth and our growth as well. 
Art Henderson - Jefferies & Company: Okay great. Congratulations, very nice quarter. 
Surya Mohapatra: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Robert Jones with UBS. You may ask your question. 
Trekkie - UBS: Hi, it's [Trekkie] good morning and congratulations for the quarter. 
Bob Hagemann: Thank you, Trekkie. 
Trekkie - UBS: I have some few questions, some of thought. As far as I think initially earlier in the prepared comments you said that you signed 60% of the managed care contracts that were up for renewal. Could you quantify for us what percent of revenue did this 60% of contracts account for? 
Bob Hagemann: Well, Trekkie the way do I think about is we've said about half or so of our revenues in the clinical testing environment comes through managed care so that to give you some sense and now I would say that a little over 90% of our managed care business is contracted business and a 60% of that number that we've now signed up. 
Trekkie - UBS: Okay, that's helpful. Now to just to clarify on the pricing comments, I think you talked about its update maybe United contract established kind of new order line. Based on the visibility that you have now and with some of the contracts though extended to through 2010, from what you are seeing, are there any step downs in the out here or is it just kind of the initial year that's been or the initial pricing that's now going to seen adjusted to a new level? 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah, Trekkie I really don't want to get into the details of how the pricing works in each of the contracts, I'm not sure of that, that's a good discussion for us to have here. As I said, there continues to be pricing pressure, but we think we came out in a group place for both parties in each of the contracts. And frankly that's one of the reasons that we are instituting this program to pull additional cost out of the business, so that we can continue to expand margins in the pace of that pressure. 
Trekkie - UBS: And just last and you might have said that in the Q&A and I missed it. Is part of the additional $500 million cost and is it related to any AmeriPath synergies? 
Bob Hagemann: Yes. Whatever synergies we get from AmeriPath are included in that number but they are relatively minor piece of that. Again keep in mind that we did that acquisition to accelerate growth not really for cost synergies. 
Trekkie - UBS: Okay. Can you quantify what percent of the 500? 
Bob Hagemann: No. It's the minor pieces I said. 
Trekkie - UBS: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. 
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Well thanks, good morning. Referring the 60% of managed care and the contracts right now. Can you remind us, where we were about six months that same metric? 
Bob Hagemann: I don't have that specific percentage in front of me, but many of those were in discussion at that point. And be frankly that is one of the reasons that we told you that we had a lot less visibility back then than we do now obviously not only in terms of pricing but in terms of access whether or not we'll be participating provider on some of those contracts. 
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: And then are you willing to take shot at say six months from now and where that percentage could shake out and then presumably just wonder in discussion, I should say several of the other payers? 
Bob Hagemann: You know one thing to keep in mind is that there always be a bunch of agreements that are up for renewal about I'd say about 10% to 15% of our contracted managed care business, ex-AmeriPath is under one year agreement. So, we need to deal with those every year sort of on ongoing basis and there is no particular date on which they hold anniversary, I mean, they anniversary at different times during the year. And as you know the HemoCue contract is still out there that we need to work through over the course of this year as well. But at any given point there is typically a fair number of managed care agreements that are out, that have to be negotiated. If you think about, generally on average or contracts or one to three years or so, that means you have got almost 50% of them coming up in any single year. Now given all the ones that we have signed up, we've actually extended that out for a while because now we have got 60% signed up and the majority of those extending into 2010 or beyond. So we have stretched out the cycle a little bit here. 
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: I guess kind of where I was going it certainly sounds like that, that's exactly kind of what you guys have decided to do from a your strategy perceptive is to I presumed to get improved visibility for a longer-term perspective there? 
Bob Hagemann: Absolutely and we know what the boggy is. 
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Fair enough. And then lastly, just with the closing of AmeriPath can you give us update on the acquisition strategy moving forward? 
Surya Mohapatra: Yes, as Bob said and I’ve also indicated that, we have been working almost to over last five or six years to not only have organic growth but have acquired growth and have capabilities that will give us the opportunity to be leader in clinical pathologies, to be leader in gene-based and esoteric testing and AmeriPath has now brought us to a situation where we are the undisputed leader in anatomic pathology and also it gives us an opportunity to change the game by combining the molecular diagnostics and AP.  So in the short-term the growth is in the hospital business, in the short-term the growth is in the anatomic pathology business. But in the long-term also we know as technology is moving so also the testing's are moving near the patient's bed side and that’s the reason why we acquired HemoCue and the recent Focus Diagnostics and quite a number of businesses is going to international.  So with all this key elements in place in the next 18 months, our goal is to integrate and extract the value from all this acquisitions and to have gross leverage. Remember the central piece of our strategy has been diagnostic testing, information and services. It doesn’t really matter whether it’s a pharma company or insurance company or physicians. So we don’t expect any major acquisitions within the next 12 to 18 months. We've got plenty of things to really cleared value. 
Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray: Thanks you guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Robert Willoughby with Banc of America Securities. You may ask your question. 
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Bob a couple of questions, just what are the deleveraging plans over the next 6 to 12 months, will you pursue an accelerated debt reduction program? Or will it be kind of a more measured pace. And then secondarily with the deals announced to-date is supposed to cost cutting in any deleveraging effort. Should we throw out kind of normal seasonality considerations and model sequentially higher earnings kind into 2008? 
Bob Hagemann: Well, let me answer the last first. I think some of the seasonality with respect to the operating margins is affected given the way that the costs are coming out given some of the things that we're doing. But if you look at the guidance and you look at what we're anticipating for the back half of the year. It is not too different in the back half of last year, so what that tells you is we've made a lot of progress in just in our cost structure in trying to re-grow the business replacing the UHC work. And I think it’s a little difficult to give a sense a right now as to what the seasonality looks like, certainly from a top line perspective. It shouldn’t change all that much, but in terms of the margins from quarter-to-quarter, its going to be a little more difficult until we can give you some visibility as to when those additional costs savings are going to flow to the P&L.  In terms of deleveraging, as I mentioned, we did made some commitments to our vendors to get our credit statistics back in line and the way we are going to do that it is by obviously doing some debt repayment, but also improving the operating performance of the business. We know that people are asking a lot about share repurchases and how we are going to use the capital structure, but we think it's important for us to make sure that we have the capital structure in place which is prudent. And what I mean by that is it needs to give us the flexibility to be opportunistic with respect to growth opportunities like we were with AmeriPath. It needs to give us the flexibility to deal with unforeseen situations, which could have a significant impact on operations like we had with UHC. But all that said, we are committed to maintaining the capital structure which is going to maximize shareholder value over the long-term, but we want to be prudent with how we manage it as a public company.  Actually, as a public company, we are probably more leverage than most, when you look at the S&P 500 companies, there are about 85% of the S&P 500 companies which are rated investment grade better and about 70% of those are either add for greater than our ratings right now. So, and actually there is only about 15% that are not in investment grade. So currently, we are more aggressive than most of the S&P 500 with respect to our capital structure, but we still think that it's a reasonable place for our business given where it is right now. And as I said, as we get greater visibility into our projected performance, I think, we can then afford to be more aggressive with how we deploy the cash flows into that capacity of the business. 
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: I guess the last question, Bob with the HemoCue deal and some of the international investments, will the disclosure of all that's well so that we can better gauge the performance of those entities and the returns on those capital investments? 
Bob Hagemann: Since none of those qualify as a separately portable segment but you won't get a lot of additional detail in the public filings. We'll try to give you some sense as to whether or not those businesses are having a significant impact on our operating performance when we report to you. Right now those businesses are relatively small compared to the total so not having significant impact over time. We hope that they would have much greater impact in, we'll start talking more about them. 
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your questions. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Good morning, thank you. Bob, first thing I was just hoping you could just expand a little bit on what you meant by the true-up on the United pricing that positively impact the revenue per acquisition in the quarter? 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah. Tom, the fees schedule that United was using during the first quarter was incorrect and we went to them and pointed that out to them and we corrected that in this quarter. And as I said they had about a half a point impact to the revenue per rep. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: So did you actually get some revenue on some first quarter testing and sort of that true-up, is that what you meant? 
Bob Hagemann: Yeah. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And… 
Bob Hagemann: And it is immaterial to this quarter about 0.5%. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right. 
Bob Hagemann: In terms of revenue per rep. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Right. And then, what about the receivable side of United, I know, at one point you are concerned about collections and now they have used wrong fee schedules, so are you getting the money on a fairly timely basis? 
Bob Hagemann: Yes we are. As I said at the end of the first quarter actually we are getting collections on a very timely basis. United is really no different than any other payer, if you provide them the right information that they need in order to reimburse you, you will be reimbursed timely. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: On AmeriPath, you mentioned before focusing on growth and how to accelerate sort of the combined entities growth. Can you talk about just I guess revenue retentions so far at AmeriPath on two different buckets on specialty business mostly with the hospitals on esoteric side and then the core of AmeriPath pathology related business? 
Bob Hagemann: We have seen no significant loss of business or customers at this point. We feel very good about the retention there, across all of the AmeriPath business. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay good. And then I guess just finally, you have talked a lot about some of the contracts I guess at managed care that you have signed and some that are still out there. One thing that we have been thinking about is just that United clearly is, I mean [Lamprey] is sort of you've invested a lot in some of your core markets with United business in hand. Can you just talk about sort of the competitive landscape at the local level, so not really just for the contract but then once you have the contract, assuming it's not an exclusive one what you are seeing on a day-to-day basis. As the sales guys hit the streets and there is any increased volatility in the business or how the competitive landscape has changed from that perspective? 
Surya Mohapatra: Tom, our competitor has market position in New York, New Jersey area. It's not as if they didn’t have the contract in this area. But because of our value proposition, because of the different suited services we had the major market share and we had the doctors and the patients. And what happened with United and what happened with our competitor, is not only is the contract but this huge amount of transaction costs, gives them the opportunity. So basically forcing the doctors to move and as you know it created an issue probably patients and the doctors in some states say it's illegal.  So what is happening now is as you saw from our activities, the so called discretionary business is not a changing, we lost some but the ratio is improving. We expect that most of the United business is going to go, because it's not only the competitor but also the bill forcing it. But most important thing for us that we did not reduce our service level, our sales people are interested in attaining the business and that gave us the ammunition and also the market position to sign Aetna and CIGNA and other contracts.  So obviously when somebody signed a contract we have so called pull through from other places that is not working. But having said all these things, we are still not out of the woods as far as this comparative process is concern and we will continue improving our service level and we'll continue to get the business based on what we provide and I think that’s we what we are seeing. And going forward obviously it’s a little bit easier now because there are not lot of major contracts left to be used by the same tactics somebody used for United. 
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay, Thank you 
Operator: And Thank you Sandy Draper with Raymond James. You may ask your question. 
Sandy Draper - Raymond James: Thanks. Wanted to may be get a sort of longer term perspective just looking back at the industry back in the 90s last time there was a real significant pricing war primarily driven by SmithKline Beecham. I'm not sure if this is a fair question, but how would you characterize the pricing environment today versus that period back then when we the last time I really saw a significant pricing at least discussed and out there in the open, would you see it better, worse or same or may be contrast to two periods. Thanks? 
Surya Mohapatra: Sandy, it's difficult to really compare exactly the pricing what was 10 years ago, but what I would like to say is that when somebody use price only to get the significant market share especially in medical business, it is not a long-term strategy. And when we look at Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years, now that is we are three players in Quest Diagnostics and SBCL. What together merged and that's created the change and that created the pricing discipline in the industry and as you know SBCL and Quest Diagnostics for us was a game changing event in clinical pathology.  And again that was in '99. In '03 we acquired AML to strengthen the hospital business and that created our hospital business. Now in '07, we are merging with AmeriPath to create another game changing event in anatomic pathology. So, its not only the price that is, we should be worried about its actually what services we provide and how we go forward and I've always said that the diagnostics is the right place to be and if the last 30 years have been the years for pharma and medical devices, the next 30 years is going to be the diagnostics and monitoring for prevention and care, so I think the sector is good, so the disruptions that behind us and I think the payers are working with us and now we want to get along with life and continue providing the best high quality diagnostics services for our patient care. 
Bob Hagemann: Sandy, one other thing that definitely back in the early 90s, the performance of the last companies was really influenced quite a bit by the fact capitation was coming on to the scene whereby the lands were taking utilization, risks and frankly that was one of the big drivers not only what allow to taking risks but it was also become an increased portion of the business. So the mix had shifted to capitation. Since then capitation become a smaller piece of the business. And I would say as the industry in total is a lot smarter about how to price capitative contracts now because we get a lot better information about utilization, demographics et cetera. So that piece of the risk I think is much better managed than it was back then. 
Sandy Draper - Raymond James: Great. That's very helpful commentary. Just two quick follow-ups one on the -- is this is price issue pretty much constrain to your other national competitors or have you seen the smaller or local players trying to match pricing, use price and then, sorry, so its a little bit, is the pricing more focused on just the basic test and obviously a secure quality test some pricing but is it more intense in traditional basic test versus I said character is it more up and down and I'd like to jump back in the queue. Thank you. 
Bob Hagemann: You know Sandy, I think, when you lead with price it's bad for the industry. It doesn't really matter whether it's a large company or small company and I think that was the reason why we said that we could have signed that our contract reserving back for our company and our industry. But we are seeing this price pressure is a new order line for all the players but having said that we have to reorganize and move forward and I am sure all the laboratories whether the small or large have to do the same thing because it is a new game. 
Sandy Draper - Raymond James: Thank you 
Surya Mohapatra: Next question. 
Operator: Thank you. Kemp Dolliver with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. 
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Hi thanks. On the $500 million in cost savings, I guess my question is that if you take your common share regarding the 20% operating margin goal that essentially the net benefit of those savings is essentially that differential between your current margins is the 20%. Is that accurate assumption? 
Bob Hagemann: No, you need to keep in mind that we are going to get to the 20% margins not just by reducing costs. I mean, by growing the top line as well and growing it in the areas that sort of you talked about the higher margin, higher growth pieces of the business. So it's a combination of all of those things and I caution you to take in taking any one of the machine that’s the principal driver of the margin increase. 
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay, just to take that discussion a little bit further than. I guess what underlying cost inflation do you assume you will have that this would $500 million of offset? 
Bob Hagemann: I am not going to get into guessing cost inflation with you and where that’s going. I mean every year we see cost inflation in our business. The biggest piece of our cost or salaries wages and benefits, which accounts for about 50% of our total cost and certainly there is always inflationary pressures. There the other pieces of our business may be a little less so, and as we work with our suppliers obviously we try to manage the impact of that and reduce cost there wherever we can and additionally as we become bigger and we are bigger volume purchaser, that affords us to keep our discounts and in some cases that offsets the impact of inflation. But I don’t want to get into giving you inflationary estimates at this point. 
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: Okay and Bob just in terms of say a percentage reduction in your cost structure. Is it fair to kind of say that’s may be about 8%-9% cost reduction in your cost structure? 
Bob Hagemann: Not too far off. Another way of thinking about it is we generate about $7 billion in annualized revenues now, so it's about 7% of annualized revenues. 
Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company: That's great, Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Thank you, and our final question comes from Bill Bonello with Wachovia 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Hey great, just two follow up questions. One is just the last time that you spoke about AmeriPath, at that point you were pretty confident that AmeriPath would stay as a contracted provider for United Healthcare. And I'm just curious if you have any more color now that it's actually part of Quest? 
Bob Hagemann: Not on a lot of additionally at this point Bill. We think that AmeriPath has a good relationship with UHC, they provide a very valuable service to their members and as we said earlier we expected they will continue to serve UHC members. We really haven’t had any specific dialogue with them about current agreements in place at this point Bill. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Can you just let us know how long the existing contract runs for AmeriPath? 
Bob Hagemann: Their contracts, generally there are few national contracts that they have many of them are regional and local agreements that have varying terms. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Okay and then I guess just a follow-up on maybe what Kemp was striving at a little bit and your comment that at $500 million you would be, all I will tell equally you would be at an operating margin that is, I believe significantly greater than 20%. And so it would seem like given that you think you’re going to have decent revenue growth that should offset inflation. It would seem like there is a pretty hefty expense that you are assuming you're going to have to take on to achieve these cost savings. I’m just wondering if you can give us not necessarily quantifying but give us any color on what kinds of [measures] take on to achieve the $500 million? 
Bob Hagemann: Bill, couple of things, first any cost that we would take on to incur this would be one-time costs. Any costs that will be added to the permanent cost structure already netted in the $500 million. That’s a net change to our cost structure. Now, not all of the opportunities that were going after are going to have a one-time cost to implement either, but for those that do as we approve the detail plans and implement them, we may record charges at that point in time and we’ll call those out and make people well aware them. But when you think about what’s going to drop down to the bottom line, as I said these actions are really to drive us to get to that 20% operating income overtime. Some of the savings is going to get us to the structural cost reductions that we need to make to offset, the loss of the United volume, because remember there was over $400 million in revenue there. So far we pulled out $200 million annualized cost. So, we need to pull out more cost to get back to mitigating that full OEM impact there. Some of the savings is going to be use to offset the pricing pressures were seen, and then obviously we said some is going to be to invest in growth and further differentiate the service offering that we've got. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Okay. And then we have just seen and just help me if my math is wrong when it was seen and given what you just said that erratically if you are successful at this cost savings and you could have operating margins that are in excess of 20%? 
Bob Hagemann: Listen, once we get the 20%, we are not going to stop there or put a governor on it but yeah, we have a long way to go to get to the 20% at this point quite frankly. And this is something that we felt was necessary to get us there. Certainly, when we get there, we are not going to stop but I am not sure that I can give you visibility beyond that at this point. 
Bill Bonello - Wachovia: Okay, we won't model it for the next quarter.
