With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter revenue, earnings and cash flow all came in ahead of our expectations, highlighted by continuing strong momentum in bioprocessing and higher than anticipated respiratory demand at Cepheid. And our team executed well, leveraging the Danaher Business System to accelerate innovation, drive share gains and deliver meaningful productivity improvements. Now as you all know, the macro backdrop has become more dynamic since the start of the year, with rising geopolitical and trade tensions contributing to greater uncertainty across global markets. So before we get into our first quarter results, I'd like to share a few thoughts on how we're approaching this environment. First off, we're navigating this evolving landscape from a position of strength, supported by our talented team and with the Danaher Business System as our driving force. Now it's early and the macro environment remains dynamic, but it's in times like these that Danaher's positioning and capabilities truly stand out. Our businesses are well-positioned in attractive, typically non-discretionary end markets with strong secular growth drivers, united by a common set of more durable business models. In fact, more than 80% of our revenues are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. It's not just the relative durability of our portfolio, it's how we run the business using the Danaher Business System. We're leveraging DBS to proactively manage our supply chains and drive process improvements to help ensure we continue to reliably support our customers each and every day. Now at the same time, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect our financial position, including addressing structural costs, while continuing to invest for the long-term. Now looking into Q2 and beyond, our focus remains clear, delivering for our customers, supporting our associates, and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We've operated through uncertain times before and have come out stronger than we entered. Our team is accustomed to tackling challenges head-on and turning them into opportunities, and we expect that mindset and momentum to continue as we move forward. So with that, let's take a closer look at our first quarter 2025 results. Sales were $5.7 billion in the first quarter and core revenue was flat year-over-year. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were down slightly, with a low-single digit decline in North America and a low-single digit increase in Western Europe. High growth markets were up low-single digits, with solid performance outside of China more than offsetting a high-single digit decline within China. Declines in China were primarily driven by volume-based procurement and reimbursement changes implemented in late 2024, which impacted our diagnostics businesses, while the rest of the portfolio collectively delivered modest growth. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter of 61.2% was up 100 basis points year-over-year and our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.6% was down 50 basis points as the favorable impact of higher volume leverage in our Biotechnology segment and disciplined cost management was more than offset by productivity investments to reduce our structural costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.88. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 110%. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make significant investments in long-term growth initiatives across Danaher. During the first quarter, the investments we've made over the past several years resulted in several impactful new product launches. And these innovations are not only reinforcing our long-term competitive advantages, they're also helping customers improve quality, yields and reduce costs while helping bring new therapies and diagnostic tests to market faster and more effectively. So let me highlight a few of these key launches. In Biotechnology, Cytiva introduced the 500 and 2,000 liter formats of the Xcellerex X-platform bioreactor at the INTERPHEX trade show earlier this month. Now the X-platform is designed to increase cell culture productivity and process intensity, helping drive higher yields while reducing the time and cost of biologic drug manufacturing. With these next-generation technologies, scientists can now seamlessly scale from 50 to 2,000 liters to meet growing demands ranging from clinical trials to commercial production. In Life Sciences, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences added spectral flow cytometry capabilities to the CytoFLEX platform with the launch of the mosaic spectral detection module. The mosaic enables researchers to switch seamlessly between conventional and spectral flow cytometry, while leveraging machine learning assisted data analysis for more precise characterization of multiple parameters simultaneously. Now these capabilities are especially valuable in the fields of oncology, where they facilitate tumor cell profiling and may also help uncover novel therapeutic targets. And in Diagnostics, like a biosystem, leverage the capabilities of our newly established center for enabling precision medicine to launch two new primary antibodies, PD-L1 and HER2, widely used in studying breast, lung and other cancers, with the goal of helping customers accelerate cancer research and therapy development. So now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment increased 7%, with Bioprocessing up high-single digits and Discovery and Medical up low-single digits. In Bioprocessing, we were very encouraged by the better than expected start to the year. Consistent positive momentum in our order book continued into the first quarter, with orders increasing sequentially for the seventh consecutive quarter. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by low double-digit growth in consumables, with particularly robust demand for commercialized therapies. On the equipment front, funnel and order trends are improving, but revenue declined as expected. Now the long-term health of the biologic market is incredibly strong with a growing number of therapies advancing through development and into commercial production. Given the significant growth opportunities ahead, we're investing to help ensure our leading bioprocessing franchise continues supporting customers as they develop and deliver lifesaving therapies to patients. In addition to the new product innovation I mentioned earlier, we've invested approximately $2 billion since 2020 to expand capacity and help ensure supply security for both us and our customers. These additions include new single use technology facilities in South Carolina, filter capacity expansions in Florida and a cell culture media expansion in Utah, all of which are now online, as well as a resins manufacturing plant in Michigan that is nearing completion. Near term, this capacity is critical for supporting existing customer demand, but it's equally important to support Cytiva's robust long-term growth outlook and illustrates our in region, for region manufacturing strategy. Now turning to our Life Sciences segment. Core revenue decreased by 4%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively declined low-single digits. Demand across pharma, clinical and applied markets, which make up the majority of our revenues in these businesses held up well globally, while academic and government demand softened through the quarter, particularly in the United States. In China, demand remained stable sequentially and we were encouraged to see a modest benefit from stimulus programs. Core revenue in our genomics consumables businesses declined in the quarter. We saw continued positive momentum in next-generation sequencing products, but this was more than offset by weaker demand for plasmids and mRNA at two of our larger customers. Now in March, IDT announced a partnership with Elegen, a leader in next-generation DNA manufacturing to offer customers early access to Elegen's ENFINIA Plasmid DNA. This collaboration enables IDT to deliver cost effective, long and high complexity clonal genes alongside its highly differentiated portfolio of custom synthetic biology solutions. With ENFINIA DNA, Life Science and drug discovery researchers can integrate high quality DNA directly into their synthetic biology workflows with minimal or no cloning, saving weeks or even months of development time. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Core revenue declined 1.5%. Core revenue in our clinical diagnostics businesses was essentially flat with mid-single digit growth outside of China. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics had a solid quarter with both instruments and consumables growing mid-single digits outside of China, reflecting strong demand and continued traction in commercial execution. Now during the quarter, Beckman Coulter received a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the DxC 500i integrated chemistry and immunoassay analyzer. The DxC 500i is purpose built to improve efficiency and meet the unique workflow needs for low volume laboratories such as those in community hospitals. This approval strengthens Beckman's position across the healthcare network, enabling it to offer a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for low, mid and high throughput core labs. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's respiratory revenue exceeded our expectations, driven by elevated levels of circulating respiratory illness paired with continued share gains. Strong growth across Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu was led by mid-teens growth in virology. In sexual health, U.S. revenue for our multiplex vaginitis panel was up 40%, as women's health clinicians are increasingly recognizing the value that rapid diagnostics at the point of care brings to patients. Cepheid's healthcare system and integrated delivery network customers continue to increase instrument placements at alternative care sites such as clinics and urgent care centers. So as healthcare decision makers work to most efficiently allocate resources, Cepheid's point of care molecular testing is proving increasingly valuable, offering greater efficiency through fewer total tests, higher rates of correct treatment and ultimately lower treatment costs compared to other testing strategies. So now let's frame how we're thinking about the second quarter and the full year 2025. We expect end market demand remains relatively consistent with the first quarter for the remainder of 2025. Regarding tariffs, based on what is currently implemented, we believe we can largely offset the impact from these tariffs through a combination of supply chain adjustments, surcharges, manufacturing footprint changes and other cost actions. Now for the full year 2025, there is essentially no change to our previous expectations. We continue to expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%, which assumes better performance in our bioprocessing business will be offset by slightly more modest expectations for life sciences. Additionally, we're initiating full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $7.60 to $7.75. Given the current environment, we believe providing adjusted EPS guidance offers the best anchor point for assessing business performance and will provide better clarity for our investors. In the second quarter, we expect core revenue to grow in the low-single digit percent range. And additionally, we expect a second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 25.5%, reflecting normal seasonality in Cepheid's respiratory business and continued productivity investments. So to wrap it up, we're confident in our positioning in what could be choppy waters and we're leveraging the Danaher Business System to ensure we navigate this environment from a position of strength. DBS is what enables us to turn challenges into opportunities, drive meaningful productivity gains and support our customers when it matters most. At the same time, the strength of our balance sheet and financial position allows us to invest for the future, both organically and through strategic capital deployment to further enhance our portfolio and our competitive positioning. Now as we move forward, we believe the combination of our talented team, the differentiation of our portfolio and our strong financial profile will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders in 2025 and beyond. So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. Operator, that concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong start, guys. Rainer, first, I want to start-off on bioprocess. You just had a lot of comments there on the order strength you saw in the quarter. You're raising the full year bioprocess expectation modestly. Just wondering, is that coming more from the consumable side of things? Is it equipment? I think when we spoke on the fourth quarter call, you talked a little bit about how you want to see some of the trends continuing. So could you just talk about what you've seen over the last three months that gives you a little bit more confidence in bioprocess? And if there's any change that you've noticed from customer order behaviors in the last month or two, just given what's going on globally.
Rainer Blair: Sure, Mike. Thank you, and good morning. Look, we had a solid start here to the year and the bioprocessing business is clearly a part of that. And we're really encouraged by the continued positive momentum we saw here in Q1. So to your point around orders, we saw strong orders and revenue performance, which we now expect to be high-single digits core revenue growth for 2025. And those orders grew sequentially now for the seventh consecutive quarter, with the book-to-bill solidly over one. Now consumables continue to lead the way globally. No doubt about that. And we saw low double-digit growth in consumables, which was driven by strong commercial demand at large pharma and CDMO customers and smaller customers were stable, but still below historical levels. Now, as we think about equipment, it's not quite back to normal, but our order and funnels are a little better and I suspect the current environment is probably causing a couple of order delays there. But our commercial programs here on the equipment side and the demand related to them remains healthy. Now, we haven't seen any meaningful change in demand from the current tariff situation or reshoring efforts, but we're really well positioned for that if and when that occurs. So if you put it all together, we're really encouraged by the strong start to the year. And we reaffirm our belief that bioprocessing is a high-single digit grower, both in 2025 and for the long-term.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks. And for my follow-up, I mean, you just touched on tariffs, you spoke about it earlier. In the 10-Q, you called out several hundred million gross impact, but it sounds like you're offsetting most of it. Could you just -- between those various levers, you talked about supply chain, the pricing surcharges, the manufacturing footprint. Any sense you can give us for how you're using those levers, which ones are giving you a little bit more confidence in the ability to offset that? And I think the risk with tariffs is -- right now, we're in a little bit of a holding period. If that comes back or if additional tariffs are implemented, just give us some visibility into your confidence to offset that in this dynamic environment? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Mike, we have a number of levers there and it's important -- but it's important to think about this in the following frame. And including that we have to avoid some false precision here, given some of the assumptions involved. But, the way we sit here today, we think our tariffs could be several $100 million of impact, something like $350 million. But actually we don't think that the current state, so where we sit today is where things ultimately end up. But regardless, we're really well-positioned to largely offset these headwinds. And here are some of the levers that we think about. For instance, we've been executing to regionalize our manufacturing network of over 100 plants for several years now, which allows us to rebalance these trade flows over time. Think China for China, I talked about the billions that we've invested here to increase our U.S. capacity. So we have a combination of both short-term and long-term countermeasures, such as surcharges, supply chain management, again, cost actions, but also relocating manufacturing. And of course, DBS is a real advantage to us here as well as we're focused on this topic. So again, as things change here over time, we've got a number of levers that we can deploy to address the tariff situation.
Matt McGrew: And if -- Mike, if things get worse here or higher or the actions that we find aren't enough, I mean, we can be much more aggressive if we need to be. We've got all those levers to pull. I would say everything is on the table here in that situation, if that's what we get to. So I think we'd be looking at more significant surcharges. I think we've been going after costs even harder and we'd probably be looking at our manufacturing footprint even harder. So everything would be on the table at that point, but we feel like if that's what we're given, that's what we're going to deal with. Then we'll make it work.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to probe a little bit on the last point on tariff offsets, pricing in particular. I think, in the first quarter, obviously, you've got the VBP headwinds on the diagnostics side, but I think Biotech and Life Science pricing was a bit below what we had expected. Can you maybe just talk on your comfort and your ability to take price, areas where you think you can push it more and maybe the mechanism to do it, is this going to be kind of rolling over the course of the year and what is your pricing assumption for the year at this point?
Matt McGrew: I mean, I think from a price perspective, yes, Tycho, like you said, you saw sort of a little bit below where we've been historically, but I'm not sure it's meaningfully below. So I think our price for the year is kind of flattish is the assumption at this point. And that's largely due to the VBP that we've got already baked in. So that kind of brings everything else from a little bit of growth in price down to flat. So, no, that would not include anything to do with surcharges or tariffs, that is sort of not included in that concept of that number. So that would be something in addition to that would be out there. But as you know, a surcharge, really sort of price with no OP associated with it. So I think from a normal perspective of how we think of price, that's kind of where I would put us.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then following up on bioprocess, obviously, equipment has kind of lagged in terms of the recovery. We've seen, I think, $150 billion in new CapEx announced, including Roche today in the U.S. When do you think that becomes a tailwind for you guys? You're obviously in a great position. Is that '26 do you think you start to see some benefit from some of that new build out? Do you think it's '27? What's kind of the time horizon for you guys?
Rainer Blair: Tycho, it's a little bit early to say right now, but generally speaking, where existing plants are being debottlenecked, so additional capacity being added to existing footprint, that will come a little bit quicker here. We're not yet seeing that in our orders. And then, as you think about greenfield investments, that's likely going to take a little bit longer. But as you say, we feel as though we're very well-positioned there to support those expansions right here where they're being built.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just last one, crazy, I have to ask this, given all the moving pieces, anything you can say on kind of the long range outlook in '26, the Street's got you just under 7%. I think that's the big debate for tools is, in general, can this group get back to high-single digit growth? So anything from your perspective, sitting here in April that concerns you for next year?
Rainer Blair: There's nothing that we see in our end markets that makes us think differently about our long-range plans. And as we've talked about before, some of the headwinds that we've talked about for 2025, we believe to be transient. And once we comp those, we expect to be back at those higher growth rates for the long-term plan. So we believe the end markets and how we're dialed into those with our leading franchises, plus getting through some of these head -- one-time headwind leaves us well positioned here for the long-term.
Tycho Peterson: Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Scott Davis: Hey. Good morning, Rainer, Matt, and John.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hey, guys. Can you give us a little bit more color on China? And when I think about the VBP and what it's done to your diagnostics business there, how do you guys think about the algorithm of kind of long-term growth there versus kind of the reality that maybe the pricing environment is never going to make it a very attractive business, but I suppose there's a certain level of scale where maybe it is again, but how do you guys think about China in that context?
Rainer Blair: Well, Scott, I think longer-term, we believe China will be either the second or the largest diagnostic market in the world and we believe we have a real role to play there. The pricing adjustments that you've seen really bring China closer to what global pricing is in other market and continues to be an attractive end market for us. So, as we digest both the reimbursement as well as the volume based procurement topics here in 2025, we look forward to having a strong business development here in China.
Scott Davis: Fair enough. And as for balance sheet optionality, guys, I think you bought back something like $1 billion in the quarter of stock. I think you did something like $6 billion last year. But what -- I mean, the market is re-rated lower. Presumably assets have re-rated lower in the M&A world, although, we -- it's -- we don't have a lot of data points there yet. How do you guys think about the -- that environment, I guess, just overall the balance sheet optionality and what your preferences are here in 2025?
Rainer Blair: Well, Scott, I mean, as you know, our bias is to M&A and our capital allocation, we continue to evaluate all the capital allocation alternatives. They compete against each other for our investments. No doubt that the current environment has pulled in valuations and we're going to have to measure that the degree of uncertainty in relation to those valuations. But one thing is for sure, we're going to stick with our framework, attractive end market, outstanding asset and then of course, the valuation framework has to work as well.
Matt McGrew: And Scott, we've seen this before. Back in the days, you get some shock like this, right? And there's sort of an initial freeze where everybody tries to figure out what's going to happen. And as we sort of work our way through the process of how this is all going to work itself out, that's when I think having the balance sheet that we've got from a position of strength here, we have seen historically that this is a really good time to do M&A once that -- the winds start to blow, if you will. So, I like where we're at. We've got the ability to be aggressive there when stuff does break itself free. Probably just the beginning here, but if we keep going down the path, likely a very good buying opportunity in the future.
Scott Davis: Makes sense. Best of luck, guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Scott.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.
Doug Schenkel: Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to talk about two topics. One is on the genomics segment and one is on earnings guidance. So first on genomics. It seems like Aldevron remains under pressure due to really stocking at one large gene therapy and one large mRNA customer. I just want to make sure this is a continuation of trend and not really anything new in terms of a further deterioration relative to recent quarters. I don't think there's anything new there, but just want to make sure. And you kind of building off of that, when do you move past that dynamic? So that's the first topic. The second is on earnings. You gave us top line guidance. You gave us a lot of detail below the operating line. I don't think you gave us full year operating margin targets, but I think mathematically, it looks like you're maintaining that 28.5% target that you talked about coming off of the Q4 call. If that's right, I'm just wondering kind of where the offsets are built into the P&L, especially given that in Q1, you came in, I think about 300 basis points ahead of operating margin target. So I just want to see what the offsets are? And is that a function of prudent conservatism, given the environment we're in or is there something else we should be contemplating? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. No, I think you're right, Doug. On the margin side, the part of the reason that we gave an EPS guidance, we just felt like in this environment, there was -- there are going to be moving pieces in your P&L depending on sort of how you tackle these tariffs, some surcharges, cost out, etc. So I just think we felt like an adjusted EPS guide was a place for us to anchor and make sure that as things move in the P&L as they play out during the year, there was a point of anchor, which is so why we sort of did the EPS guide for everybody. As far as what that margin translates to, you're about right with the 20.5% (ph) that you talked about. So I don't think that that's different. As far as offsets, I think if you sort of -- I think what you're kind of getting at is, look, we had a $0.25 beat here in Q1 and probably have some FX tailwinds. And we've got a little bit of cost out tailwind behind us too, and you start to add those up, you probably can get to a number that's above that range. And I think that's -- I think your math is correct there. But we do have some cushion in this environment that probably, I think Rainer and I believe that strikes the right balance given the uncertainty in the macro today. A lot of positives to start the year here. We told you guys we're going to get after that cost structure. We're making really good progress on that, got after the first quarter, gives us a head start as we head into the year. But in this current world we are in, I think it makes sense for us to frame the guide of $7.60 to $7.75. We've got some cushion there, obviously, to the degree things sort of get worse. And if they don't and we see there's probably further upside. I think you're right, if things don't get any worse from here. So let's see how things progress. Lots to do on the policy front to get us to some resolution, but that's sort of our full stop philosophy on how we're thinking about this guide.
Rainer Blair: Doug, and as it relates to Aldevron, as you suggest, there's really nothing new there. We anticipated this to occur and we see those two customers progressing as we thought and we expect that to get better here to your question in the second half of the year as we comp through it.
Doug Schenkel: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, Rainer. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, (ph) Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: My first question on the tariff math here. The $350 million of that gross headwinds, is that a full year impact or a partial year impact? And maybe if you could parse out, is this majority of this coming from China? What is being assumed for ex-China? And is tariff the primary reason why second quarter margins are trending down Q-on-Q?
Matt McGrew: Let me start with the last one, 2Q trend down that has nothing to do with tariffs. So the Q2 sequential trend down has everything to do with lower respiratory volume at Cepheid. We've got an assumption of Q2 revenue for respiratory of about $250 million, down from $625 million. Very similar dynamic to what we saw last year when respiratory had that same big step down. So it's -- unfortunately, that is just part of our seasonality now, if you do get a good start to the respiratory season in Q1. Also in Q2, there is some restructuring. As we talked about, we are getting after some of the cost structure, in particular in Diagnostics, which is probably where it will show up the most. Given the VBP headwinds there and some of the things that they're doing to globally re-center, if you will, some of their go-to-market exercises, that is where we're seeing the biggest piece. So that's sort of Q2. As far as I think about the $350 million, that is a rest of year tariffs in place now number. So that is -- that's just kind of what we expect for here in '25. As far as what we might see in '26 for a full year, I wouldn't take that and multiply it by two. We're a long way away from December or January of '26 or December of '25. So I think very difficult to kind of to just double that number and assume that's what it's going to be. We're going to need to get a little bit more information before we can validate that for next year. And then, sort of where is that exposure coming from was your other question. I think the easiest -- the frame that we sort of have is, it's kind of 50% of it is coming from -- of our headwind, if you will, is coming from U.S. to China. And most of that is diagnostics, where we sell into -- from an assay perspective. The other half of that exposure is mostly U.S. from Europe. So that's -- I mean, there's some others, obviously with the 10% global, but the easiest way to think about it is half is U.S. to China, the other half is U.S. from Europe.
Vijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Matt. Rainer, maybe one for you on the Biopharma. There is some of the pharma customers talking about potential R&D cuts if they face some tariffs. What is Danaher's total exposure to pharma, pharma overall, including bioprocessing? And how much of that is a pure production or manufacturing, which shouldn't be impacted even if R&D goes down? Maybe some commentary on R&D versus production.
Rainer Blair: As you think about Life Science R&D for pharma, that is really represented in our -- primarily in our instruments group there, and it probably represents a third of that. So this is relatively small exposure. Keep in mind, our Life Science instruments, so the research tools exposure overall for Danaher is less than 10% of sales. And then once again, now we're talking about a third of that. Also, if you think about our performance here in Q1, we actually saw that pharma segment be fairly robust here and we haven't seen yet any additional deterioration as it relates to that particular segment. So, pharma, we see steady and investing, independent of what one pharma company does versus another. But overall, we see the segment as fairly robust here from a research perspective. And we continue to see bioprocessing. As I mentioned, we took up the guide here. We're really encouraged by what we see there.
Matt McGrew: And as far as, Vijay, it's kind of the exposure wise, I mean, maybe the easiest way to think about it is, bioprocessing is $6 billion of revenue and that's probably the one that you're most worried about given the size of how big that is versus anything else we might have in Life Sciences or elsewhere. And that's all essentially commercial, right? It's 75% of that is going to be on-market or Phase III. So I think that's kind of the frame of how I think about our pharma exposure.
Scott Davis: That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Good morning, you guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the Life Sciences' performance. So you took down your assumptions for the Life Sciences guidance to now be flat for the year versus the prior assumption of low-single digit growth. You also called out some of the weakness in U.S. academics and government. So I was wondering if you could unpack that for us a bit. What types of products are you seeing the most weakness in in that research market? And then specifically regarding U.S. academics and government, how much was it down in the quarter? And what are you assuming for the full-year for US academic and government, especially in light of the reports last week that the new administration is going to be proposing a 40% cut to NIH?
Rainer Blair: So to start with, good morning, Rachel. And just a reminder, as I just mentioned to Vijay, we're talking Life Science tools here, which are less than 10% of our revenue. So keep that in mind as you read across. For Q1, our Life Sciences finished modestly better than anticipated. And the reasons are that the comps are beginning to ease. And to your point, outside of U.S. government and academic segment, the market conditions are stable and why is that? Because we've dialed our portfolio into what we believe are the more attractive market segments here. For the long term, pharma, clinical and applied are by far how we've positioned our business. Now again, to your point, academic and government demand did soften through the quarter, that's particularly a U.S. phenomenon. Other geographies were a little more stable there. So, as we think about the guide here in 2025, we have taken account of the fact that we expect the U.S. government and academic market to continue to soften with the noise that we're hearing. And that is basically offset by the strength that we're seeing in bioprocessing. The kinds of instruments and the kinds of products that we're talking about here are the instruments that you're familiar with in research, but also then some of the laboratory consumables and reagents that you would use in that research with some of these government – U.S. government-funded labs.
Matt McGrew: Rachel, may I just add a word on that academic. I mean, this is not a huge number for us, obviously. I think you -- for Q1, it was kind of down mid-single digit type range, just to give you some sense of it. Now orders were getting worse than that. So I think that's the read-through, if you will, to why we've taken a bit more cautious stance. But again, this is a pretty small number for us.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Yeah. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: I mean, Direct NIH is -- Yeah. Direct NIH, Rachel, is less than a percent of our revenue and government and academic globally is low-single digits.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Yeah. Thanks for that color. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the earlier answers regarding bioprocessing. So you mentioned that book-to-bill was comfortably above one this quarter and that orders grew sequentially for the seventh quarter in a row. So, digging into that a little bit more. Last quarter you noted that bioprocessing orders grew high-single digits sequentially. So did you see orders grow high-single digits again this quarter sequentially or was order growth slightly less, given that standard seasonality that you typically see? And then on a go-forward basis, should we expect that bioprocessing orders continue to step up throughout the year or we kind of reset back to this normal order seasonality at this point? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. Maybe I'll say a word on orders and the expectations. We've got -- we guide to revenue here. So from an order perspective, we're not going to kind of have an order guide and a revenue guide. But like we said, we think it's going to be high-single digit from a growth perspective and the orders obviously will support that. So as far as this quarter, it was sort of in that range. From a sequential perspective, I think the really good news from my chair here is that a book-to-bill that was, as we said, solidly over one is encouraging. That is a good first step here to support the rest of the year.
Operator: Great. Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Daniel Brennan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just on the Life Science guide, I know you gave some color earlier on Aldevron, but Q2 guide down low single. I think mid-single is a little bit below us. And then the full year guide would imply a nice step-up in the back half of the year. So just can you walk through some of the visibility and drivers of the step-up in the back half of the year?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. I mean, from a number perspective, as I think about it, I mean, I think about the seasonality, both for Life Sciences, but just generally speaking for Danaher, I look at the seasonality last year and from a revenue perspective, it was kind of first half was 48% and the second half was something like 52%. So it's pretty similar here in what we're assuming on a revenue perspective in '25 at the Danaher level. So I think that's kind of the way I look at it. There's some puts and takes, I'm sure within the segments, but just in total, feel like we're kind of in the same zone that we were here last year. And it kind of has been that way historically, frankly, if we go way back, but those are different times.
Daniel Brennan: Got it. Thanks, Matt. And then maybe just on China. I know you talked about I think ex-VBP things looked pretty good. Could you just unpack it a little bit how we're thinking about the rest of the year? We get a lot of questions on just the tit for tat here with the tariffs and kind of what China is doing, maybe to take a more sharper view against kind of Western vendors. So just if you can unpack a little bit how to think about the rest of the year and then kind of any activity from the government in -- kind of reaction to the tariff wars? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: So we're seeing a fair amount of stability other than this volume based procurement and reimbursement issue for diagnostics and patient volumes. So patient volumes continue to be strong. We don't see China looking to move Western suppliers out of their supply chain. Certainly, like all customers around the world, customers are looking for supply chain security. They want to make sure they're going to be supplied. And as we think about bioprocessing, that continues to be stable as they've reached the bottom there and we're starting to see a little bit of life. And we talked about Life Sciences. Life Sciences is stable on the back of a little more stimulus than we've seen in the past, making up for some of the demand contraction that we had seen. So, generally speaking, we expect this to be stable. We're prepared with our supply chain to supply China. The majority of our supply is either China, for China or coming from non-U.S. plants. We've been working on that for years. And so, we'll continue to see what happens here on the policy front, but for now, we see China as stable and as anticipated. So we don't expect that to change that full year guide today.
Daniel Brennan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Participant: This is Sam (ph) on for Luke. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you talk a little bit more about VBP headwinds this quarter? Any pull forward there or did that come in line with the expectation of it being like a $50 million headwind? And is the cadence of VBP still intact from what you stated last quarter, which was kind of the $50 million, $50 million, $30 million, then $15 million to $20 million framework?
Matt McGrew: I think so, yeah. I wouldn't change off of that, come off of that. And VBP was very much in line with what we thought here in Q1. So I would not say, we have seen any change to what we thought would be our impact here from VBP.
Unidentified Participant: Got you. And then just sticking to China, could you talk about the magnitude of the China stimulus as a tailwind for you guys this quarter? And then kind of what the expectations are for the rest of the year as you see it right now?
Rainer Blair: I would call the stimulus measured. We saw that in the Life Science instruments primarily, that was with some government agencies, more specifically in food testing and we also see some of the Tier 2 universities starting to get their arms around that funding mechanism. So we also saw that as well. But I would call that measured -- a measured level of stimulus that is essentially making up for some of the demand contraction that we saw earlier.
Unidentified Participant: Thanks for that. Appreciate it.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Luke.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.
Daniel Arias: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Matt, the $7.60 to $7.75 EPS guide, does that assume the full $150 million of cost savings is captured this year? And then now that you're out of the gate, I think you said, should we just assume that the remainder of that gets layered fairly evenly across the next three quarters or is there a skew from a timing perspective there?
Matt McGrew: No, I think the cadence is right. It kind of -- I think it will layer in fairly evenly. Might get a little bit more here in Q3 than Q4, but I'd have to -- but I would just put it for modeling, I'd do it evenly. I mean, maybe the way to think about the $150 million that we've talked about, we've incorporated into the guide what we've achieved so far. And so, of the $150 million, we think we got about $50 million in Q1 and that is incorporated in the guide. The other sort of $100 million is what might -- I might call cushion to see like I kind of talked to when -- I think Doug asked the question earlier around what the -- walking through the math to something that might be potentially a higher number, I would put that as part of that cushion that exists for what might go bump in the rest of the year.
Daniel Arias: Okay. Is there any reason why you wouldn't capture that? I mean, it seems pretty, to hear you talk about, it seems pretty straightforward. So, is it just really well, we'll factor it in when we actually capture it or is there something that needs to develop in order to feel confident about that happening?
Matt McGrew: No. I mean, I think we'll be able to capture it. I think it was more the general view of how we sort of outlined how we're thinking about the rest of the year in the current environment and wanting to sort of see how things play-out, especially from a policy perspective before we get too constructive, but we feel like we're in a pretty good spot here if things do go out to be able to talk about higher numbers if things do improve. But we're taking a little bit of a conservative approach, given we are 20 days into a new environment.
Daniel Arias: Yeah. Sure. Okay. Thanks a bunch.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn it back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We'll be around the rest of the day and week for follow-up questions. Good day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's program and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Madison, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us on the call today. So we finished the year strong with better-than-anticipated core revenue in all three of our segments and we were particularly encouraged by another quarter of positive momentum in our bioprocessing business and the improving performance in our Life Sciences instruments businesses. Our team's disciplined execution also drove solid cash flow and operating profit margin expansion. Now throughout 2024, our 63,000 associates demonstrated an unwavering commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System, which enabled us to successfully navigate a dynamic operating environment. Now their dedication not only drove meaningful process improvements across our businesses, it also delivered impactful innovations for our customers, both of which are positioning Danaher for sustainable long-term success. Now, looking to 2025 and beyond, we believe Danaher is better positioned than at any point in our 40-year history. The transformation in our portfolio since the beginning of the pandemic has shaped us into a focused life sciences and Diagnostics innovator with a re-rated long-term growth, margin, and cash flow profile. Our differentiated science and technology portfolio paired with the power of DBS and our talented team positions us well to create long-term shareholder value, while making a meaningful positive impact on human health. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full-year 2024 financial results. Sales were $23.9 billion and core revenue declined 1.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 28.6% was essentially flat year-over-year and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.48. We also generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 135%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher and 2024 marks the 33rd consecutive year of free cash flow to net income conversion which exceeded 100% and speaks to the differentiated quality of our earnings and business models. Now through 2024 and into the start of 2025, we deployed approximately $7 billion of capital towards the repurchase of 28 million shares of Danaher common stock. This includes approximately 20 million shares purchased in the second and third quarters and approximately 8 million shares purchased in the fourth quarter and into January 2025. We also remained active on the M&A front, completing several strategic acquisitions during the year. Now these acquisitions bring innovative technologies and solutions that further strengthen our competitive advantages and position us for sustained long-term success. Now we also continued to make substantial investments in innovation throughout the year, enabling the launch of several groundbreaking technologies that are advancing our customers' critical work. In Biotechnology, Cytiva introduced the Sefia cell therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR-T cell therapy manufacturing. The efficiencies customers gained through the Sefia platform have the potential to increase patient access to these life-saving therapies. In Life Sciences, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences introduced the Cydem VT Automated Cell Culture System, which simplifies and accelerates the cell line development process, enabling pharmaceutical researchers to bring therapies to market faster. And in Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics made significant strides in expanding the cardiac and blood virus menus on the DxI 9000, our next-generation high-resolution immunoassay analyzer. With sensitivity 100 times greater than traditional immunoassay systems, the DxI 9000 is enabling faster and more accurate patient diagnoses and ultimately paving the way for precision diagnostics. These are just a few examples of how our innovation engine is driving long-term growth and helping customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. So now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2024 results in more detail. Sales were $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter and we delivered 1% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were essentially flat with a low-single-digit decline in North America and a low-single-digit increase in Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits with solid performance outside of China, more than offsetting a mid-single-digit decline in China. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 59.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.6% was up 90 basis points, driven primarily by the positive impact of cost savings initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.14 were up 2.4% year-over-year and we generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. So now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment increased high-single-digits year-over-year, with our bioprocessing business up high-single-digits and our discovery and medical business is up low-double-digits. In bioprocessing, the gradual recovery we saw through the year continued into the fourth quarter. We were particularly encouraged by the sustained positive momentum in our order book, which grew high-single-digits sequentially and this represents the sixth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit sequential order growth. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by consumables, supported by robust demand for commercialized therapies. Equipment demand, while improved remained subdued as customers continue to be cautious with their capital spending. Now in China, underlying activity levels were relatively stable, but weak as customers faced ongoing challenges in a difficult funding environment. But the continued progress we're making in our business, coupled with healthy underlying market trends reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook for Cytiva's bioprocessing franchise. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise more than 75% of our bioprocessing revenues remain the largest investment area for our customers and 2024 was a near-record year of FDA approvals for new monoclonal antibodies. At the same time, biosimilar development and production are increasing as patents on high-volume therapies expire, making life-saving treatments more accessible and driving broader adoption. With our comprehensive portfolio and an innovation engine focused on increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we're very well-positioned to support our customers today and for the long term. Now turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue increased by 1%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences instrument business was up slightly, exceeding our expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we saw modest demand improvements at our pharma and applied customers. In China, while we did see a modest benefit from the ongoing stimulus program, market conditions continue to be challenging as customers remain cautious with their investments. In October, Leica Microsystems expanded its STELLARIS Confocal Microscope Platform with the introduction of SpectraPlex, a cutting-edge solution for 3D imaging in spatial biology. SpectraPlex, enables researchers to gain deeper insights into cellular organization, interactions and spatial phenotyping, advancing the understanding of disease progression and aiding in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Now core revenue in our genomics consumables business declined in the quarter. Growth across next-generation sequencing products and basic research was more than offset by declines in proteins, plasmids, and gene writing and editing solutions. Moving to our Diagnostics segment, core revenue decreased 2%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered low-single-digit core revenue growth, like Biosystems led the way with nearly 10% growth driven by strength across core histology, advanced staining, and digital pathology. Notably, Leica placed a record number of its GT450 digital pathology slide scanners this quarter, as clinicians are increasingly looking to leverage its predictive algorithms and productivity gains to deliver more accurate and timely patient diagnoses. To further enhance the digital pathology capabilities, Leica recently established a strategic partnership with Indica Labs, a global leader in AI-powered digital pathology software. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer diagnostics by combining Leica Biosystems expertise in instrumentation and extensive global footprint with Indica Labs' leadership in enterprise, software, and artificial intelligence. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was essentially flat with mid-single-digit core revenue growth outside of China, offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China. Earlier this month, Beckman introduced several cutting-edge research use-only assays for neurodegenerative disease research on the DxI 9000. Now these assays allow researchers to detect and quantify emerging neurodegenerative biomarkers with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, providing valuable insights into conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted breakthrough device designation to Beckman's p-tau217, beta-Amyloid 1-42 assay designed to aid clinicians in identifying patients with Alzheimer's. This designation reflects the potential of Beckman's test to transform how clinicians diagnose and manage Alzheimer's, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for patients and families affected by this devastating disease. In molecular diagnostics, increasing menu adoption and system utilization contributed to another quarter of mid-teens core revenue growth in Cepheid's core non-respiratory reagent portfolio. All of these product lines delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, led by over 20% growth in sexual health as customers are increasingly adopting our Multiplex Vaginitis Panel or MVP. The rapid growth of the MVP panel since its introduction highlights the value, rapid turnaround diagnostics brings to women's health clinicians at the point of care. Cepheid's Multiplex Panel enables physicians to quickly and accurately diagnose infections and prescribe targeted treatments, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now beyond enabling improved clinical outcomes, MVP underscores the significant growth opportunities ahead as we continue to expand our women's health business and is also a great example of how Cepheid is unlocking long-term growth opportunities in outpatient settings. Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million as we saw both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. In 2024, Cepheid's installed base grew by high-single-digits and is now more than 60,000 instruments globally. In recent quarters, we've seen healthcare systems and integrated delivery network customers accelerating the placement of new instruments at alternate care sites such as clinics and urgent care centers. This expansion beyond the hospital helps customers improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by standardizing care across their networks. With the continued expansion of our leading global installed base, the largest test menu on the market and a robust innovation pipeline, Cepheid is well-positioned for sustained long-term growth. Now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the first quarter and the full year 2025. For the full year 2025, we anticipate core revenue growth of approximately 3%. In addition, we expect an approximately 2% revenue headwind due to recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We also expect a full-year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28.5%. In the first quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low-single-digit percentage range. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26.5%. So to wrap up, we are pleased with our fourth-quarter performance and look forward to building on this momentum as we move into 2025. Our team successfully executed through a dynamic environment to deliver strong financial results, while continuing to invest for the future. Looking ahead, the transformation in our portfolio paired with our organic growth investments has created a lineup of outstanding franchises that are very well-positioned in highly attractive end markets. And we're a better, stronger company today positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins and stronger cash flow with tremendous opportunities to continue building upon this foundation. With the powerful combination of our leading portfolio, talented team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, we feel well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.
Matt McGrew: Good morning.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Good morning. Wanted to start by digging more into the guide for Life Sciences in 2025, that's where I'm getting most of the questions, notably the pacing. So starting down mid-singles, getting to low-single digits up for the year. As you look at the operating businesses there, can you just call out, is there anything that stands out as one-off, or notable in terms of the ramp? I mean, just when in the year will you return to growth? Is 2Q reasonable or is it more back-half weighted?
Rainer Blair: So, Jack, good morning, and thanks for the question. For 2025 in Life Sciences, it's the one segment where we see a little bit of noise right now with the external environment. But given that, we're trying to take a reasonably prudent approach to the guide for 2025 and we're assuming Life Science tools up for - up low-single digits and Pall and Genomics will be down. So we'll possibly do better, but where we sit today, this is probably a good starting point. As we think about the phasing, we would expect each quarter to get a little better.
Matt McGrew: Okay. Jack, maybe - just Q1, like you said, it's kind of down mid-single digits. I think we probably are kind of flattish as we head into Q2, and then kind of ramp up from there. And really Q1, the big kind of comp issue is a lot of it really is Pall, in particular, some of the things in the industrial business, both year-over-year with some big projects that we saw there and then also sequentially kind of the step-down. If you will, from Q4 in Life Sciences, they were a double-digit grower here in Q4. I think they're going to be negative here in Q1. And given the size of that business, it's almost $2 billion. It does kind of move the needle. But the core tools we think is still in pretty good shape and kind of at the high end of low-single digits.
Jack Meehan: Great. Okay. And then, Rainer, you alluded to this a little bit. Obviously, had the change in administration, and U.S. academic government funding has been a hot topic, a lot of headlines. I was curious if you could give us a state-of-the-state, what you're seeing in the market today and how, did that influence the way that you set the guide?
Rainer Blair: So, well, it's only been a couple weeks here of the new administration, Jack, but in general, we'd expect the environment to be more business-friendly. And certainly, the election has not changed our view of our portfolio, which we know is positioned towards the most attractive secular growth trends in Life Sciences and Diagnostics. And sure, and we plan for this. And as you said, we've talked about that here in the Life Science guide for 2025. There's likely going to be some puts and takes, but we - we're confident we can leverage our portfolio and the Danaher Business System to continue to outperform.
Matt McGrew: But Jack, I do think it's fair to call out that this is the one segment in Life Sciences where the noise around - like Rainer said, the noise around it is higher, because I think that's where we've seen most of the noise has been around that segment. So I think we're trying to take some of that noise into account. I think mostly it's going to be in Life Sciences, is where you see that. And I think it probably - it's probably fair to say that we took a fairly prudent approach, to how we thought about starting the year here, given some of the - kind of given some of the recent news.
Jack Meehan: That all makes sense. Thank you, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Jack.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on what you called out for the Diagnostics segment. I think there's a little bit of a shortfall there versus expectations in the guide. You called out specifically Cepheid respiratory, you're looking for $1.7 billion versus I think $1.95 billion in fiscal year '24. And then for volume-based procurement in China, you talked about $150 million for the year, versus previously you were expecting sort of a steady cadence of $50 per year. So just talk - can you just talk through those both pretty quickly? One is, what changed in the VBP? Sound like it changed a little bit in the fourth quarter, as well and just how you think VBP headwinds come through in 2025 and '26? And then for Cepheid respiratory, why is $1.7 billion the right number? I mean, we've talked about this for a while. It's sort of like, at what point do you say, okay, this is the new endemic. So you did $1.95 billion in 2024. Why isn't that just the new normal going forward where we're four years post-COVID, it feels like respiratory sort of like settled down a little bit. So what are you seeing in January that's making you revise that?
Matt McGrew: Yes. Mike, let me see if I can capture all that. So first, VBP 150 versus the 50 that we thought before, that is correct. I think we think now and we saw 50 here in '20 in Q4. So probably 200 all-up, but 200 in two years instead of the three that we thought. So I think that's right. As far as why did, that and how did it accelerated in Q4, I mean, we just saw in Q4 a lot more aggressive stance in China. Particularly from the central government, to sort of really get after VBP and do some other things outside of just straight VBP, also going and doing some reimbursement cuts. And so, I think the combination of the tenders that we saw come through, the reimbursement cuts really accelerated here late in the quarter, frankly. This was kind of a November, almost in December phenomenon. So that kind of came through and informed our guide, as we think about going forward. From a respiratory perspective, you're right, we are here $1.7 billion. We've always thought that was about the normal range for a normal respiratory season in an endemic state. In the last two years, we did about $2 billion. And I think what we saw in the last couple years was we sort of had a bit of a double-dip, if you will. We had a big spike in September, October as people sort of return to school, and then return to work, return to school. And then we saw another one here, usually a typical respiratory season in January and February. And we didn't really see that this year. And so that was we're kind of assuming that we're going to go back to that normal respiratory pattern, where we see a bit of a spike up in the ILI, like we are seeing now. Did not see it as much here in Q3 like we normally do. And so, I feel pretty comfortable that $1.7 billion is the endemic rate. We did a little bit better the last couple of years. But that's no real different than, what it was like prior to COVID. We had respiratory season. Some are better than others, not better, but from a testing perspective, more testing versus not. So I feel pretty comfortable with the $1.7 billion still versus $2 billion being some sort of new number. I just - maybe we're proven wrong, but given what we've seen in the data, I think $1.7 billion is - it's probably going to be a pretty regular - pretty normal respiratory season.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up on bioprocess and biotechnology, you talked about 6% to 7% for the year in biotechnology, same thing for the first quarter. So it seems like sort of pretty steady throughout the year. I think we talked about bioprocess being maybe more of a high single-digit business, so thinking more of like an 8%, maybe 7% to 8%. Is the delta there really just the instrumentation part of it? Sort of if it wasn't for that, would you be at that 8% rate for the year? And if so, if it is instrumentation, just any signs of that, any hope of that coming back as you go through the year, just sort of like what's holding that back? Why is that still so subdued if the consumables are really back and the demand continues to be there?
Rainer Blair: I'll tell you, we were very encouraged by what we're seeing in the bioprocessing business and the orders growth, six consecutive orders now of high single-digit orders growth. We don't normally talk about the year-over-year numbers, but even in the fourth quarter, well over 30% orders growth there, and probably one of the biggest quarters that we've had in two years in terms of orders growth. So we think the bioprocessing sets up very nicely. Now to your point, look, we expect 6% to 7% core growth in 2025. That's essentially similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. And what we're seeing in consumables, are essentially also back to normal here with large customers driving that. And we do see some improvement there with smaller customers as well, but they're still not back to normal, so to your question. And then as it relates to equipment, it's also better, but not quite back to normal. So we continue to be really encouraged, by what we're seeing and the recovery is clearly underway.
Michael Ryskin: All right. Thank you.
Operator:
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: So I'm going to go into a completely different direction, because guidance we can kind of fixate on for the rest of the call. I'm sure lots of people will. It was maybe a little disappointing. But I wanted to get a sense from you guys just in talking about seeing some of the build-out of test capability in Cepheid. What does AI do for you guys at - it could be broader than just Cepheid, but when you think about ability to kind of lever that computing power into something that maybe materially, or meaningfully increases your ability to broaden out those test kits, and really make them more ubiquitous? How do you guys think about that?
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks for the question, Scott. We're well into the application of Artificial Intelligence throughout the corporation here and to your question, also in research and development. And essentially, how we're applying it is to accelerate the development time, not only of our assays, so certainly the technical and research aspect of R&D, but also in terms of how we get. The integrated evidence plan that you need, to get that assay to-market much more quickly and broadly on-top of, of course, the decision support systems that we're building. Another example is like a Biosystems where you just saw us do a deal with Indica Biolabs, where clearly the journey takes us to digital diagnostics in pathology that is supported by artificial intelligence. Helping those pathologists to make not only faster diagnoses, but to see things that they might not normally see. So we are definitely down the path here, and investing significantly in accelerating cycle times throughout the corporation, but certainly in R&D as well.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And guys, just as a completely different follow-up, but where does Abcam and Aldevron, however, you pronounce it,, where do they sit versus the deal model when you guys close those deals? Are we still ahead of the deal model on those? It sounds like we may have taken a little bit of a step backwards, but maybe I misheard that?
Rainer Blair: No, I think on Abcam, we're still pretty close. That's still pretty new, Scott, that's only about a year-old. So I think we're pretty much tracking close there, Aldevron we're behind. I don't think there's any way to say it other than that. And largely, it has to do with the end-markets of genomics are proving to take a little bit longer sort of, to round themselves out. And but ultimately, while behind on the deal model, it's disappointing working hard to make sure that we try and close that gap. But it's still a business that we are going to want to own. We need to be in genomics, we're going to be in genomics. If you're in life sciences, you have to have that presence. We feel as though that business is a fantastic business with really well-positioned to take advantage of the genomics market. When it does sort of ramp beyond the current levels, and I think it will. So for the long-term, I think it's the right business to own for sure. But we're working hard to kind of catch back up on the deal model, but I would say that we are behind, yes.
Scott Davis: Okay. Thank you for the integrity of that answer. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Daniel Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just starting on Bioprocess for a moment, just back to Mike's question. You talked about really strong order growth in the fourth-quarter. I think you had the same thing really in the third quarter, so call it, probably maybe north of 30 or north of 20. Can you just remind us, Rainer, of the linkage between orders and the forward growth for your Bioprocess business? And is our thinking that such strong second half order growth shouldn't portend for potentially much stronger growth in '25 for revenues?
Rainer Blair: Well, I mean, it certainly sets us up well. Some of our customers get their orders in very early and it has implications for the second half of 2025, and others do that with the shorter lead times that we're able to deliver on for the first half. So again, as we think about our orders development, of course, that is what is in our guide and supports our guide for the year. And we really like where we're positioned here, both competitively, but also we are seeing the recovery here clearly underway, essentially in all segments.
Daniel Brennan: Okay. Got it. Okay. And then maybe just kind of a big picture question. The next five years, I know pharma patent expirations are set to grow versus the prior five. I think '28 is a particularly big year. And in your prepared remarks, you talked about the benefit of biosimilars to your bioproduction business. Just how do we think about the impact of Danaher's kind of your overall growth from these patent expirations? Are these - are these going to be more of a tailwind, or a headwind if you want to think about maybe separating between bioprocess and more R&D related areas? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Yes. Well, as we think about bioprocessing, that business is driven by volume. And it's really critical to understand that the more volume there is, the more we benefit and drive growth both top and bottom. And we're so well-positioned there. We've talked about the number of monoclonal antibodies being approved, and you can expect that we are participating in all of those. And that momentum of monoclonal antibodies going forward, which represents 75% of the business is really what drives the train. So as you think about these biosimilars, starting to penetrate other patient groups that heretofore have not been able to candidly afford to buy these kind of therapies, or even payers have been unable to pay for those kinds of therapies, that's a tailwind for us. And so, biosimilars is an important category to understand. What's interesting about biosimilars, once again, in biologics, the end product cannot be perfectly characterized. So the regulators tend to lock down the process to ensure consistency there. And so, even biosimilar manufacturers, will try to use the inputs that have been previously approved by those regulators, to ensure speed to market and a minimum of delay to getting to patients. So biosimilars, higher volumes tailwind for Danaher.
Daniel Brennan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Schenkel: Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions.
Rainer Blair: Good morning.
Douglas Schenkel: So I want to start on diagnostics and then kind of pivot over to a philosophical question. So first on diagnostics. If I'm doing the math right on the respiratory headwind and the VBP incremental headwinds, I think this implies kind of what's embedded into your guidance, is an implied 5% core and normalized diagnostic growth rate. Is that right? And if not, why isn't this a little bit higher? And then when would we see evidence, of you getting back to that high-single-digit growth rate that, I believe you're still targeting? So that's the diagnostic topic. The second one, which I'll just get out of the way is the guidance philosophy question. So if you go back and look at how 2025 EPS expectations have progressed over time, if you go back to the beginning of 2023, the street was at 1,120. At the beginning of last year, the street was at around 880. Yesterday estimates were at 809. And if I'm doing the math right, I think you essentially guide it to around 760. So it's hard for a stock to work, when the estimates keep moving in the wrong direction. I'm just wondering how much does - do these things factor into your guidance philosophy this year, especially as it seems like your end markets are continuing to improve. And related to that, what are the bigger - biggest risks to guidance, from an earnings and EBITDA standpoint? And what are the biggest sources of potential upside? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Yes, sure. Let me see if I captured all that. As far as diagnostics goes, I think you're right, Doug. I mean, I think if you sort of think about diagnostics, maybe just outside of China, we are kind of mid-to-high single-digits here, for the guide. So I think you're right. I think we're pretty much in the zone of where we thought we would be. I mean, I think China is the big piece with VBP, and the respiratory headwinds. I think those are the two pieces. So I think we're pretty close to, where we thought we would be or where we aspire to be, which is, high-single-digits. So I feel pretty good about, where we are from a diagnostics perspective outside, of what we're seeing in China really and in respiratory. I guess, as far as guidance philosophy goes, I mean, I kind of - I don't necessarily look backwards. When we think about guidance and philosophy. I think we always try and do a bottoms up, what our businesses are telling us, what we are seeing and we try and incorporate that into the guidance. We do probably include some external factors like I talked about, I think in particular Life Sciences. Currently, there's been just kind of a lot of news, and maybe noise around that segment here. And I think we try to incorporate some of that news and noise into it, to be prudent, especially from a planning perspective early in the year. I want to make sure that not only for your purposes, but for my purposes internally, that we're setting the cost structure right, and we're setting expectations at a level that we can overdrive, if you will. So that's sort of our overall philosophy. I understand stock doesn't work when earnings are going down, but I would posit that there were some external things that, we had to work through in bioprocessing, as well as stimulus in China and some other things. I think we worked through them. I think we've done a pretty good job, of managing the cost structure. I think we - from a margin perspective, despite the fact that we've been down two years in a row, I really like where our margin profile is. So look, we try and build it from the bottom up. We try and tell you what we're seeing in the moment, and give you that information. That's how we've always thought about it and continue to do that.
Douglas Schenkel: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one -
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Rainer, I think good morning to you. I think you mentioned something around Life Science at Q1. Was there anything one-off in Q1, maybe which is different versus the rest of the year? I think you mentioned, Pall, maybe if you could elaborate on what the Q1 headwind is. We'll stop there?
Rainer Blair: Look, and Pall, in the prior year, so Q1 2024, we had a very, very large tens of millions energy project and that - that's giving us a one-off effect here in the first quarter along with some of the other things we talked about, more specifically. And again, looking at the first quarter guide here, in general, the trends really remain the same, as they were in the fourth quarter with the exception of diagnostics. Matt just talked about that. So, Bioprocessing, 6% to 7% core growth, that's consistent with the Q4 exit rate. Life Sciences, that they're expected to be consistent here in the tools sector. And here we go. Pall and the rest of the segment is getting off to a slower start in the first quarter, talked about the comp here just a minute ago. But we really saw two meaningful changes in diagnostics in the fourth quarter and Matt described some of those. One was the acceleration of volume-based procurement in China and the second is a slower start to the respiratory season. You bring that together between volume-based procurement and respiratory, that's about a 350 basis point headwind versus Q1 2024. But the underlying market as we just talked about in diagnostics everywhere, are growing mid-to-high single-digits with the exception of China. So we view this as an isolated topic, and we see that in the first quarter, and certainly expect every quarter thereafter to be better.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe my one follow-up on - is on capital deployment. Looks like Q1 is assuming a big share repurchase. How much of that is being contemplated in Q1 and rest of the year? And can you just remind us on - of your M&A criteria? I think there's been some chatter about deal activity picking up in the tool space. So how is the pipeline looking for you guys?
Matt McGrew: Yes, Vijay. So in Q4 and in Q1 collectively, we - so we started in Q4 and then kind of spilled over into Q1, if you will. We did buy back about 8 million shares for about $1.9 billion or so. So that's - that is complete.
Rainer Blair: And on the deal front, we see more activity out there, no doubt, and we see that in our funnels as well. So we're very active across all three segments, cultivating assets. And as it relates to the environment, not everywhere, but we're starting to see some pockets where valuations are getting a little bit better. So we feel very well-positioned here, Vijay, with the way our balance sheet sets up and we're going to remain disciplined as we always do around our deal philosophy. Where we have to be in the right end-market, with those secular growth drivers. I've got to like the asset or the company. And then, of course, the valuation framework, the model has to work as well. So we feel good, about where we're positioned. Markets are a little more active. The balance sheet looks good, we're going to remain disciplined.
Vijay Kumar: Okay. Understood. Thank you, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our last question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So I wanted to ask on some of the export control headlines that, we got earlier this month surrounding flow cytometry and mass spec. Can you walk us through are you expecting Danaher to be impacted this - by this at all? And then more conceptually, life sciences were usually viewed as a sector that was more insulated from some of these export controls. So how are you thinking about the risk here going forward? And do you expect that we could see other instruments potentially added to the list as well?
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Rachel. Thanks for the question. So the current export controls that have recently been published are really not meaningful for us. Our portfolio is positioned differently. And more generally speaking, this category has required export licenses for many years. So it's really not that new for life sciences, but what they've done is expanded the category a little bit to include some other technologies. So as we go forward, I think during the normal course of any administration, these kind of export controls are regularly reviewed and adjusted. But we don't expect anything particularly different than the standard process here, and at least to-date have not seen a meaningful impact to what we do.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Got it. And then my follow-up, I just have a multipart question here on Bioprocessing. So you mentioned that the recovery is underway. So how should we think about the pace of recovery throughout the year on Bioprocessing, and really what could we be exiting this year at for growth in that portion? And then other areas, just how are you thinking about some of the comps embedded? Especially in the first part of the year, you have some easy one-year comps, but also appreciate some of the multi-year stacks. And then lastly, what are you guys assuming at this point for standard seasonality by quarter on bioprocessing? Now, that's a lot in there? Thanks so much, you guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Rachel. Let me start-off with one more time that the recovery in bioprocessing is well underway, and we're really seeing it in nearly every category of the bioprocessing portfolio. So we see a positive development here throughout the year. That said, the way we've set up the guide is 6% to 7% core growth, essentially on a quarterly basis. That's how we're starting our perspective on the year here. And then, we'll see how that plays out. If you look at the multiyear stacks and that makes sense to do, you'll see that the math shows that this is right in line, with sort of a high single-digit growth rate, which is what we've talked about this market long - as its long-term growth rate. So we think that this is the right perspective, and we sure like the fact that the momentum is building here.
Matt McGrew: As far as seasonality goes, Rachel, we sort of Q1 in that business is usually the kind of the lightest. We see a bit of a step-up in Q2. And we do have a phenomenon there where Q3 is lower than Q2. That's always sort of been in that business. And some of the pandemic that didn't happen, but that is a normal trajectory where we see a step down Q2 to Q3, and then obviously a step-up in Q4. So sort of Q1, is your low-point, a little bit up in Q2, down in Q3, and then a big step-up in Q4.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Rachel.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears that we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back to our presenters, for any additional or closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, everybody. We're around all day for questions.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Ashley and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, Form 10-Q, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to the non-GAAP financial measures we'll be discussing during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website www.danaher.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 5, 2024. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to results from continuing operations and relate to the third quarter of 2024, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team delivered strong third quarter results with revenue, adjusted net earnings per share and cash flow, all coming in ahead of our expectations. We were especially pleased with the continued positive momentum in bioprocessing and another exceptional quarter at Cepheid and we enhanced our long term competitive advantage with the release of several impactful new innovations across our businesses. Now we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. A transformation in our portfolio over the last several years has created a focused life sciences and diagnostics leader positioned for higher long term growth, expanded margins and stronger cash flow. Danaher is purpose-built to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Our proven ability to innovate is enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses and helping customers reduce the time and cost needed to sustainably develop and deliver life-changing therapies. Now, the unique combination of our talented team, our differentiated science and technology portfolio and the power of the Danaher Business System positions us well as we seek to maximize value for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. So with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2024 results. Sales were $5.8 billion in the third quarter and we delivered 0.5% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets increased low single-digits with low single-digit growth in North America and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. High-growth markets were down mid-single-digits including a high single-digit decline in China. Our gross profit margin for the second quarter was 58.7% and our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.5% was down 10 basis points as accelerated investments in innovation offset the favorable impact of cost saving initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.71 were essentially flat year-over-year and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.8 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 135%. Now, let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment was flat year-over-year, with our bioprocessing business up low single-digits and our discovery and medical business down high single digits. In bioprocessing, we were encouraged with the continued positive momentum we saw in the quarter. Notably, orders increased high single-digits sequentially, which is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential order improvement, and our book-to-bill ratio improved to approximately 1.0. Now geographically, we saw improving order trends in developed markets as large customers are returning to more normal ordering patterns. In China, orders and underlying activity levels remain weak, particularly for equipment, as customers continue to conserve their capital. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our larger pharma, biopharma and CDMO customers. Production volumes at these customers, who are primarily manufacturing monoclonal antibody therapies, has continued to grow in line with historical averages. Now we've seen demand at these customers steadily improve throughout the year as they're moving past inventory destocking and anticipate this gradual recovery will continue over the coming quarters. In contrast, we're not seeing the same level of improvement in underlying performance from our smaller customers. Despite a modest improvement in the funding environment, they continue to rationalize their therapeutic programs and remain cautious with their investments. Now, putting this all together, we continue to expect low single-digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business for the full year 2024 and this includes an assumption of high single-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Now, as destocking moves behind us, we're increasingly excited about the long term opportunities ahead for Cytiva's leading bioprocessing franchise. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise the majority of our revenues, remain the largest investment area for our customers. We're also seeing accelerated adoption of these therapies and six of the top 10 highest revenue-generating drugs today are monoclonal antibodies. With our comprehensive portfolio, our best-in-class scientific services and innovation focused on increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we're very well positioned to support our customers today and well into the future. Now turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 2%, in line with our expectations. Core revenue in our life sciences instruments businesses collectively declined mid-single-digits with market conditions in the third quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Ongoing research and lab activity is driving growth in consumables and service, which was more than offset by a decline in capital equipment, particularly in China. Announced stimulus measures in China have not yet translated into meaningful order activity, as customers are still awaiting details on the implementation of these programs. Now, in the meantime, many customers are delaying purchasing decisions. Outside of China, our end markets are relatively stable, and we were encouraged to see early signs of improvement in demand among our pharma and biopharma customers, particularly in North America. Now, during the quarter, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences introduced the Cydem VT. Cydem VT is a fully automated, high-throughput cell culture system designed to simplify and accelerate the complex and lengthy process of clone screening and cell line development. Now, by harnessing the power of the Cydem VT, researchers can optimize workflows and reduce hands-on time by up to 90%, enabling them to efficiently identify the most promising clones and improve the success rate of their cell line development projects. In July, we completed the acquisition of Genedata, a leading provider of enterprise and workflow software used in drug discovery and development. Genedata's advanced software solutions automate complex R&D processes, enabling biopharma researchers to analyze and interpret samples more quickly. So we're really excited to welcome this innovative team to our Life Sciences segment. Now, Beckman Cydem VT and the acquisition of Genedata are both great examples of how we're strengthening our long term competitive advantage while helping our customers accelerate the drug discovery process. In our genomics consumables business, core revenue declined low single-digits, continuing the trends we saw in the second quarter. In August, IDT expanded its synthetic biology portfolio with the launch of Rapid Genes. These ready-to-use NGS-verified clonal genes are cost effective and offer fast turnaround, allowing pharmaceutical researchers to quickly pursue high-throughput experiments such as antibody development. IDT's long history of innovation is one of the key reasons the research community turns to IDT to help advance drug discovery and accelerate the pace of genomic medicine development. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment, core revenue increased 5%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single-digits, with strong global demand, partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China. Outside of China, recurring revenue was up high single-digits, driven by recent new product introductions and installed base expansion. The Beckman team continued their accelerated cadence of new product innovation this quarter with the release of the DxC 500i integrated chemistry and immunoassay analyzer. Now, the DxC 500i is specifically designed to improve efficiency and meet the unique workflow needs of low-volume laboratory customers such as community hospitals. So this highlights Beckman's commitment to serving the entire healthcare network by providing a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for low, mid and high-throughput core labs. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's core revenue increased double digits with broad-based strength across respiratory and non-respiratory assays. Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $425 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $200 million as we saw both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our four-in-one test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. Favorable volume was driven in part by customers purchasing in preparation for the upcoming respiratory season. Now, based on activity in the third quarter and our expectation of a respiratory season with normal severity, we expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.7 billion for the full year of 2024. Outside of respiratory, increasing menu adoption and system utilization helped drive another quarter of mid-teens growth in Cepheid's core non-respiratory reagent portfolio, including more than 20% growth in Group A Strep, sexual health and virology assays. We also saw strong installed base growth, particularly for our lower throughput systems, as customers continue to add GeneXpert instruments in their clinics and alternate care sites. So this expansion out of the hospital allows our customers to improve financial and clinical outcomes by standardizing care across their networks. I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase our differentiated diagnostics portfolio. During the event, we highlighted how DBS-driven innovation and commercial execution have meaningfully improved the growth and margin profile of our diagnostics franchise over the last several years. We also talked about how we are uniquely positioned for long term growth opportunities in high-value, high-need areas such as neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases and oncology. And if you haven't had the chance to see the replay, I'd encourage you to watch it on our Investor Relations website. Now, let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. For the full year 2024, there is no change to our previous guidance and as a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in low single-digit percent range and a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. In the fourth quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our better-than-expected third quarter performance and expect the trends we're seeing today to continue into Q4. Our team's commitment to executing and innovating with the Danaher Business System enabled us to deliver strong results while continuing to accelerate growth initiatives across the portfolio. Our third quarter results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher today. We have an outstanding group of businesses that serve attractive end markets with favorable long term, secular growth drivers. We're further enhancing our portfolio and competitive advantage with innovation that is helping customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. So, looking ahead, we believe this powerful combination of our leading portfolio, proven ability to innovate, and our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System provides a solid foundation for delivering differentiated long term financial performance. And so with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to probe into the instrument numbers a little bit, wondering if you can give us instrument growth ex-China and then just maybe talk a little bit about where it's worse and where it's getting better, whether it's flow, mass spec, lab automation, microscopy, and any leading indicators of funnel dynamics that make you feel better coming out of the quarter on the instrument side?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. Tycho, it's Matt, I'll give you the kind of the number on what it is. It's probably low to mid-single-digit ex-China. And then, Rainer, you want to kind of give color on what we're seeing on the instrument side?
Rainer Blair: Sure. No, absolutely. So -- and then, of course, in China, we would say that it's down high single-digits. But if you look at the developed markets, let's start with those. The end markets were relatively stable sequentially, but we haven't seen an inflection there yet, although in pharma and in biotech, while it remains soft, we're starting to see some early signs of improvement, especially in North America. On the academic research side, there we see it stable in North America, with Europe modestly weaker. But coming back to China, we're all aware, of course, of the announced stimulus, but that really hasn't translated into meaningful orders for us as customers continue to wait for those details. So -- and while they're waiting for those details, they tend to also delay perhaps the normal purchasing habits that they might have had. So the stimulus funding has yet to pick up here in the third quarter.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then a follow-up. I know you don't want to talk about '25 yet, but if we look at kind of the run rate for guidance on life sciences that you're giving us for the fourth quarter, the Street is at 6% next year on life sciences. Is that realistic, kind of, given the run rate you're laying out for the fourth quarter? And then anything you can say on China bioprocess for next year? We've seen some of your peers talk down numbers as well?
Rainer Blair: Tycho, we're still looking here to see how the fourth quarter plays out and to see whether we can see a pickup in the stimulus, particularly in China, while we do expect the developed markets to be stable along the lines that I just discussed for Q3. So we're looking to see how China's stimulus plays out here in Q4 before we can get to 2025 numbers. Now as it relates to bioprocessing, we continue to see there a low activity level, albeit stable, but at a lower level, and we expect that to take more time to play out here in the near term.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, maybe just to kind of follow up, I think the comment on the China stimulus is for tools, Tycho, right, just kind of what we're seeing there for '25 overall. So that's kind of '25 overall for Danaher for tools, but for bioprocessing for '25, I think we've kind of talked about a gradual recovery here in '24 and that's pretty well played out like we thought. Like Rainer said, we do need to see sort of how Q4 plays out, but -- before we kind of give anything formal on '25. But that said, the Q4 exit rate of high single-digits, an important kind of building block for us as we build backlog and visibility heading into 2025. But given what we've seen here through Q3, I think we're going to see a gradual recovery continue into '25.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then on the life science, the guidance, fourth quarter down low single-digit, but the Street next year is up 6%. I was trying to also reconcile whether that step-up is reasonable.
Rainer Blair: Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest factor there for -- as we look to next year will be what happens with the China stimulus for life sciences.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Hey, thanks. I actually want to just follow up on exactly your last point there on bioprocess sort of exit rate and how to think about 2025 and just how you're feeling about that market developing, the gradual recovery. You talked about, I think, five consecutive quarters of order growth there. In the last couple of quarters, you've had high single-digit order growth. Revenues for bioprocess have done well this year as well, but they've lagged the growth level. So it seems like there's a little bit of a lag in terms of the orders translating to revenue, which you would expect, obviously. Do you think that lag is closing? Do you think that we're getting closer as we hit 4Q? You talked about high single-digit bioprocess where you're going to start to see some of that order growth we've seen over the last quarters -- couple of quarters start to translate and again translates into next year?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I mean, I think, it's a perfect frame. I mean you think about exiting the year at high single-digits, but you kind of take a step back and you look at, from a core growth perspective, in 2024, we're going to be down low single-digits. And so as you sort of think about where we kind of exit the totality of '24 with that gradual sort of kind of recovery in mind as we head to '25, I think that's kind of the way that we're thinking about it from a perspective of what revenue will do next year based on the fact that the order trajectory has gotten better over the last five quarters. But like I said, I mean, it would be great for us to see Q4 here before we go. But I do think going down low single-digits this year in revenue, be positive next year we believe. But let's see where the trajectory goes here, given the fact that I do believe this is going to kind of be a continuation of what we saw in '24, which is a pretty gradual recovery. Very encouraging, though. So we're very happy with where we are.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. All right. And then, a follow-up, I want to ask on Cepheid, a couple quick questions, if I can. One is, you talked about timing of some purchasing of the kits in the quarter. Any chance you could quantify that? I know you did $425 million in respiratory versus the $200 million guide. Do you think that $225 million was timing or maybe was some of that organic beat and some of it was timing? Just trying to get a sense of how much pull forward there was from the fourth quarter. And in the press release, you also specifically called out Cepheid gaining market share in molecular testing. If you could expand on that, where are you gaining share in terms of customer or geographically? Any specifics there? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I mean, Mike, it's a little hard to parse out to the dollar, how much of the beat was related to pull-forwards versus just sort of better than we thought. I think probably, anecdotally from what we heard from customers, I would say that we do believe that there was -- a good portion of that was probably due to wanting to make sure that they had kind of the security of supply heading into the fourth quarter, which is not a huge surprise, I guess. But as we sort of look forward to the fourth quarter then, we did take that into account as we thought about what we might see here in the fourth quarter. So, I'd say a significant portion of the beat was probably related to that. As far as market shares go, I think I'd probably put it in two categories. I'd probably say, one, it's largely in the US, though that's not an absolute statement. I would say largely in the US. As you know, we are entirely in sort of hospitals as well as at near point of care. We've been doing very, very well with IDNs as we've expanded beyond their core hospitals into other point of care settings closer to the patient. That has continued here in the quarter, and I expect that, that would continue as well again with the installed base that we've been able to drive.
Michael Ryskin: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: We'll move next to Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. [Technical Difficulty]
Doug Schenkel: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess a couple of quick follow-ups. There's been a lot of questions that kind of dance around the 2025 question, which I'm sure you appreciate. When I look at numbers, the Street's looking for 8% core growth with bioprocessing growing double digits and life sciences growing 7%. You haven't said anything about anything resembling a snapback. Respiratory comps are going to be tough. VBP seems to be picking up in China. Stimulus activity follow-through seems unclear. And then just knowing you guys, you tend to be conservative. So cutting to the chase, am I missing anything? And should the street be modeling things at these levels recognizing you still want to see another quarter? But as we sit here today, the numbers look a smidge high to me. Am I missing anything?
Rainer Blair: Well, I don't think you're missing much here. If we just take a look real quick on how we're thinking about 2025, it's important to know that we need to see how Q4 plays out here. I'll come back to that in a minute, Doug. But there's still a couple important variables in Q4 that's going to shape the next year. And those relate to really the trajectory of the order book in bioprocessing. It's so important. So certainly the high single-digit core growth that we expect in bioprocessing for the fourth quarter is fully supported by backlog and what we expect in orders. But we also want to see more deeply into 2025 by seeing that orders momentum here continue into Q4. So that's going to be key here for understanding how the second half of 2025 plays out in bioprocessing. As it relates to respiratory for Cepheid and other key variable here, as we just talked about, there's been some purchasing ahead here in Q3 and based on what we saw in the southern hemisphere, we do expect the northern hemisphere to have a more normal respiratory season. And as you know, that straddles the first respiratory season of the year, straddles Q4 and Q1. And then lastly, and this is important for life sciences, but also more generally, we need to see how this China stimulus plays out in 2025, and we'd like to see some indicators of that accelerating here in Q4. To date, we've not really seen anything meaningful in that regard. So we're going to put numbers all around us here and then update you in January.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, super helpful, Rainer. And I guess another follow-up on just -- I mean, essentially trying to get at the question of the utility of the book-to-bill metric. Like, if we look at book-to-bill from Q3 of last year and this year and assume that bioprocessing accounts for roughly 85% of biotech sales, it seems like orders were up over 20% year-over-year. So I'm not sure if that math is right. That would be one question. But if it is, I'm just wondering how important is that as we think about the outlook for a return to robust bioprocessing growth, because I think there are some that are concluding that it's taking longer to convert. I think there's others that are assuming it's converting much more quickly than it used to. I guess we're just trying to get at how useful this metric is, especially keeping in mind, this is largely a consumable business at this point.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. I mean, I think we've talked in the past about book-to-bill being -- it's an interesting number and can be helpful in certain businesses. But traditionally or historically, we have not really used book-to-bill to kind of run this business for the exact reasons you said, lots of consumables and the timing of when the shipments hit. So I think from our perspective, book-to-bill is not something we spend a lot of time thinking about. But we do think about the orders. And as you said, the orders here in the quarter were north of 20%. Now, that is off of a very easy comp. So I think we need to have a little bit of restraint on what that means. But five quarters of sequential order growth is important. I think it's also -- what gave me a lot of encouragement in this quarter was, typically, we do see some seasonality where we go down from Q2 to Q3, we did not see that in this environment. I was encouraged by that, that we actually went up again sequentially. And so I sort of look at everything and think about my order growth rate, the percentages, even though they're off low numbers. That's important. The fact that we've had five sequential quarters in a row coming off of where we've been on the destocking, I think that's an important factor. So, yeah, to your point, I'm not sure book-to-bill is super critical for us, but maybe triangulating that with those other two factors, I really do think we're really happy with the trajectory of what we've seen in 2024 and what that means heading into 2025. But again, I think we've seen a pretty gradual build-up here in revenue and in orders, and I suspect that, that continues.
Doug Schenkel: Super helpful. All right, thanks, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, Rainer. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, one -- I want to ask on genomics here, low singles, maybe in the past you spoke about the sequencing versus gene editing, writing. What were trends between those two segments? And I think this Rapid Genes that you mentioned, maybe talk about what Rapid Genes is. And would you expect some share gains here due to launch of this product?
Rainer Blair: Sure, Vijay. We -- on the gene reading side of the house, we do still see the markets softer, as -- particularly in the smaller customer, emerging biotech segment, we see less activity. While the funding improved, those customers are still prioritizing their project quite a bit. And so we're seeing a bit less consumption in that area. Now in gene editing, of course, that's a different story, where we see a great deal of CRISPR and Guide RNA and other types of solutions doing very well. Having said that, and coming back to our new product launch here with Rapid Genes, we're very excited about that. This will offer whole genes to our customers at a quality and a turnaround time, which is highly differentiated in the market. We expect that, over time here, to provide us some tailwind. So we're very pleased here with how IDT is performing in this environment.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe, Matt, one for you. Your Q4 operating margin assumption, it came down a tad versus the prior. I think we're looking at low-30s exit rates. Is there some timing of expenses or anything changed on margin assumption? And if it is, any change in investments and implications here as we look at incremental margins for fiscal '25?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I mean, our full year margin didn't change, approximately 29%. Q4 will be at approximately 30%. I mean, I think it's probably a function of a couple of things. One, we're going to have -- we anticipate at least lower revenue in respiratory in Q4. Obviously, that has some margin implications to it. I think we did have a little bit of sort of timing, a little bit better bioprocessing in Q3 than we thought. And probably some of that might be a little bit of timing-related as well, sort of impacting Q4 margins. And as you said, we've had a pretty good year here. And as we head into the fourth quarter, we're thinking about the cost structure, thinking about the investments that we want to make in the business, and we're taking an opportunity to make sure that we do some of those smartly here in the quarter. And I think you sort of add it all up and you kind of come up with that adjusted operating margin in the 30s, sort of holding the full year here as we head into the end of the year.
Vijay Kumar: I'm sorry. The incremental margin implications for fiscal '25, should the fall-through be in the 35% to 40% range?
Matt McGrew: Well, I mean, it's going to depend on volume, I think, Vijay. But like we've kind of talked about from a margin perspective that this is -- this business when it is operating sort of in a normal environment, the low-30s are where it should be. So, I mean, '25, we'll sort of update you that in January when we get there. But that'll be a function of volume and mix, depending on where it comes from, it'll be different. So we'll have to until we get a little bit further to give you that, but that's sort of how I'm thinking about '25.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. Thank you, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, fellas.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: You guys mentioned again this quarter that the smaller customers in bioprocessing not coming back as fast. At what point does it become such a small piece of the business that maybe we stop having that color or it's less material? Or maybe a different way to ask the question is, what percent of revenues is it now where it's kind of large versus small customers?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I mean, the larger versus small, roughly, Scott, is kind of 75% are larger and 25% are smaller. And I think we give the color primarily because those smaller customers have a little bit of a different dynamic than the larger customers. Larger customers typically have on-market or later-phase, Phase 3 trial kind of exposures, whereas the smaller customers tend to be earlier-stage, probably a little bit more related to, in some instances, the cell and gene therapies of the world. So a little bit different. They act differently in the funding environment as well. So I think it's -- we're just trying to kind of give color as to what we're seeing there, where we are seeing an improvement in the funding environment. It's not necessarily working its way through into orders and revenue at this point. And so just to kind of give a little bit of color. But, to your point, I think is, most of our customers are the larger customers with stuff that is on-market. When I look back at what has caused all the pain of the last kind of two years in this business, it was destocking at those customers, and I believe that is largely behind us. And so that's why I think it's really encouraging. As we stand here and look forward, though, the recovery has been gradual, it has happened, it has happened at the largest customers, gives me a lot of faith that the long term outlook of this business still is the high single-digits. When we get there, kind of a bit of a TBD, but I think that's the reason we sort of want to give a little bit of color on both of them.
Scott Davis: Okay, that makes sense, Matt. And, guys, we didn't talk about the buyback or M&A or kind of your funnel or nothing mentioned in prepared remarks. Any update there as it relates to your confidence or size or any metrics around the funnel be helpful.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I'll just touch real quick on the buyback, and maybe Rainer can give some color on the funnel, the M&A funnel. But I mean, the buyback, I think if you see, we did complete it technically, that buyback was straddled, both Q2 and Q3. So if you see something in the queue, that's what it was related to, just so everybody's kind of clear, it was not a new issue. And so it was the final pieces, if you will, of the buyback that we talked about in Q2.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Matt. And as it relates to the M&A environment, Scott, as we do every day, we're out there cultivating across all of our segments, and we're fairly active there. Our funnels are pretty dynamic. It's fair to say that while the environment, though, is improving, valuations are still elevated. And so we feel great about our positioning both in terms of the assets that are attractive out there and, of course, our balance sheet. But we're going to maintain our discipline with our deals needing to meet our trifecta of attractive end market, attractive company and then, of course, the valuation framework, the model has to work as well. So active, but we still see that the valuations are elevated.
Scott Davis: Makes sense, Rainer. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Good luck, guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Puneet Souda: Yeah, hi, Rainer, Matt, thanks for taking my question. So, specifically on China, just following up on a few things, what's the right sort of jump-off point for China for -- as we think about 2025, just given the uncertainties here in the market and the backdrop of the stimulus? And also wondering if you can elaborate a bit on the China value-based pricing, how much of an impact are you baking there? And just lastly on China, how much is local bioprocess competition important in this market? And does that change your view for the long term growth of the worldwide bioprocess or biotech segment long term growth, just now that local competition has emerged and is being utilized more in some of those local maps?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, maybe I'll start, because I think your first question and your third question sort of wrapped around China for next year, and bioprocessing, maybe I'll let Rainer take that. But just VBP, just to remind everybody, we sort of assumed that it was going to be kind of $150 million of impact over three years really starting this year as we ramp up. Our assumptions initially were sort of that, that would be linear over the next three years. We are starting to see a little bit more activity in China around VBP here at the end of this year. So I think we'll have a better sense of what that linearity looks like after we get through next couple of months, where it does look like the activity is sort of ramping up. So I still think the number is a good number. But how that rolls out and plays out will sort of be determined in the next couple of weeks.
Rainer Blair: As it relates to the JOP, Puneet, really, I think we need to view China as stable and sort of bumping along the bottom. And we don't expect a change in that in the short term as we go through and think about 2025 unless we see a material change in the execution and rollout of the stimulus program in China. So we expect China to continue to develop as it has been here for most of the year in 2024. Now, as it relates to your question on local competition, certainly there's local competition out there, but we have to be clear that, particularly in biotech, there are many companies simply struggling to survive, and they're buying essentially the least expensive solution that they can to make it to the end of the month, and it's just going to have to be good enough. So that's sort of one section of the market. Then there's another segment that really is targeting the international sale of their therapeutic molecules. And they tend to want to have solutions from multinational companies, first and foremost from ourselves here and Cytiva in order to ensure that regulators around the world are comfortable with the inputs that are required to make these incredibly effective drugs. So, yes, there's local competition. We would see it more on the margin, especially as it relates to local molecules.
Puneet Souda: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. I'll leave it there.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Puneet.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to the trends in life science, instruments and equipment specifically, because I think you do have some consumables in that instrument reporting. Can you elaborate a bit further on what the equipment trends were in the quarter from a growth perspective?
Rainer Blair: So just to talk about the quarter more generally, the market conditions in third quarter were essentially consistent with what we saw in the first half of '24, and capital equipment spending continued to be constrained, and to the last question, particularly in China. Now, in contrast to the equipment-constrained environment, consumables and service grew in the quarter as lab and research facilities and institutions activity has started to stabilize. So we do see equipment being constrained, but consumables are starting to move.
Dan Leonard: And then a quick follow-up. Rainer, could you comment on the performance at Abcam? It seems like versus our numbers, the run rate there is improving. I'm unsure if that's the correct read or if it's just rounding, or if there's other M&A into that revenue mix?
Rainer Blair: There's no other M&A in that revenue mix. But of course, we're working very hard to drive our hypothesis around Abcam. And right now, the focus is on transitioning into Danaher, of course, and the team is making great progress with that. They're implementing, actually pulling on our DBS capabilities to drive those growth accelerators and, of course, improve the cost positioning that we've talked about. So we feel very good about where we are with Abcam and, long-term, we absolutely believe that this meets our expectations, both in terms of growth and the bottom line.
Dan Leonard: Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our final question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Rainer Blair: Hey, Jack.
Jack Meehan: I wanted to ask about diagnostics in the China region. To start, for Matt, can you just check my math is, can you remind me, is this like 15% diagnostic sales? And I was trying to back into how Beckman might have done in the quarter in the region, it could have been to the tune of down 20% or so. And then for Rainer, would just be great to hear about your thoughts on regional dynamics in diagnostics. Is this all kind of price impact or any change in kind of share shift? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. So diagnostics, the total revenue for China diagnostics, I think you're in the ballpark on that. As far as what China was -- from China diagnostics perspective in the quarter, I don't think it would have been down that high, Jack. Probably it was down in overall diagnostics, which -- most of that's going to be Beckman. It was kind of down low double-digits. So I think that's probably a more -- a better place to anchor. But I think your total number is probably pretty close to right as far as percentage sales.
Rainer Blair: We saw across the world here, really with one exception, strong performance in all of our clinical diagnostic businesses. And of course, you heard from Matt around Cepheid that we believe to be taking share there really at all levels. But coming back to our clinical diagnostic businesses, we saw a high single-digit recurring revenue growth in North America and Europe. On the other hand, we come back to China, and China, we see the impact of the volume-based procurement, which is what brings us down. We also had, in Beckman Coulter in particular, a high hardware sellout comp last year as we were burning down some backlog. But we're very pleased with how our clinical diagnostics businesses continue to develop, continue to take share, and volume-based procurement is sort of the topic right now for diagnostics in China.
Operator: Thank you. And this will conclude our Q&A session. I'll turn the call over to John for closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thank you, everybody, for joining today. We'll be around for follow-ups all day, rest of the week. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 6, 2024. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to results from continuing operations and relate to the second quarter of 2024 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.

During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer M. Blair: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well during the second quarter, delivering better than expected revenue, earnings, and cash flow. We were particularly pleased with the sustained positive momentum in our bioprocessing business, and with the strong performance of Cepheid, which we believe gained market share in molecular testing again this quarter. Now across the portfolio, market conditions were largely as we anticipated. In our bioprocessing business, conditions in the U.S. and Europe continued to improve, and we were encouraged to see orders increase high single digits sequentially this quarter. In China, bioprocessing demand and underlying activity levers were stable sequentially, but remained weak as customers continued to manage liquidity. In Life Sciences, capital equipment investments remained constrained while recurring revenue was relatively stable. And in Diagnostics, we saw healthy demand globally across our businesses. As we move through this transitional period, we believe Danaher is well positioned for sustainable long-term value creation. Our strong positioning and attractive end markets coupled with durable, high-recurring revenue business models, and the power of the Danaher business system supports our long-term expectations of high single-digit core revenue growth with a differentiated margin and cash flow profile. So with that, let's take a closer look at our second quarter 2024 results. Sales were $5.7 billion in the second quarter and core revenue declined 3.5%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were down low single digits with strength across Diagnostics offset by declines in Biotechnology and Life Sciences. High growth markets declined high single digits, including a high-teens decline in China. Our growth profit margin for the second quarter was 59.7% and our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.3% was up 60 basis points as the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives more than offset lower volume. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were essentially flat year-over-year. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.6 billion a year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 129%. Now additionally, through the second quarter and into July, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares. While M&A remains our bias for capital deployment, we believe these repurchases will provide an attractive return given the strength of our long-term organic growth, earnings, and cash flow outlook. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our biotechnology segment declined 7% with the bioprocessing business down high single digits and the discovery and medical business down mid-single digits. In our bioprocessing business, revenue declines moderated from the first quarter as we believe our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe have worked through the majority of their excess inventories and are returning to normal ordering patterns. Many of these customers are also seeing strong momentum for therapeutics in their late stage pipelines, which is promising for our future growth. Our emerging biotech customers continue to prioritize projects, particularly for cell and gene therapies in an effort to manage liquidity. However, we are encouraged by the improvement in the overall funding environment, which is a positive leading indicator for these customers. So based on the trends we saw through the first half of the year, we continue to expect a low single digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business for the full year of 2024. There is also no change to our assumption of a bioprocessing core revenue growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit the year. Biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments both in development and production. Notably, the number of new FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines in the first half of this year nearly doubled compared to the first half of 2023, and the full year 2024 is on track to set a new record. Underlying demand for biologic medicines also remains on track to grow at a high single digit or better rate again for the full year 2024. So given this substantial and sustained increase in approvals and production volumes, we expect the growth rate in bioprocessing to remain very robust for many years to come. We continue to make substantial investments in innovation to support our customers as they pursue these life-changing therapeutics. To support monoclonal antibody production, which comprises the majority of our bioprocessing revenues, Cytiva expanded its comprehensive filtration portfolio with the launch of Supor Prime. Now Supor Prime filters are specifically designed to address key challenges associated with high concentration biologic drugs whose complex formulations and high particle loads make them prone to premature filter blockage and costly drug product losses. We're also developing innovative solutions for emerging modalities. In May, Cytiva introduced the Cepheid Cell Therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR-T Cell Therapy manufacturing. The Cepheid platforms fully automated manufacturing process can increase productivity by up to 50% per year compared to the industry standard, reducing our customers' costs and increasing throughput. Addressing these key manufacturing challenges, will help improve patient access and facilitate wider adoption of these important therapeutics. Now, turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 5.5%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences Instrument businesses collectively declined high single digits as expected, with trends in the second quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Global pharma and biotech demand remained weak, academic markets were weaker sequentially, and applied markets performed comparatively better, particularly for our advanced solutions which provide critical capabilities needed by our customers. In China, we're seeing improving sales models and coding activity driven by the recently announced stimulus measures. However, we don't anticipate this to convert to orders until 2025, as these programs are in early stages of implementation. So in the meantime, many customers are delaying purchasing decisions as they await funding. Now, last month at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Meeting, SCIEX reinforced their market leadership in Quantitative Mass Spectrometry with the release of the 7,500-plus triple-quad mass spectrometer. The 7,500-plus pairs the ultra-high sensitivity of the 7,500 with faster acquisition speeds and the ability to maintain the highest sensitivity quantitation and the ability to maintain the highest sensitivity quantitation for up to twice as many sample runs. This makes the 7,500 plus particularly well-suited for complex applications such as PFAS analysis where customers need to test more samples across diverse sample types with high precision to meet challenging new regulations. In our genomics consumables business, core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. High-single digit growth in gene writing and editing solutions was more than offset by declines in next generation sequencing and the impact of project timing in our plasmids business. During the quarter, IDT opened a new manufacturing facility at their Coreville, Iowa campus which enabled the team to manufacture differentiated new offerings such as rapid gene synthesis. This is the second facility expansion for IDT within the last 12 months and provides the capacity needed to support the rapidly expanding global DNA synthesis market and related drug development activities. Now moving over to our Diagnostic segment, core revenue increased 3%. Our Clinical Diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth led by high-single digit growth at Radiometer. Leica Biosystems was up mid-single digits with notable strengths in digital pathology driven by a Aperio GT 450 diagnostics digital pathology slide scanner which recently received its FDA 510K clearance. Beckman Colter Diagnostics was up low single digits with balanced strengths across both developed and high growth markets. Now in May Beckman received FDA 510K clearance of its Access NT ProBNP on the DxI 9000 immunoassay analyzer. This important expansion of Beckman's cardiac testing menu allows clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose and assess the condition severity of patients suspected of having acute heart failure. Now this clearance is just the latest confirmation of the DxI 9000 platform’s capability to develop increasingly more sensitive and clinically relevant diagnostics. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid’s respiratory revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $200 million driven by both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 tests for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. So we continue to expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.6 billion for the full year 2024. Now as I mentioned earlier, we believe the Cepheid team continued to gain market share during the quarter. Increasing menu adoption and system utilization helped drive mid-teens growth in our core non-respiratory reagent portfolio, including more than 20% growth in sexual health and virology assays. We also continued to expand our nearly 60,000 system installed base as many existing healthcare systems and integrated delivery network customers are adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to patients. In June, the FDA granted Cepheid marketing authorization for its Hepatitis C RNA test. Hepatitis C diagnosis has traditionally been a multi-step process requiring follow-up appointments and leading to treatment delays. With Cepheid's tests, which is the first molecular-based point of care test for Hepatitis C, patients can be tested and receive treatment during the same healthcare visit. So this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy to use molecular testing closer to patients is improving treatment outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid. Now before we move on to our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our recently released 2024 Sustainability Report, which detailed several important milestones across the three pillars of our sustainability program. Starting with building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and our planet, and protecting our environment. Notably, we have committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the science-based target initiative, including reaching net zero value chain emissions by 2050. So I encourage you all to read through the report to learn more about the depth and scope of Danaher’s commitment to sustainability and the important work we're doing to make a positive, holistic impact on the world around us. So now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year 2024. In the third quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect a third-quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%. For the full year 2024, there is no change to our previous guidance. As a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in the low single-digit percent range and a full-year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and are encouraged by the continued momentum in our bioprocessing business. Our strong performance is a testament to our team and their commitment to innovating and executing with the Danaher business system. And they have done a tremendous job navigating the current environment to support our customers' life-changing work today, while also delivering breakthrough innovation that is reinforcing our long-term competitive advantage. The transformation in our portfolio over the last several years has created a focused Life Sciences and Diagnostic leader positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins, and stronger cash flow. And our recent share repurchases reflect our conviction in a bright future ahead for Danaher. So looking ahead, the unique combination of our incredibly talented team, the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, and a leading financial profile provides us with a strong foundation to create sustainable, long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call back to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. And Rainer I appreciate all the color on Bioprocessing. Two follow-ups. First is on the consumables. Can you elaborate on what's giving you the confidence that the stock is drawing to a conclusion here? And then on the capital equipment side, just thoughts on how long this will remain depressed, when you might start to see some improvement there?
Rainer M. Blair: So Jack, on the consumable side, we've really seen ordering patterns back to normal with very, very few exceptions and with pretty clear visibility through the measures that we put in place to stay close to our customers here during the destocking period. We feel that we're very close to normal order patterns. And keep in mind, we actively monitor our customers on a customer-by-customer basis. And in addition to that, we really took active measures here to ensure that inventories were normalized. And you'll recall that we took decisions to ensure that we took the dysfunction in the supply chain out to ensure that we had a true demand signal. And we think that's paid off here, and we know where our customers sit in terms of their stock levels on consumables. Now equipment is a slightly different picture. We're seeing good activity there at some of our larger customers, and that played out here in the second quarter as well, with the sequential order growth being high single digits and being positive for both equipment and consumables. And so, those larger customers really do have a higher activity level, whereas the smaller customers probably remain a little bit more constrained.
Jack Meehan: Awesome. And then, we're just trying to piece together the mosaic here. So your bioprocessing orders increased high single digits when your peers declined sequentially. I think there's a lot of plausible explanations being thrown around for why the results in the quarter diverged. I was just curious if you could weigh in on what you think is the right signal, what's the noise?
Rainer M. Blair: Well, from a competitive perspective, Jack, everyone has slightly different positioning, whether it's by product category or geography or even customer type. Now, if you look at us, we're probably the broadest and the deepest in terms of our portfolio, both upstream and downstream, while some others are perhaps a little bit more concentrated. So, given that, it's always going to be hard to really line up the various players in the industry to have a perfect read-across. But again, the good news here is that this is a great business, and it's recovering as we expected, and we're confident about the future.
Jack Meehan: Excellent. Thank you.
Rainer M. Blair: Thanks, Jack.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Hey, good morning, you guys, and thanks for taking the questions. So another one here just on bioprocessing. So on the 3Q guidance, can you just walk us through what's contemplated in 3Q guide, we've seen a few quarters of sequential progression on orders during the last three quarters in a row sequentially. So walk us through how much of this is just seasonality on the step down into 3Q versus is there some conservatism in there? And then also on orders, should we expect seasonality to also impact on the order book for bioprocessing in 3Q as well?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. No, I think that's in bioprocessing in particular. We probably should talk about bioprocessing and respiratory for Q3. So if you think about sort of revenue, we've got bioprocessing is going to be down low single digits, which is again kind of a continued improvement versus what we saw in Q1 and Q2. We were down kind of high teens in Q1, high single digits in Q2, and we think that that goes to kind of low single digits here in Q3. Given like Rainer just said, I think we're largely through the destocking sort of on the consumable side. A little bit easier comps in China as well, so that probably helps a little. But if you think about sort of the two big drivers of Q3, outside of even Bioprocessing, when you think about sort of the guide in totality, you have two issues or two things to think about. We've got lower volume in Biotechnology like I just talked about and in respiratory as well. So Biotechnology prior to the pandemic, we sort of had sort of a step down between Q2 and Q3 seasonally. That was always the case for the business and we're kind of monitoring -– we're putting that in sequentially again here in our guide. We were about down mid-single digits prior to the pandemic from a revenue perspective. And so, that's kind of what we assumed in the guide, that we would have that sort of step down that we normally have seen. Given the fact that we're back at normal order patterns, we sort of believe that we're going to have a normal seasonality as well. So, you kind of factor that in for bioprocessing. And then on respiratory, we're assuming $200 million of revenue versus $300 million here in the quarter. So, the two of those kind of combined are the reason that you've got the Q3 revenue where it is. And I might also add, just to kind of get out in front of them, maybe the next question on margins, that's a big reason why we're kind of guiding to approximately 26% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Those two businesses sort of being a little bit lower sequentially here, given their margin profile, that's the big driver, if not the full driver of what's happening on the margin perspective as well.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great, thanks. And then my follow-up here, just on 2025, there's been a lot of noise across the industry on 2025 and where we'll be at from an underlying market growth standpoint as well. So, you reiterated exiting this year in bioprocessing at high single digits or above, but could you just walk us through how are you thinking about the total business in terms of 2025 in relation to that underlying market? And then you've also talked a lot about the incremental margins on bioprocessing and some of that durability on the margin expansion and diagnostics as well. So, Street's currently at $8.70 or so in EPS $1.25, how are you feeling about that number, any early takes there would be helpful? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. We just finished the second quarter year of 2024, so we still have a lot of work left to do in 2024 before we think about 2025. We have always sort of guided here in January. I think that is still the plan. Plenty of work left to do here in the quarter from a top-line perspective, but clearly we are seeing the improvements. We thought clearly, this is playing out, at least in bioprocessing, like we thought on the top line. And so, maybe what we should do is let's just get through Q3 here, and then we can kind of revisit the fourth quarter and 2025 as we get there. From a margin perspective, I think we have sort of historically talked, both -- like I talked on the last call, Q4 and Q1 will typically be better margin quarters for us, given like you said, the operating leverage that we get out of bioprocessing and respiratory, I don't think that, that will be any different here in this year. But as far as over the long term, as I think about next year from a margin perspective, we've talked about this business being a 35% to 40% kind of incremental fall through. I don't see any reason why that would not be the case, especially as we sort of return to growth in bioprocessing. I think we've been close to those levels here as we've been shrinking, frankly. So I think we've done a lot on the cost structure to be able to make sure that we can continue to do that. But I think over time, 35%, 40% fall through, and this is a business in a normal time that our adjusted operating margin should be in the low 30s.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rainer M. Blair: Good morning Scott.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning Rainer and Matt and John. The buyback, I don't recall seeing one at least one of this size in the past. What's -- just a little color, is it maybe a statement that M&A is a little slow or is it -- should you guys think about it as a little bit more like housekeeping, what slow color on how you thought through the buyback? Thanks.
Rainer M. Blair: Well Scott, first, it's important to note that this is not a change on our view on capital allocation. So we maintain a strong bias towards M&A, and we're going to continue to be active on the M&A front. Now having said that, as always, we evaluate capital allocation using the same ROIC lens, whether it's M&A, buyback, R&D projects, CAPEX and so forth. So we evaluate all of these investment options based on the expected returns. And specifically in today's environment, the relative value of a buyback generates attractive financial returns. So we're buying a great business, one we know very well. We have strong conviction about its future while maintaining a meaningful M&A envelope. And I put out there this, this is important that our free cash flow is nearly $6 billion and our net leverage is about two turns. So we feel well positioned here with various alternatives.
Scott Davis: Makes sense, Rainer. Guys, well the book-to-bill in Cytiva, will that cross 1 in 3Q or maybe said a different way, has it already crossed 1 since we're already a month into the quarter?
Rainer M. Blair: Well, our book-to-bill is 0.9, Scott. And as we've said, in order to make our full year guide here of bioprocessing being down low single digits we have to maintain the 0.9. And that's certainly how the first half has played out here, and we're confident that, that will continue to be the case. As you know, we don't guide to book-to-bills or orders, but basically the guide is built on the assumption that as we have 0.9 here for the year, we'll exit our year with high single-digit or better growth.
Scott Davis: Thanks a lot Rainer, thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Rainer M. Blair: Thanks Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hi Rainer. Good morning to you and congrats on a nice finish here. One, maybe a high level on -- maybe talk about the competitive pricing environment. Any change, I think where I'm going with the question is given the mix it signals from different players, there is some fear whether competitive pricing environment could be great, so maybe talk about what you're seeing in the market?
Rainer M. Blair: Vijay, look for the second quarter, all up for Danaher, our pricing was up 100 basis points right around there. And for 2024 as a whole, we think we will likely be a little above our historical average of 75 to 100 basis points. So we feel good about our positioning, the leverage in our portfolio, and how we've positioned here price-wise.
Matt McGrew: As far as -- I think you're probably referring to bioprocessing price, Vijay. We did about 2.5% here in the quarter. It's probably a pretty good marker for the full year. We were getting better price in the last couple of years, probably 4%, 5% type price, but that was also in an environment where we had supply chain and other challenges from an inflationary perspective that we're getting more price to offset some of that. So some of those concerns sort of fall off, if you will, the price comes down. But fundamentally, from a competitive perspective, I don't think we're seeing significant price pressures. It's much more a function of just coming back to where we used to be, which is in bioprocessing, 100 to 200 basis points.
Vijay Kumar: Okay. That's helpful, Matt. Rainer, one more and a bigger picture on China. What's been the historical relationship between code activity and when that translates to orders and revenues, is there any way to quantify when you say China code activity has picked up, is that above trend versus historical averages above trend, any framework would be helpful?
Rainer M. Blair: Sure. Well, in China, what we're seeing is increased activity levels in our funnel. So the volumes that we see in our funnel has been growing and that's all related to people in the market getting ready for this stimulus funding, if you will, with sort of shovel-ready projects. But what we're also seeing is a decrease in the funnel velocity as naturally market players are looking to see what the financing terms and conditions for the stimulus are. So we have watched this development. This is expected for us. This is not new news. We expected that the market would hold up to see what the funding alternatives would be. And we don't expect to see the funnel convert into orders in any meaningful way here in 2024. We view that more as a 2025 event that people are waiting for their shovel-ready projects to receive funding.
Vijay Kumar: Understood, thanks guys.
Rainer M. Blair: Thanks Vijay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask on Life Sciences segment. I think you flagged instruments still down high single digits. And that's a small part of the business, but it still seems like Life Sciences as a whole isn't seeing a lot of improvement yet. You also called out NGS, I think being a little bit weaker. So some parts of consumables are impacted. So just as a whole for Life Sciences, both instruments and consumables, can you dive a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing in the end market, any improvement in order trends there, just how should we expect the second half to play out?
Rainer M. Blair: Sure, Mike. Well, let's start with the quarter. So overall, the second quarter came in, as expected, down high single digits with the market conditions largely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, with capital equipment more constrained, particularly in China, while consumables and services held up comparatively better. Now in developed markets, pharma and biotech remain soft but stable sequentially, while academic markets were modestly weaker and applied markets continue to hold up well, particularly for more advanced instrumentation that you need for complicated applications such as PFAS, clinical, and so forth. And coming back to China here, and to build on my comments to Vijay's question, the recent stimulus measures are really driving improved funnels and coding activity, but we don't expect that to convert to orders until 2025. So as expected, we're starting to see customers delaying their purchasing decisions there as they await the stimulus funding. Now as you think about the second quarter -- the second half, excuse me, we're going to see the comps easing a bit, and that will certainly contribute to some stabilization. But we would expect this normalization process for Life Science tools and consumables to continue through 2024.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. 2025 is it?
Rainer M. Blair: Through 2024.
Michael Ryskin: The end of 2024, okay, alright, thank you. And then on Cepheid on the Diagnostics side. I mean you talked about respiratory coming in a little bit stronger at $300 million. But the rest of Diagnostics and the rest of major diagnostics specifically, still seem a little bit choppy in the Q you called out a decline in core sales [indiscernible]. So could you talk about what you're seeing in Diagnostics outside of respiratory business?
Rainer M. Blair: Sure. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our non-respiratory businesses with good customer activity around the world. And in particular, if you think about Cepheid, both respiratory and non-respiratory reagents were up. So non-respiratory was actually up mid-teens. And here you see the Cepheid strategy playing out, increasing that installed base, increasing menu adoption and utilization; virology, a relatively new assay, up 20% in the second quarter. And we're, of course, benefiting from recent menu expansion such as in sexual health, which is also up 20%. And then you heard us launch the new assay and receive approvals for Hepatitis C, and we look forward to seeing its growth journey going forward. So as you look at Cepheid, that strategy plays out. We continue to take share and grew both in respiratory and non-respiratory testing. We have there a little bit of a year-over-year with equipment being a little bit down and that nudged it just into a small negative growth here for the second quarter. Now as you look at the remaining businesses, Beckman grew low single digits. But really, the Beckman Diagnostics continues with this momentum with recurring revenue growing at mid-single digits again this quarter, and the overall moderation there for Beckman is really related to some challenging equipment comps. We had a lot of backlog that we needed to ship out last year, and that's affecting the compare here a little bit. But Beckman Diagnostics really is a mid-single-digit long-term grower. It's got a full innovation pipeline. The commercial execution is outstanding. We've got great instrument placement. And we've done a lot on the innovation front. We just talked about the Access NT proBNP, which has expanded our cardiac menu in the second quarter. And we've done a full refresh of our product line with the immunoassay DxI 9000; on chemistry, the DxC 500 and in automation, the DxA 5000. So coupled with our execution, we see our diagnostics businesses poised and positioned very well here, both competitively and for the long term.
Michael Ryskin: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Daniel Brennan: Hey, great, thanks. Good morning Rainer, how are you doing. And Matt thanks for the questions here. Maybe just going back to Scott's question on the buyback. The Danaher stock has been one of the best performers over the past 5 and 10-year period. So arguably, you could say the ROIC on buybacks was consistently attractive during the period of time. And as mentioned, you guys historically don't really buy back stock and your business model is really predicated on M&A and deploying DBS. So could you just elaborate a bit on the M&A environment today, maybe what's holding things back, and what's your confidence in employing meaningful capital for M&A as we look out over the next few years?
Matt McGrew: Yes, Dan, maybe I'll start. I mean, look, we sort of maybe -- maybe this is the way to think about it. We like this portfolio. We like how we're positioned for the future. We like the growth where we're going to be here. The portfolio moves through the last five years have been sort of -- the fog of COVID, if you will, has really sort of made it hard to see what we think this business is capable of. We've talked about it with everybody in the past. I mean this is a high single-digit growth business, 60% gross margins, 30% OP with free cash flow conversion north of 100%. We like our business. And when I see what we trade at, today and then I kind of look out at what some of the still current M&A multiples are, it's just from a return perspective, we're getting as good of a return, if not better, on some of -- on the buyback than we would at some of these levels. And we just think that in today's environment, the buyback made sense. But that is in today's environment. Our bias still is towards M&A, but I do believe that we've got a bit of a disconnect here still in today's environment. And we are kind of making a bet, if you will, on a business that we know well and that we think has got a lot of upside.
Daniel Brennan: Great, thanks Matt for that. And maybe just one, if I could just go back to the Q3 guide for Bioprocess and the normal seasonality. Q2 did come in ahead of expectations and you're maintaining the full year guide. So is there anything in Q2 in terms of a pull forward or timing or is there any change to your view that as inventories normalize, which I think you've said in the past, you would see a real nice recovery as I think you guys have talked about the math of seeing like a nice kind of growth rate as things normalize?
Matt McGrew: Yes. No, nothing, I would say, for bioprocessing and the same for respiratory. I would say there's nothing that we saw in Q2 that is causing us consternation about the normal seasonality. I think this is really about returning to a normal seasonal pattern, where typically in bioprocessing, we are seeing mid-single-digit decline sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And for planning purposes, because we are largely past destocking and because we see the customer order patterns sort of coming back to normal, for planning purposes we are going to plan on that same mid-single-digit decline from a revenue perspective sequentially, but that does not change anything in the underlying what we've seen in the business. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than this is a sequential normal historical revenue pattern, and we are assuming that in the guidance.
Daniel Brennan: Great, thanks Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Rainer M. Blair: Hi Doug.
Douglas Schenkel: Good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions. First, I got a two parter on bioprocessing, and then I want to pivot back to China. So on bioprocessing, it seems like you need continued improvement in the end market to exit the year growing high single digits, meaning this is more than just year-over-year comparisons. It does seem like you're expecting continued improvement there. Just given how the last couple of years have gone in the market, even acknowledging what you talked about in terms of encouraging trends, I'm just wondering how you got comfortable with any risk to that assumption? So that's the first question. The second is on new modalities. In the near term and then just looking ahead, how has your business associated with new modalities performed recently and what's your expectation for mix, new modalities versus MAB contributions moving forward based on what you're seeing in the market right now, that obviously could be an accelerator to growth over the coming quarters? And then finally, on China, just regarding the slowdown in purchasing related to stimulus -- pending stimulus. I'm just wondering how broad based this is and where you're seeing the most headwinds as folks basically try to get better clarity on where the money is going to be allocated and when? Thank you very much.
Rainer M. Blair: Sure. Let's start with how we get comfortable with our view on bioprocessing and its future. And I think it's important to level set one more time on the performance that we've seen here in the first half. Starting with the second quarter which, again, it has played out as we thought. We saw improvement in revenue and orders, second quarter in a row in both consumables and equipment. And you'll recall from our commentary in the last quarter's comments that we wanted to see that improvement in equipment, and we did. And our core revenue improved nearly 1,000 basis points from down high teens, Matt talked about this, to down high single digits. And again, orders grew high single digits sequentially from Q1, which is an acceleration from the mid-single digit. So we do see strength there. And that's because destocking is largely behind us, and there are very few exceptions, and those order patterns are more and more similar to the pre-pandemic levels, which is also why in our guide here for Q3, we've talked about seasonality again, something that we haven't seen and we'll consider the anomalous last eight quarters or so. So those ordering patterns are returning to what we saw in the pre pandemic level. And again, important to note here, large customers with on-market drugs continue to grow because that underlying large molecule demand remains at historical growth rates, and we talked about that high single digits maybe even low double digits, but certainly at the historical rates, which continues to provide that demand signal through the entire value chain. At the same time, development pipelines remain very solid across the board. But if we look at Phase III, that's particularly strong. In fact, we would say it is stronger than it had been prior to the pandemic, and that further underwrites our long-term growth expectations. Now we talked about some of the smaller biotech customers, and that's where you tend to see some of these advanced modalities. Let's just call them for the sake of argument right now nucleic acid-based therapies, and perhaps a couple of other type bispecifics ADCs. And what we see there is that they have been over proportionately impacted by some of the funding contraction that we saw in the venture capital market, but that's improved, which is encouraging. But again, those smaller players really do need to focus on their most promising projects to play that. And that's going to have an effect on how much capital they spend on equipment. So if a particular player is positioned and their portfolio is skewed more towards these advanced therapies and the smaller customers where cash remains fairly tight, then that's going to impact the order book. With our broader portfolio, particularly with our skew towards commercialized drugs and those in late phases, we see that strength, and that's another reason why we feel good about exiting 2024 at high single digits or better. Now coming back to your question here on new modalities. New modalities are exciting. They're a small part of our business, and they're a small part of the overall market. Keep in mind, our business is driven by protein therapies in their various forms. And of course, we also are a leading player for the advanced therapies. But if you calibrate, this is a much smaller part of both our business and the market, and it's going to have a fair amount of variability, both in success rates in terms of the approvals that these advanced therapies received, but also in terms of the uptake and the reimbursement dynamics associated with those. So I think we're just at the very beginning of that trend to these advanced modalities going on. Lastly, China. The slowdown that we're seeing is really fairly broad-based. As you look at our portfolio, Life Science Equipment, in particular, has a research and more academic focus, and that's where you see a lot of waiting for the stimulus funds to be dispersed. And that segment is ready. The applications are filed. They're in the funnel, so to speak, but we need to see the disbursement of that. And we're not counting on that happening in any material form here in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Rainer M. Blair: Hey Tycho, welcome back.
Tycho Peterson: Thank you, thank you. Rainer, I want to go back to instruments for just a minute and kind of your background, obviously, in SCIEX back in the day. Just thinking about the replacement cycle, we get a lot of questions on that for mass spec. How do you think about that potentially kicking in over the next couple of years, because I think there's some debate that some of that got pulled forward during COVID and maybe it's going to be more muted this cycle when you do start to see the replacement cycle from that aspect [ph]?
Rainer M. Blair: So I think we would support that hypothesis that the additional funding and the various market subsidies pulled forward demand and replaced a lot of equipment out there during the pandemic and immediately following that. And that's why we've talked about the need, and we're experiencing that normalization period right now. And that replacement cycle is going to remain intact. And that's why we would say we're probably sort of in the early innings, mid-innings here of that recovery, the first step that we're probably going to see here are the lower comps in the second half. And it's probably going to take 2025 to start approaching that normal replacement cycle again, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then on bioprocess, I appreciate all the color. We started to get more questions on yield improvements. I'm wondering how you think about that, just your customers getting more efficient and then how do you think about capacity kind of freeing up in the industry, whether it's Novo selling off some of the talent capacity or Wushi [ph] having to get rid of some capacity in the U.S. Just curious how you think about that playing into kind of the equipment side of things? And then maybe the last part, just what's your view on kind of doing more on the services side, CDMO type work and adding your own capacity?
Rainer M. Blair: So starting with yields and improving customer yields, that's what we do. Our focus in bioprocessing is to help our customers improve the yields and there's plenty of opportunity for that to ultimately lower the total cost of manufacturing of these life-saving certainly quality of life improving drugs and to improve accessibility to these drugs around the world. So that's what we do. And we don't view that as an inhibitor to growth. On the contrary, through creating more value for our customers, we see more opportunity for growth there and differentiation and believe that we're very well positioned. Now as we think about capacity here in the marketplace, we actually believe that capacity certainly for commercial production and what is in Phase III needs to increase. We don't believe that in the large manufacturers, pharma or CDMO, that ultimately there is sufficient capacity for the long term, and we would expect that capacity to continue to increase, and there's moves in the marketplace that demonstrate that. And that underwrites also our perspective on equipment orders growth. Now as it relates to services, we've talked about that at length. We're very focused on the scope of the businesses that we have. We're excited about investing in those businesses and helping our customers do what they do. We do provide services in order to help them with some of their most complex and new therapies and then ultimately the tech transfers to either the pharma company itself or its CDMO partner.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thank you everybody for joining. We'll be around all day and rest of the week for questions. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude Danaher Corporation's second quarter 2024 earnings results conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-14 08:00:00) =====
Michael Ryskin: Everyone will kick things off for our next session. My name is Mike Ryskin. I'm on the Bank of America Life Science Tools and Diagnostics teams and I'm thrilled to host Danaher and I'm joined by Rainer Blair, CEO. Rainer, thanks so much for coming.
Rainer Blair: Mike, thanks for having us.
Michael Ryskin: We'll do a fireside chat as usual, but just kick things off. You reported 1Q a couple of weeks ago, first name out of the gate, set the tone for tools. Pretty impressive quarter, good start to the year. Anything you want to call out, any opening remarks you want to make?
Rainer Blair: We did have a good start to the year and it started really with our top line performance. We contracted only 4% versus our guide of high single digits and delivered very strong operating margins of 30%, which also exceeded our guide. All that, of course, drove a very strong cash flow of $1.4 billion for the quarter. So, we're gratified and encouraged by the start to the year and look forward to the rest of the year as it develops.
Q - Michael Ryskin: So, first question, obligatory, has to be about bioprocessing. A lot of debate there, a lot of focus there. Decline was high teens, but slightly better than expected. You had a nice sequential improvement in book-to-bill, order growth. So, could you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the bioprocess end markets, inventory destocking, and just sort of visibility over the last couple quarters?
Rainer Blair: We did have a moderate beat here versus our expectations in bioprocessing. What we found particularly encouraging was the sequential orders growth of mid single digits. Typically, when we go from Q4 to Q1 of any year, we see a decline in orders, but we thought it was noteworthy and encouraging that we saw a mid single digit growth here in the sequential orders development. I think another point which was encouraging in the quarter for bioprocessing is that our book-to-bill moved from the prior quarter's book-to-bill, which was around 0.8, 0.85, to in the first quarter of this year, 0.95. So that's encouraging. That's a significant step up there. But in addition to that, we also saw a reduction in cancellation requests. In fact, they weren't significant at all. And you'll recall in prior quarters, we have been trying to ensure that we improve the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio, in other words, the visibility to our customers' ordering patterns by allowing for these cancellations. And it's a signal to the positive that those cancellations are no longer significant. Now as it relates to the inventory destocking, for us, we believe that we'll largely be behind -- have the destocking behind us here at the end of the second quarter. And what's driving that really are in North America and in Europe, the large pharma and CDMO customers who are increasingly returning to their normal ordering patterns. And that's encouraging because we're starting to get that regular order traffic. And those customers are clearly with that signaling that they have come into an inventory equilibrium. And that supports our hypothesis there. Now as we think about the Biotech segment, which represents about 10% to 15% of our business in bioprocessing. We have seen the improvement of the funding levels. And they're just above, I would say, the 2019 levels now after the peak between the two years here. And that's also an encouraging signal, but it's a little too early to see that have an effect right now in order rates. It typically takes two, three quarters before we start seeing that improved funding level play out in actual orders. And lastly, I would say China, China remains as we have forecast at a low activity level and is not really contributing from a tail or headwind. It is as we have projected and guided with a relatively low level of activity.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. That's all really helpful context. I think one of the things we've noticed in the last couple quarters, last year, is that between yourselves and Sartorius and Merck KGaA and Avantor and Repligen and Thermo, everyone's got slightly different book to bills. Everyone got slightly different order trends, seasonality, pacing. How would you characterize high level, where your portfolio stacks up versus the others? And what should we keep in mind when we're making those read-throughs from company to company?
Rainer Blair: So, there's a couple things to consider when comparing companies. First of all, everybody has slight differences in how they calculate a book-to-bill. So that's sort of one point. The second point would be that there are differences in the portfolios. For instance, at Danaher, we have the broadest and deepest portfolio in bioprocessing. And as you think about our product mix, that will be different than any given other player. And then the geographic and customer mix is also different. So that will lead to different patterns in the recovery. But I would say the large picture, if we take a step back, is actually fairly consistent. It appears that the industry is seeing a slow and gradual recovery here through the first half of the year with an expectation that things get better here in the second half, certainly off of the basis of easier comps, but also because we have largely put the destocking issue behind us.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. And most of those comments, I think, really touch on the short term. But can we think about bioprocessing longer term? I think as you exit this year, you talked about mid single digit, high single digit growth or better. That sets you up well for 2025. So, when we think about the long-term bioprocess algorithm, what's your latest view on underlying market demand and just sort of how sustainable is that growth?
Rainer Blair: That's right, Michael. So, we are saying that in the second half in bioprocessing, we'll see mid to high single digits with an exit rate of high single digits or better. And that supports our long-term thesis that the bioprocessing market really is growing at high single digits. And that's our expectation here for the long-term. 2025 is a ways away for us yet. We want to make sure that we deliver what we have to do in 2024. But our long-term hypothesis remains intact. And that's really based on a number of supporting factors. If we think about the lower penetration, relatively speaking, of biologic drugs around the world and the opportunity to reach more patients with different approaches such as biosimilars. If we think about the size and the speed of development in the development funnel with the various types of modalities, certainly monoclonal antibodies, but also different proteins such as ADCs, bispecifics, and then, of course, nucleic acids as they make their way into the therapeutic arsenal for clinicians. So, all of that we view as very positive and supportive of our long-term hypothesis.
Michael Ryskin: And you don't think -- just to be clear, you don't think there's been any change in competitive dynamics over the last year in terms of market share, market gains and losses. You don't think there's really any new entrants that have popped up in the space. When we go into 2025, it will still be relatively similar market to what it was pre-inventory glut.
Rainer Blair: By and large, there have been small share shifts. We believe that we're a beneficiary of those. Of course, there are always new entrants with new ideas and innovations at the margin. But if we view the large picture here, essentially the industry structure and hypothesis remains intact and we view ourselves as a determinant player in that industry.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe shifting away from bioprocess specifically, let's talk about the biopharma end market. You touched briefly on biotech funding and emerging biotech and sort of early funding levels in 1Q and how that will play out. Let's talk about large pharma. I think broadly the comments were that 1Q was a little bit slow out of the gate. Could you expand on that a little bit in terms of budget releases and how have things trended in terms of conversations through March and April?
Rainer Blair: So, large pharma for us actually was not slow out of the gate here in the first quarter. In fact, as we look at prescription rates here from 2018 forward, we continue to see in biologics a growth rate of 9%, 10%. And that is sustained here. And we actually believe a net of any inventory correction that we're starting to see that demand signal, more of it certainly in the first quarter. And we would expect to see more of it as we go through the year. So, there are a number of things that are going on in big pharma. But what one has to see as the key takeaway is that the pace of innovation in large pharma has never been faster. The investments and the bets that are being made have never been larger or more exciting. And all of that speaks well not only to what clinicians will have to treat patients around the world, but for the industry's health as a whole. So, we're very bullish on the long-term future here and how large pharma plays out in the long-term.
Michael Ryskin: What about factors like IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act? I mean, that's been a hotly debated topic for the past year. Are you seeing any changes tied to that? I know it's still years away.
Rainer Blair: Well, it's a little early for there to be an impact. But as we tease apart the different elements that are applicable to us, I think the first thing to note is that biologic drugs versus small molecule drugs are treated differently in the IRA. Biologic drugs receive protection, relatively speaking, for 12 years and small molecules for five years. And so, as you think that through, while that's perhaps shorter than it has been, it actually advantages the development of biologic drugs going forward as they would have longer protection. Secondly, should the pricing of these drugs be lower through Medicare or other programs? The expectation would be that the volume of the prescription and the consumption of those drugs to patients who need them would increase. And of course, our business is volume-driven. So, as the production of these drugs increases in volume, whether as a result of the IRA or whether because a biosimilar has been launched, that's a net positive for the tools industry and of course, as we're the largest player in bioprocessing, certainly for us as well.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. That's helpful. And then, sort of sticking on pharma, but maybe expanding things a little bit, let's talk about instrumentation. It's a small part of your business. It's not the biggest needle mover, but still instrumentation was a little bit challenged in the quarter. Again, you saw relatively similar commentary from some of your peers. How should we think about instruments recovering or progressing as you go through the year?
Rainer Blair: So, what we've seen in the instrument business, and recall our instrument business is about 10% of our total business. So, as you suggested, it's not our largest segment. But nonetheless, what we have seen here, and we've called it out some time ago, is really a normalization process of an industry which is typically a mid single digit growing industry. And what we've seen in the past through subsidies, whether they be in China or by other countries in various different forms, is the pull forward of demand. And what we're seeing now is really the overhang of that pull forward as this industry normalizes. We would say this is still in the earlier stages of that normalization process, but expect to start seeing improvements in the second half, not only because of better or easier comps, but also because we would expect the activity level to return here as pharma companies and other researchers and applied markets start replacing their installed base and getting back to a normal rhythm.
Michael Ryskin: And are you seeing any difference across your portfolio? You've got exposure there from Leica, from Beckman, from Sciex. Any parts of the business doing a little bit better than others? And sort of what differentiates that?
Rainer Blair: I would say what we see, and this is to be seen as a nuance as opposed to a large trend, is that the larger scientific instruments that are really about pushing scientific inquiry forward at the leading edge of science are doing better than those that are more the traditional lab workhorses where there's still, I would say, some opportunity for improved growth going forward. But we're not there yet.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Next, I want to run through a couple specific business segments. Let's start with Cepheid. Business did really well in 1Q, but then again, it's done very, very well for a number of quarters in a row. It's been a number of years since you closed that deal. If you could just sort of take a step back and evaluate where Cepheid was when you brought it in versus what it is now. What really has driven that outperformance?
Rainer Blair: This is an acquisition, certainly for the history books. We're working every day, of course, to put others in there. And there's a couple other examples. But Cepheid truly is an extraordinary example of that. And really, the acquisition was about acquiring an outstanding team, first and foremost, that had developed a differentiated technology that is defensible and that delivers, first and foremost, real clinical value. The secret sauce of Cepheid's success is tied directly to the value it offers to clinicians to help their patients. And so, of course, as Cepheid entered Danaher, we helped Cepheid to become more profitable and with that profitability to be able to reinvest more in the business. And with that, we're then able to fully take advantage of the pandemic with our installed base now post-pandemic being more than two and a half times the size it was prior to the pandemic. We've invested significantly in R&D and the assay development flywheel that we drive there and that has us now with 30-plus approved assays in the U.S., with 40-plus approved assays outside of the U.S. And those are delivering differentiated value in various care settings. At the point-of-care, where doctors are making calls about therapeutics. I was asked just the other day about the 4-in-1 test and why it is such a popular respiratory test solution. And you'll recall the 4-in-1 is for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, and COVID. And the reason is that when a patient presents with flu-like symptoms, it's really a crapshoot as to what this patient has. And ultimately, with the 4-in-1 test, the doctor is not only able to identify what it is not, it specifically identifies what the ailment is and allows a therapeutic decision. And this is done with ease-of-use. This is done at a short turnaround time and its high performance, meaning it's the right answer. And that combination has really been attractive to hospital systems and clinicians throughout the world and really defines how Cepheid continues to move forward and take share.
Michael Ryskin: So, with all that being said, where does Cepheid go next? You talked about the massive growth in the install base. You talked about the menu expansion. Margins have really taken a huge leap forward. So, what's your view of Cepheid over the next couple of years?
Rainer Blair: We're going to continue to take share. There's plenty of opportunity for share gain, not just in respiratory testing. On the contrary, we have many more tests available. So, we continue with ensuring that the utilization of more menu assays per instrument, as well as introducing additional assays. And then, of course, we still have the opportunity of geographic expansion. So, we're going to continue to invest in the right clinical decision-making for the hospital systems and doctors out there by providing them this outstanding solution.
Michael Ryskin: So, net-net, above company growth, margin accretive at this point, right?
Rainer Blair: So, we think the long-term growth rate of the non-respiratory business is in the low double-digits. That is above the fleet's growth rate, which we believe to be high single digits. And this is a very profitable business at scale and will contribute and be accretive to the fleet average.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. A couple of other assets I want to touch on real quick. Aldevron, you acquired that asset a couple of years ago. When you acquired it, I believe $400 million in revenue, growing healthy, healthy double-digits, very strong margins, really positioned you for nucleic acids, cell and gene therapy, some of the new modalities, so affiliated with bioprocessing. Could you give us an update on that deal, how that's fared since the acquisition post?
Rainer Blair: So, first, when we acquired it, it was more like $250 million in revenues. But nonetheless, it has continued to grow at very attractive growth rates here and is meeting our expectations. As you would expect, there's a bit of a tail post-COVID here for Aldevron as they were involved in the manufacture of various solutions here used during the pandemic. But nonetheless, they are the gold standard as it relates to supplying plasmids and other types of proteins to the gene editing market. And that, of course, is a very interesting market, not just today, but for the very long-term. And that was the principal reason for us making that acquisition to ensure that we not only had a beachhead, but a gold standard for the development of gene editing solutions going forward.
Michael Ryskin: And then your most recent acquisition was Abcam, just closed in December. So, you've had it for a total of maybe five months now, but you've already taken some early steps in terms of integrating that and sort of taking it down the road of becoming a Danaher OpCo. So, give us an update on how that deal is going.
Rainer Blair: So, early days. We closed in December as you mentioned, and we just also closed on our first quarter with ownership there. We've installed a Danaher President and CFO so that they start playing out the playbook that we put together here during diligence, which is specifically tailored to Abcam and the opportunities there to both accelerate growth and improve the cost position. So, it's early days, but we believe certainly that this really another gold standard company that is really the standard in proteomic research reagents is going to meet its high single digit long-term growth rate.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. All right. And where I'm going with these questions is, Cepheid, Aldevron, Abcam, we kind of talked about Cytiva when we talked about bioprocessing. You take all these together and Danaher exiting COVID, exiting 2024 is going to look like a very, very different company than it looked like in 2016, '17, '18. The last couple of years between COVID and inventory stocking, it's really obscured the underlying performance of the company. So, taking all of that together, how would you characterize, what are we going to be looking at in the next couple of years going forward in terms of the new, new Danaher?
Rainer Blair: You're right. The fog of the pandemic has obscured the true power and the rerating of both our growth and earnings trajectory post-pandemic. And just to give you a sense of the power of this transformation, if we just sort of take 2018 as a base year prior to the pandemic, and we look to the end of 2023, we're a $20 billion company that was a mid single digit grower with low 20s operating margins. And since then, we have spun off in different forms over $7 billion of our revenue and nearly replaced it through other acquisitions. What we spun off Envista as well as Veralto, which was just in last October had dilutive growth and earnings profiles. And what we acquired had accretive growth and earnings profiles. And of course, our acquisitions were the GE biopharma business, which we've since combined with the Pall Life Sciences business to form Cytiva. And you all know that as being the premier franchise in bioprocessing in the world, we acquired Aldevron and Abcam both once again accretive to both growth and earnings. And those each gave us a beachhead in genomic medicines as well as proteomic research. And then lastly, if you think about how the respiratory testing market has developed back in 2018, roughly we were a $250 million respiratory testing business. And if you think about where we are today in an endemic state, we're well over a $1 billion. We've talked about $1.6 billion here in the guide for 2024. And we believe that to be a sustainable level of respiratory testing. So, when you put all that together, you're looking at a $24 billion business that is dialed into the most attractive segments in the life science industry with a high single digit long-term growth rate, a margin profile, so VCM of 35% to 40%. You all are familiar with our operating system, the Danaher Business System. That allows us to drive cash flow above our net income. And all of that, of course, then allows us to execute on M&A and capital allocation in general. And that's what ultimately drives that earnings accretion of double-digit EPS growth. So, when you see all of this, you can see that our objective to exit the pandemic stronger than entering it, we believe that's been achieved. And as the fog continues to rise here and the pandemic gets further and further into the rearview mirror, you're going to start seeing that portfolio play itself out.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. You just touched on it there in terms of the earnings accretion and the operating leverage, but I want to touch on that a little bit more. Given the business shift, given where you're seeing the fastest growth opportunities in Cepheid and bioprocess, those are really accretive incremental margins. You've got really high-volume leverage. So, as the business recovers exiting this year, as you look forward to 2025, how should we think about that incremental flow through to the bottom line?
Rainer Blair: So that flow through, of course, as we've been contracting, was very high on the negative side, but you can expect that we've done a lot of work on the cost side during the pandemic. We have not sat idly by here and we've taken full advantage of this time to continue to drive our fixed cost base down to be able to benefit from the volume leverage, which we expect over time. So that's going to be a very attractive incremental flow through as volumes recover going forward.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Just a couple minutes left, so I want to make sure we touch on capital deployment at M&A. As you said, you just did Abcam last year, but given your free cash flow, given your balance sheet, you could probably do an Abcam sized deal every year, if not more. So, your balance sheet remains really robust, free cash flow strong. There's a lot of opportunities out there. So, how would you characterize your appetite for M&A now or for other capital deployment?
Rainer Blair: Well, we are skewed in our thinking. We have a bias, if you will, towards M&A with our cash flow and that remains unchanged. But we do have to say that the current environment with high interest rates and high valuations are such that it makes it, of course, more difficult. The one thing that we're not going to compromise is our discipline around return expectations on acquisitions. And what that likely means in the shorter term is that we're more likely to do smaller bolt-ons and medium sized deals, which for a company of our size, $25 billion roughly revenue, continues and will continue to move the needle. So, to give you a sense, you used Abcam as an example that adds 2% to our growth in one year. And of course, if we hadn't done the spins of past and we were much larger, say nearly double, of course, that would be only half that growth rate and it becomes much harder to move the needle. So lastly, to the topic of other forms of capital allocation, we always look at all types of capital allocation. And we do that, of course, in relation to the alternatives that we have and on the basis of return on invested capital. So, we have a bias towards M&A, but of course, we always see what other alternatives we might have in capital allocation.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. And talking about the M&A angle, could you talk us through your framework in terms of how you consider targets? What's the roadmap you take when you're evaluating something?
Rainer Blair: So, this is the way we operate. First of all, we get out of bed in the morning and are canvassing markets essentially 24x7 with our teams to understand markets and to understand companies. And it's on the basis of our strategy, which is to apply science and technology to improve human health, that we set a frame and then look for those markets that have the most attractive long-term secular growth drivers. We're not talking about three years. We're not talking about five years. We're talking about 10-plus years of strong secular growth that supports an investment hypothesis. Then within that, we, of course, look for the most attractive targets. And in that case, we try to develop a proprietary perspective on any given asset to see whether it has a competitive advantage, value, reserves that we might mine or that we can expand, leveraging our experience in the Danaher Business System in order to improve that asset. And then, of course, in parallel to that, the financial model has to work. We will not compromise on our earnings metrics and return on invested capital and our cash flow expectations.
Michael Ryskin: Great. I think if you if you frame it that way, you think back between Cytiva, Cepheid, Abcam and Aldevron, they all check the box in terms of long-term secular growth, company-specific advantage, valuation. So, it's a clear way of thinking about it. We got about a minute left. So, just sort of our last concluding question is the standard. Danaher has pretty well understood and pretty well followed, but is there anything that you think is still underappreciated? Is there anything that people misunderstand or misinterpret? Sort of what are the questions you're getting that you want to clarify?
Rainer Blair: I would just say it comes back to this fog lifting. We have done a -- I believe, a tremendous amount of work to transform our portfolio and position this company with a competitive advantage, not just in terms of the kinds of companies that we have and the technologies that we use to innovate within any given segment, but also with the Danaher Business System and our teams. We just believe that this is a really unique company. The combination of those markets that we operate in, the lighthouse, leading assets that we own in those markets, the tried and true Danaher Business System, which allows us to execute at scale for nearly 40 years now, nearly 40 years now. This is -- that's unique. It's our culture along with the tool set on how we operate and drive improved performance. And then lastly, I believe we bring a discipline to the market with how we operate that is truly differentiated and it shows in our cash flow. If you compare our cash flow to other companies in the sector or elsewhere, it truly does identify where the real power and multiplier is of the Danaher Business System and our portfolio.
End of Q&A:
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much. And with that, we're out of time.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Mike.
Michael Ryskin: Rainer, appreciate it.
Rainer Blair: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Michael Ryskin: Thank you, everyone.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, everybody.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Todd and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the investors section of our website www.danaher.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until February 13, 2024. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We delivered better than anticipated core revenue in each of our segments in the fourth quarter led by respiratory revenue at Cepheid. The combination of higher than expected revenues and our team's strong execution enabled us to exceed our margin and cash flow expectations in what remains a dynamic market environment. Now before I get into the details of our performance, I wanted to briefly reflect on the progress we made to enhance our portfolio and accelerate our strategy this year. 2023 was a transformational year for Danaher as we continued to strategically enhance our portfolio and strengthen our growth and earnings trajectory. With the successful spin-off of Veralto in September, we're now a focused Life Sciences and Diagnostics Innovator. Establishing Veralto as a standalone public company was one step in our portfolio transformation over the last several years, which has increased our exposure to end markets with durable secular growth drivers. The acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December, further increases our exposure to these highly attractive markets. Now over the long term, we believe Danaher will be a faster growing business with higher margins and stronger free cash flow generation. 2023 was also a challenging year operationally as pandemic tailwinds became headwinds in our businesses. Our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System helped us navigate these challenges while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments and productivity initiatives geared towards improving our cost structure. While we expect this transitional period to continue through the first half of 2024, these proactive steps paired with the transformation in our portfolio provide a strong foundation for sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full-year 2023 financial results. Sales were at $23.9 billion and core revenue declined 10%, including core revenue in our base business which was down slightly and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 28.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.58. We also generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 120%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher and 2023 marks the 32nd consecutive year our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100%. We continued to accelerate investments in innovation throughout the year, which enabled us to deliver several impactful new technologies to our customers. In Biotechnology, Cytiva's new Xcellerex X-platform bioreactor is helping improve manufacturing yields and reduce the time and cost of biologic drug production. In Life Sciences, new products such as IDBS' Polar Insight and Molecular Devices' CellXpress.ai are helping accelerate the drug discovery process and bring life-changing therapies to market faster. And in Diagnostics, new solutions such as Beckman Coulter's DxI 9000 next generation immunoassay analyzer are enabling faster, more accurate patient diagnosis. These are just a few of the many examples across Danaher of how we're positioning our businesses for continued growth and delivering on our commitment to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 4.5% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 7%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits driven by lower respiratory and COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenues coupled with ongoing investment normalization in pharma and biopharma end markets. High growth markets were down high single digits including a mid-teens decline in China where the economic landscape remains challenging. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%. Our adjusted operating margin of 28.7% was down 420 basis points primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments and costs related to productivity initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.09 and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 21% and core revenue was down 22.5%. Bioprocessing core revenue was down over 20% as anticipated and discovery and medical declined high teens. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue declined high teens in the fourth quarter and was down approximately 10% for the full-year 2023. Revenue and order trends were largely consistent with what we saw in the third quarter including our book-to-bill ratio. We were encouraged to see a modest sequential improvement in orders this quarter with some of our customers returning to normal ordering patterns, but we haven't yet seen a broad-based inflection in demand. The environment in North America and Europe is stable with customers still working through inventory built up during the pandemic. Demand and underlying activity levels in China remain weak as customers are continuing to conserve capital and prioritize programs. For the full-year 2024, we expect core revenue in our Bioprocessing business to be down low single digits. This includes an assumption of a mid to high teens revenue decline in the first half of the year followed by a gradual improvement to a core growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit 2024. Despite the near-term headwinds from destocking, our confidence in the health and long-term growth trajectory of the biologics market remains as strong as ever. Underlying demand for biologic medicines continues to rise. 2023 was another record year of FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines and the development pipeline is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. These positive market trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead and the high single-digit long-term growth trajectory for our leading bioprocessing franchise. Over the last several years, Cytiva has been accelerating investments in innovation to bring impactful new solutions to customers as they advance therapies from the lab through to commercial production. A great example is the recently launched Cytiva protein select technology, an affinity chromatography resin designed to optimize recombinant protein purification. This new technology simplifies the purification process in recombinant proteins, of which there are currently more than 1,800 in development, and enables faster and more efficient process development. Turning to our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue declined 1% and core revenue was down 4% including a low single-digit decline in our base business. Our life sciences instruments business collectively declined mid-single digits with trends in the fourth quarter largely consistent with the third quarter. We saw continued growth from academic and life science research customers globally while investment levels at pharma and biopharma customers remain constrained, particularly in China and in North America. We also expanded our capabilities and portfolio with the acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December 2023. The addition of Abcam to our Life Sciences segment expands our presence in the highly attractive proteomics market and is furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We couldn't be more pleased to welcome this highly talented and incredibly innovative team to Danaher. Our genomics consumables base business was essentially flat in the quarter. Robust demand across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions was offset by decline in next generation sequencing and basic research. During the quarter, IDT opened a new cGMP oligonucleotide manufacturing facility at their Coralville, Iowa campus. IDT can now offer a complete CRISPR workflow from design to analysis that supports cell and gene therapy customers in all stages of therapeutic development. This expansion of our capacity and capabilities is both enabling our customers important work today and fulfilling IDT's vision of improving patient lives by facilitating faster development and commercialization of life changing therapeutics. Moving now to our Diagnostics segment. Reported and core revenue both declined 8.5% with high single-digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower respiratory revenue at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics led the way with over 10% core revenue growth, including double-digit growth in both instruments and consumables and notable strength in clinical, chemistry, and immunoassay. This strong performance in the fourth quarter rounds out a terrific year for Beckman where the team has been doing a fantastic job improving their competitive positioning through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. In molecular diagnostics at Cepheid, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive low teens core revenue growth in our non-respiratory business, including high teens or better core revenue growth in Group A Strep and sexual health. In our respiratory business, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $650 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million. The high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses drove both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. Based on what we saw the last two years and discussions with customers and public health experts, we believe annual respiratory revenue in a typical respiratory season will be approximately $1.5 billion. This increase from our initial assumption of $1.2 billion per year is driven by an expectation of modestly higher volumes and a greater mix of our 4-in-1 tests. The durability and continued share gains at Cepheid are a testament to the significant value that Gene-Xpert provides customers at the point-of-care, close to patients where the most impactful diagnostic and treatment decisions are made. Cepheid's 4-in-1 test has become the standard of care for clinicians given its ability to provide a fast accurate lab quality diagnosis for four distinct respiratory illnesses with a single easy-to-use cartridge. Looking ahead with our differentiated positioning and respiratory testing, a leading installed base of more than 55,000 systems, and with growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market; Cepheid is well-positioned to help customers meet their clinical needs and continue gaining market share. Now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the first quarter and the full-year 2024. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we will provide guidance for core revenue growth, but will no longer report base business core revenue as the pandemic has transitioned to an endemic state. Now in the first quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating margin of approximately 28%. Turning to the full-year 2024. We anticipate core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range, which assumes a core revenue decline in the first half of the year before returning to growth in the second half of 2024. Additionally, we expect our full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus the full-year 2023. So to wrap up, we're pleased to deliver fourth quarter results ahead of our expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. Despite the challenges we saw throughout 2023, we continued to strengthen our portfolio with M&A and took proactive steps focused on improving our cost structure. Our team's consistent application of the Danaher Business System also drove lasting process improvements in our businesses and enabled the launch of several breakthrough solutions. Reflecting back on the past few years, it's clear that Danaher is exiting the pandemic a much better stronger company. We established our dental and environmental and applied solutions segments as standalone public companies in Invista and Veralto. We largely replaced their revenue contribution with higher growth, higher margin annuities with the acquisitions of Factiva, Aldevron, and Abcam. Additionally, Cepheid's respiratory franchise is now six times larger today than it was prior to the pandemic and we expect this to be sustainable. So putting it all together, we've improved our long-term growth trajectory, significantly expanded margins, and strengthened our free cash flow generation. So, our future is bright and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. The unique combination of our incredibly talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality all powered by the Danaher Business System provides us with a strong foundation to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Rainer, maybe starting off just on bioprocess. Could you give us a little breakdown here in terms of the outlook that you're providing say for China and then rest of world? And then I was hoping as well you can give us a snapshot maybe of how much inventory do you think your customers have today and how much of that changed versus the peak and kind of what does your guidance assume kind of when that inventory reaches a normal state?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan. Good morning. And why don't I start off with sort of an overview here on how we've laid out the guide and then we can dig into your bioprocessing question in a little more detail. So, our guide for the full year of 2024 on revenue is down low single digits and now let me break that open and talk about the segments. Biotechnology will be down low to mid-single digits and that's different than bioprocessing. So, keep in mind I'm not talking about the Biotechnology segment in its entirety. The guide is down low to mid-single digits. Life Sciences down low single digits and Diagnostics up low single digits. And once again overall, that's then down low single digits. Now at a high level, we actually expect the dynamic to be opposite of 2023 with a slow first half returning to growth in the second half. And now let me talk just a little bit about the assumptions around our guidance. Starting with bioprocessing, which we're guiding to be down low single digits and we think the first half will look a lot like second half of 2023 down mid to high teens coming off of a fourth quarter which showed incrementally improved orders versus Q3. Second half we expect to return to mid to high single-digit growth and we believe by then that the destocking in North America and Western Europe will have largely been completed and of course the comps ease there as well. So importantly for bioprocessing, we think exit rate for the year will be high single digits or better core growth. Now if we look at Life Sciences, we expect Life Sciences to be down low single digits for the guide and we expect a slow start and we should see growth improve here through the second half given some of the comps that we have seen as the normalization, particularly in the instrument business, continues and we've been talking about that for some time and we expect that to continue into 2024 as well. Now if we look at that by end market and see pharma and biotech, stable but at lower levels of demand; and then academic and applied markets holding up comparatively better. Geographically, we see China weak with a slower macro and of course in Life Sciences in particular, we have some prior year comps related to the subsidized loan program there. And then lastly on Life Sciences, we expect developed markets to be relatively consistent with 2023. As we look at Diagnostics, which we are guiding up low single digits, we see no change to the underlying trends, patient volumes have normalized. And in the non-respiratory business, we expect growth of mid-single digits and of course that's offset by lower respiratory revenue, which was $1.9 billion in 2023 and we anticipate that that will be $1.6 billion in 2024. So Dan, that's how the year shapes up by segment and of course then we can now perhaps talk a little bit more detail around bioprocessing.
Matt McGrew: Dan, maybe to just kind of to put some numbers around your question as well. So I think China for the year for bioprocessing, you should probably think about the first quarter being down similar to what we saw in Q2, Q3, and Q4 last year call it north of 40%. And then I think for the full year, I just think even that will still be down kind of mid-teens for bioprocessing in China. That's sort of what we've got dialed in. And as far as the rest of the world, I think we'll be down in the first half and then kind of return to growth here in the second half after we get past the destocking. And I know you asked how much kind of inventory is in China. It's kind of hard to say, Dan. I mean we've got a kind of a moving target, but we've got a good sense that what we will largely be through most of the destocking, particularly in North America and Europe where it was probably the biggest. I think we're going to be through that here in the first half, which then sort of speaks to why we think it gets a little bit better in the second half of the year.
Dan Brennan: Got it. Thanks, guys. And then maybe a follow-up just on bioprocessing. That's such a huge focus. Just in terms of the guide that you've laid out, what does that assume from kind of a book-to-bill or bookings trajectory as we work through the year? And just kind of related to that, several peers have already pointed to book-to-bills kind of above one. Obviously, everyone's order books are, mix of business is different. But what's kind of unique about your business, do you think? Is it clinical versus commercial, or is it just the size of your book or just any color? Why do you think some of the peers have seen the turn in their business faster than what you guys have seen? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Yes, let me give you a little bit of color on how I'm thinking about the guide or how we're thinking about the guide. Maybe start with - this is for bioprocessing. Start with kind of a qualitative overview of what this guide sort of is, right? This guide calls for a slight improvement versus our demonstrated book-to-bill of the last couple quarters. We've been in that kind of 0.8, 0.85 range the last four or five quarters. And we are not calling for an inflection at any point in the year, but we are assuming some modest improvement as we move through the first half into the second half. Like I said before, as we think that North America and Europe destocking is largely behind us after the first half. So, no inflection, sort of just kind of gets a little bit better than where we were. As far as kind of some numbers around that, Dan, maybe start with the backlog. So, we're starting with about a quarter and a half of backlog. That's pretty consistent with where we were in 2018, 2019. So, I think we're back to backlog levels that are, relatively speaking, pretty much in line with history. And then you start with that backlog and add this book-to-bill assumption in there. We are assuming book-to-bills improve slightly, like I said, kind of from the 0.8, 0.85s into the 0.9s. And that those will get a little bit better every quarter, as we build through the year. But we are not assuming book-to-bills go above one in any given quarter. And so that kind of assumes that, we get past the inventory destocking in the first half. The second half gets a little bit better. And that we're kind of exiting here, like I said, the first half will be down mid-teens. Mid-to-high teens for the second half we exit with high single-digits or better without seeing an inflection. And I think maybe, I know that there's been some questions on that second half ramp as well. Maybe just to give people some quantitative numbers on that. So the second half ramp in bioprocess assumed in this guide is about a $250 million year-over-year second half increase. So that's on a, call it a $6.5 billion business. So yes, there is a step up. But I think it's relatively modest on a business with $6 billion to expect that we think we could do a couple hundred million dollars better year-over-year in the second half as we move past the destocking. So hopefully that helps frame the guide a little.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, Rainer. And thanks for taking my question. So I guess I'll start off with those last comments from Matt. The Q1 guidance here, Rainer, on biotech and bioprocess being down in low 20s, I guess we did see sequential order improvements in Q4 for bioprocess. What is driving, and comps to get easier for you for Q4 to Q1 on biotech comps to get easier. So what is driving the minus 20% maybe thought process around the Q1 guidance assumptions? And also have you - I know there was a no-fee cancellation policy. Has that stopped for Danaher?
Matt McGrew: Yes, Vijay, it's Matt. Maybe I'll take a first stab at it. So, if we think about kind of the first half here, I think it's probably instructive to sort of remember where we were. If you remember, our base business core growth in Q1 last year was actually up low single-digits. And for the first half of 2023, we were only down kind of low to mid-single-digits in total, right? The second half, we were down mid-teens or high-teens, as everybody remembers. But we do have that comp coming in the first quarter. And so, when you think about year-over-year, that's really the biggest factor. As far as sequential goes, kind of Q4 to Q1, I would tell you that we would, you know, I think we talked about this in January. Our Q3 to Q4 sequential, that's pretty normal. That's a normal Q3 to Q4 step up. I think we attributed that to a normal seasonality when we were out at JPMorgan. And it's very also normal to see Q4 to Q1 step down. So, just maybe some numbers to that. Q4 is usually 27%, 28% of our year, and Q1 is usually 24% and 25% of revenue for the year. So, I mean, it's pretty normal for us to see it. I think we saw it even, in kind of a heyday of '21 to '22, we saw it step down. So, I think there's a normal seasonality. And I think the other big thing to remember is, and it kind of ties into your last question there, Vijay. We are actively trying to continue to destock and get as much of this behind us as we can. And so I think, we've been pretty aggressive with that. We're going to remain aggressive with that. I think you're seeing that hopefully, here in the first half that we are. And back to your kind of no-fees question, it depends is the answer. But rest assured, we are doing what we can to get to the second half of the year.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. And I guess my follow-up here, Rainer, is when you look at customer activity levels or consumption, if you will, what's been the underlying activity at customer levels, when we think about drug volumes being up high singles in that space, is that still intact? And sort of, I guess, one on diagnostics, if you will, last year you guys did base diagnostics up double-digits. And I think you mentioned mid-singles for this year. So is that just a comp issue? Why diagnostics would slow down?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay. Well, starting with the activity level here for bioprocessing. We've really seen no change in the activity level, which continues to be along the long-term growth rate that we've been talking about, high single-digits, 10%. And that's what's been important in terms of drawing the inventories down. So and it aligns with how we spoke about the regional developments here. Which Western Europe and North America are drawing down inventories more rapidly than perhaps regions that are more, small biotech, emerging biotech companies such as China. So, the activity level continues to be strong. I mentioned to you during the prepared remarks that we've seen a historic level of both approvals as well as number of projects in the biologic development pipeline. So, we continue to be very confident in a - continued positive development there.
Vijay Kumar: Thank you. And sorry, on diagnostics, Rainer?
Rainer Blair: Yes Vijay, I mean, I think it's just - it's all going to be mostly a comp issue. The base business, the business outside of, I should say, respiratory continues to do well for Cepheid. All of the other businesses in diagnostics, no real change, to the underlying demand. So it's going to be a comp issue.
Vijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.
Rainer Blair: All of diagnostics, yes.
Vijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hi good morning, guys. Good morning, Rainer, Matt and John. Guys, can you help us, when volumes are kind of still moving negative in the first half of the year, it's hard to get your arms around kind of what you've done to the cost structure with the 50 basis point guide up. Is there anything we can look at, any KPIs you can share around, like, headcount reductions or rooftops or anything that you guys have kind of tangibly done internally on costs that, you can share that helps us understand, perhaps what that impact on margins will be and not just '24, but going forward? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yes. Yes I mean, maybe the way to think about the OP kind of at a high level Scott, is we ended 2023 with an adjusted operating margin of call of, almost approximately 28.5%, and we think, like you said, it's going to be up 50 bps here in the year. We had $350 million of sort of one-time costs last year, some of that, if I think about what that was and the metrics around it, I would tell you that there's a lot of heads that did come out. And largely that was reflective of the lower volumes that we saw last year, particularly at Cepheid as we went from 70 million tests down to 35 million. We sort of knew there would come a day when we were going to need to pull back some of that capacity, and largely last year we did that. I think you also saw it at some of the other businesses in the second half as well in life sciences and some others that have seen a little bit more difficult growth profiles. I think largely it is heads. There are some rooftops here and there, but I think it's more trying to get after the cost structure to right-size it, for what's going to be a difficult first half, so that we're in a good spot. So, that $350 million of benefit that, would have been about 150 basis points on its own, Scott. But we do have the lower volumes, as you mentioned, in bioprocessing, respiratory, and that basically offset all of it. And so really the cost savings, if you will, from that $350 million that we deployed, is what we're getting and flowing through as the 50 bps of margin expansion. So that should be pretty durable as we go. And hopefully, with a little bit better volume here, and the gross and adjusted operating margins, we have, a little bit of volume is going to go a long way.
Scott Davis: Got it. I would imagine so. Guys, can you help us understand China? I understand that, I guess consistent with last quarter and the guide and such, still pretty conservative. How do you kind of separate the cyclical versus kind of, what I'll call the secular, which is perhaps maybe government policy and other impacts are out there? I haven't been to China in a while, so perhaps maybe you guys can help us understand the puts and takes there, and is that market still attractive long-term, or has there been some sort of change at the margin there that perhaps makes it less interesting? I'll just kind of open it up to that. It's a lot of white space, if you will? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Sure. Scott China, let me start with this. We continue to believe China is an attractive market in the long-term that is going to be accretive to our overall growth, and the reason for that is that the Chinese government and frankly, the Chinese people are prioritizing, among very few priorities, they're prioritizing healthcare. More broadly, but also more specifically in terms of building their own pharmaceutical industry. With both generic and innovative and biosimilar type drugs. And that process, while it has taken a pause here, or certainly slowed as the funding environment has become more difficult in the short-term, we expect that process to work itself out here in the midterm. Now, for China this year, as it relates to our guide, we're assuming that China will be down high single-digits. Yes, because of the challenging macro. We actually expect that macro to be more challenging than perhaps even what we see in the healthcare market, but we're not planning in that guide, a stimulus from the Chinese government, but more of the same and then of course, the reversing of tough comps here in the second half. So it's going to be a tougher start to the year, as the activity level essentially remains where it has been here in the second half of 2023. Particularly in biotechnology and life sciences, and then as we get through those tougher comps in the first half, we'll see the second half where we're not assuming significantly higher activity levels, but we do see the math then working in our favor. Longer term, we believe the pull and the requirement in China for these innovative and highly effective drugs is intact and that the investment will continue.
Scott Davis: Very helpful. Best of luck in 2024, guys. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Hi, Rainer. Hi Matt. I want to follow-up on a couple of your comments from earlier in the Q&A just on bioprocessing to make sure I got it right. I mean first, I think you called out that, you don't expect a book-to-bill above one at any point during the year. So, I mean, that means you'll be continuing to deplete the backlog all year, but you already cited that the backlog, is sort of at a normal level with 1.5 quarters. So, I'm just wondering, how low is that going to get over the course of the year then if your book-to-bill doesn't break one? And then sort of related to that, if you've only gotten one to two quarters of backlog and yet you're calling for this gradual improvement as the year goes on, high single-digit growth rate, just sort of like what underpins that improvement from what you do see in 1Q, 2Q to start the year?
Matt McGrew: Yes, I mean, I think the way we talked about the guide, I mean, I did say that it doesn't go over one, but it gets pretty close in the second half. I mean, if you do the math, it does get pretty close to one. So I think, it is still a little bit early to call what we're going to see in '25, but I think you're right. We are calling for gradual improvements in the book-to-bill through the year, and it will get pretty close to one, but not over one in the second half. That's kind of how we're thinking about it. And as far as the growth rate, first half to second half, I think was your question, is that right, Mike I want to make sure?
Michael Ryskin: Yes, just visibility, not improvement?
Matt McGrew: Yes well, I mean, like I said, it's not a huge number, right? First half to second half, you're talking about $250 million. So we are, I think the visibility, is improving a little bit here as we move into the year, and we expect that it will continue to do so, as we move past the inventory destocking in the first half. And so I think, with the assumption of a ramp, admittedly, but only on - only of a couple hundred million dollars. I just feel like, if we can get past the destocking, be aggressive with that, having a second half ramp that is, $250 million on $6 billion, it's not that steep in reality. And frankly, we constructed the guide to have no real, kind of step up, or inflection either in bioprocessing. It may not happen that way, right? And if it does happen, if we do see something, an inflection that's higher, we obviously will update the guide and update everybody. But we are trying to just lay out how we are thinking about not having an inflection, not calling an inflection. Things are getting a little bit better. They're going to get better through the year. And certainly given the math and the anticipated modest step up, that's how you sort of get to a second half of tight single-digits. Remember, we're also working on a comp of the second half that's going to be down high teens. So, I think that's what gives us sort of the confidence is, we've got a little bit better customer visibility. We think we're going to be behind the destocking, and we've got some comps that will help those numbers.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. All right. I thought the $250 million was second half-to-second half, not first half to second half. But I can follow-up on that?
Matt McGrew: No, that is second half-to-second half. Yes, that's second half-to-second half. I'm sorry yes, yes.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. All right. We'll follow-up offline. Just a follow-up question. I want to ask a little bit on the Life Sciences segment and maybe put another way. I want to think about from a customer perspective, can you talk about pharma and biotech outside of bioprocessing, putting bioprocessing aside? For the rest of pharma and biotech, it seems like your outlook is still somewhat cautious. You're talking about low levels of demand. I'm just curious, any early signs? I know we're still in January, still early in the year, but just sort of how those companies are thinking about budgets for the year, how the Life Science segment and pharma and biotech specifically recovers post-2023? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: So, Michael, just to level set then, coming off a Q4, which the life science tools were down mid-single digits, and that was largely consistent with Q3, and we anticipate that this normalization in life science instruments, which really began in the second half of 2023, will continue in 2024. And if we think about it by end market, we do see pharma and biotech stabilizing, but at these lower levels of demand. Just because we believe and saw in the numbers showed here, over the last two years or so, an anomalous level of buying and pulling forward of demand, whether that was China through loan subsidies or whether that was COVID dollars infused for additional research, we expect that normalization to continue here. Also, in the first quarter, where we expect life sciences to be down similarly to the fourth quarter. Now, keep in mind for us, life sciences instruments is only about 10% of the portfolio. So, we may not be a good read across here. Nonetheless, we do think it's going to take some time here in the first quarter, first half, in order for that normalization to occur. But we do believe that it's stabilizing at this lower activity level.
Michael Ryskin: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Rachel.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Thanks so much. Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I wanted to push a little bit more on bioprocessing. You've noted that you're not modeling an inflection in that business this year, but can you talk about if you're seeing any of these green shoots from customers, signaling that they may have gotten too lean on inventory? And then if we look back at last year, you'd mentioned on the 4Q call that, you'd had conversations with customers that shifted your expectations around bioprocessing and order trends at the JPMorgan conference last year. So, can you talk to us about how those conversations with customers trended at the conference this year and how that's impacting the guide as well?
Matt McGrew: Yes, maybe I can start, and Rainer can probably - he had more of the customer conversations than I did, if we're being honest. So yes, I mean, I think when we think about the guide and you think about green shoots, I think maybe the way I would characterize it, is we - you know, six months ago, there were no anecdotes. There were no customers coming and saying, I needed something quickly. There were no pull-forwards from out-quarters into this quarter. I think, we have started to see a little bit more of that here anecdotally. I don't think it is widespread enough to be able to say, we're going to be beyond this in the next two, three months, which is why we sort of have our - the first half tagged where we do. But combined with the - our tracking of the inventory, so we do know where it is at. We've got a much better handle on that. Combined with sort of some of these anecdotes and frankly, a little bit better sort of funnels that we are seeing, we do feel like we've got a little bit better visibility as we head into the year, which gives us the confidence, as we talked about earlier, to think that the de-stocking is going to be largely behind us as we get through the first half. And that's sort of how we modeled into the - into the book-to-bill slowly kind of getting up. But not wanting to get, real aggressive and call a big inflection anywhere. So that's sort of how we - what we've seen here over the course of the last probably three, four months. So anecdotally, a little bit better situation out there. Are hearing some good things that you want to call it a green shoot, I suppose you could, but I'd probably call it, a good anecdote that is now starting to see more of those and sort of less of the negative ones, if you will. And maybe, Rainer, you want to talk about the customer discussions at JPM?
Rainer Blair: And just really just to confirm that we continue to see a trend of more positive conversations of customers returning to normal order patterns, thinking about how they're planning out not only the first, but the second half of the year. So all of these conversations are directionally, we believe, positive and sort of support what we saw also in the sequential improvement, which was partially seasonal certainly, but we also saw some improving order patterns there. So what we're looking for ultimately, and that's what Matt referred to previously, is a broad-based improvement in order patterns, at which point we will update accordingly. But where we sit today, we think that the first half will be slower also related to some of the comps that we talked about and that the positive development, which we've seen here in the past months, will continue and then manifest itself really in the second half where we then exit with high single-digits or better exit rate.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then my follow-up, I wanted to just press a little bit more on this pace of recovery within bioprocessing. So, one of your peers has slowly been taking up their book-to-bill sequentially over the last few quarters. They just recently crossed that 1.0 level. That said, though, Danaher is really one of the few companies, or only that has been actively working with customers to manage their inventory levels. So while I appreciate the guidance, isn't modeling a massive inflection at some point this year in bioprocessing, how should we think about that impact in managing your customers' inventory levels on what that does to the pace of recovery? And is there some reason why we shouldn't see more of a V-paced recovery - V-shaped recovery excuse me for Danaher? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Well, I mean, I think it's a little bit tough. When everybody is going to be, while we are all in the same kind of boat, I think everybody will have a slightly different timing about when we get through sort of the inventory destockings. So, I think part of it is going to be the breadth of our portfolio. Part of it is going to be the geographic mix we have, and part of it is going to be just sort of our customers and where we were kind of heavier or not. So, I think there's a lot that goes into it. So I think, it will be a little bit different for everybody. I think kind of each modality might be different as well. So cell culture media might be different from chromatography and filtration. So, I think all of those things combined sort of, are what we're seeing. I think everybody is going to see it at a different time, and I think you saw that with us in the first half of last year. We were - only down low singles, and I think some other folks were down mid-teens or more, right. So I think, there is going to be a little bit of a lag in timing. Could - to your second question, could we see a V? I mean it's possible, but we did not want to kind of model that in for a lack of a better - we don't have enough confidence right now. We have not seen it in the order book of enough magnitude and duration, to be able to call a turn of a V-shaped recovery. Is it possible? Sure. Anything is possible. But if we see that, we obviously would talk about it. But we're going to exit the year here at high single-digits from a high single-digit plus, frankly, as we exit the year. And if we do better than this forecast that, we have here of in the nines, that will have obviously an impact on - at some point the exit trajectory. I suspect it depends on when it happens. Specifically if it happens earlier, I think it would have an impact. But again, we're not planning for it. When we see it, we will obviously update and let people know. But for this guide, it is - you're trying to be transparent with everybody. That's what we're expecting, or what we're guys planning for.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning.
Puneet Souda: Yes hi, yes thanks, Rainer. My first question - I'm tempted to ask about bioprocessing, but let me stick with instrumentation first. Could you tell us what you're expecting for growth in instrumentation in 2024? And maybe if you could provide some context on the instrumentation recovery, and when can we potentially start to see that at a normalized sort of growth level?
Rainer Blair: We think, our life science instrumentation business will, for the year, be down low single-digits. And that's based really on a softer first half of the year and then slow, but persistent improvement here in the second half of the year. What are some of the drivers of that? Well, first of all, here in the first half, we are looking at some pretty significant comps. You will recall the China loan program in particular in the first half of last year, put us into mid to high-teens growth. And of course, at the current activity levels, that will result in a softer first half here. We also talked about the fact that pharma, biopharma, are constraining their investment a bit more along the lines of just recently having changed out, their installed base, taking advantage of additional dollars available during the pandemic and normalizing here as we get through the first half of the year. If we think geographically, China remains weak and we don't expect that to improve here. If anything, that will be a second half of the year dynamic. So life science is starting to stabilize really at the activity levels of the second half of last year. We expect that to continue through the first and then see gradual improvement here in the second half of the year, also from a comp perspective.
Puneet Souda: Got it. That's helpful. And then on Abcam, could you update us on the DBS efforts there? And what are you seeing in terms of the RU antibodies markets and expectations that you have for sort of Abcam in '24? And lastly, if I could just ask about after the Veralto spin, how are you thinking about capital deployment overall? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: So, first of all, Abcam, we couldn't be more pleased than having closed that early here in December. They had a good finish to the year and we are working with the team and we're up and running. And of course, you can imagine the DBS implementation is proceeding, in a focused way where the team is really pulling. So Abcam is on the way. Then as it relates to capital deployment, you heard my comments earlier around our balance sheet optionality, which is strong, we believe, differentiated. And post the Veralto spin, we'll continue, as we always have, to work on deploying that capital to strengthen our portfolio and continue to be active as always.
Puneet Souda: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, Todd. Everyone, we're around for follow-ups. Have a good rest of the day. Thanks.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our Form 10-Q for the third quarter, our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations, and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 8, 2023. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics related to the third quarter of 2023 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Before turning the call over to Rainer, I'd also like to point out that since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the third quarter, our financial highlights will include the combined Danaher and Veralto results. We will then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher. Veralto will be reporting their third quarter results separately later this week, and we'd like to ask that you please save any questions about the Veralto businesses until then. Our guidance for Danaher's continuing operations will exclude Veralto for the fourth quarter and the full year. I'd also like to mention that historical financial results reflecting only Danaher's continuing operations excluding Veralto are available on the Investors section of our website under the sub-heading Financial Reports. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Core revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher testing revenues more than offsetting slightly softer-than-expected demand in Life Sciences. Our team's consistent DBS-driven execution also enabled us to deliver better-than-expected earnings and cash flow in what remains a challenging and dynamic operating environment. This was also a transformative quarter for Danaher. On September 30, we completed the spin-off of Veralto Corporation, a global leader in water and product quality. The successful launch of Veralto is a testament to the team's execution focus and outstanding teamwork. We believe this separation creates exceptional opportunities for both Danaher and Veralto to better serve their customers, deliver on their respective strategic priorities and create greater long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. Now, I want to thank Jennifer Honeycutt and all the Veralto associates for their contributions to Danaher over the past two-plus decades. And we wish them the very best as they embark on their exciting endeavor to help safeguard the world's most vital resources. Now going forward, Danaher is a more focused life sciences and diagnostic innovator, committed to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. We've got a great line-up of leading franchises, well positioned in attractive end markets with durable, high-recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. This unique combination of our leading science and technology portfolio and financial strength all powered by the Danaher Business System, differentiates us, and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Now, as John mentioned, since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the third quarter, our financial highlights for the third quarter include Veralto's results. Sales were $6.9 billion in the third quarter and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 3% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 8.5%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High growth markets were down high single digits, including a mid-teens decline in China, where the economic landscape remains challenging. Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 58.2%. Our operating margin of 20.9% was down 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segment and costs related to the separation of Veralto. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.02. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 120%. Strong free cash flow generation continues to be one of the most important metrics at Danaher and enables us to actively pursue high-impact organic growth and M&A opportunities. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 19% and core revenue was down 21%. Bioprocessing core revenue declined over 20%, as anticipated, while discovery and medical was down mid-single digits as a result of lower demand from our earlier-stage research and lab filtration customers. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue declined mid-teens and market conditions were consistent with our expectations coming into the third quarter. Our customers are still working through inventory built up during the pandemic, while also continuing to conserve capital as a result of funding pressures. China was down approximately 45% in the quarter, driven by a weak funding environment and lower underlying activity levels. Based on what we're seeing today, we're maintaining our full year outlook of approximately 10% base business decline in bioprocessing, which assumes that market conditions in the fourth quarter are consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. Although these market dislocations are impacting our recent performance, global demand for biologic medicines continues to increase. Since 2018, underlying demand for biologics has grown at an average annual rate of approximately 10%, and is continuing to grow in 2023. In addition to more patients using biologic medicine, this year is on pace to be a record year for FDA approvals of biologics, including approvals for meaningful indications, such as Alzheimer's disease and several cancer immunotherapies. These positive trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and the high single-digit long-term growth outlook for our leading bioprocessing franchise. Now, the pace of innovation and advancement in biologic medicine is accelerating, and Cytiva is uniquely positioned to support customers as they pursue life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's recently launched NanoAssemblr, the industry's first end-to-end lipid nanoparticle formulation system, is a great example of how our investments in innovation are supporting customers' needs around quality, yields, and cost. The NanoAssemblr automates and streamlines the lipid nanoparticle manufacturing workflow, helping improve reproducibility and scalability in the nucleic acid therapy manufacturing process. Turning to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue declined 1% and core revenue was down 2.5%, including a low single-digit decline in our base business. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively declined mid-single digits, in part driven by China, where an already challenging funding environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed. Outside of China, we continued to see softness at pharma and biopharma customers, while demand remained stable in life science research and applied markets. Our genomics consumables based business declined low single digits in the quarter. Double-digit growth across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions, which are primarily used in projects that are in later stages of the drug development pipeline or have been commercialized, was more than offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. Our Life Sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicine. Molecular Devices recently released the CellXpress.ai, an artificial intelligence driven cell culture system that automates traditionally manual cultivation processes. The CellXpress.ai is engineered to improve workflows and reproducibility in growing and scaling human-relevant cell lines, which can reduce reliance on animal models and fast-track potential therapeutics to preclinical trials. We're also actively leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our capabilities and bring greater value to our customers. In August, we announced our intention to acquire Abcam, a leading producer of protein consumables that are critical for advancing drug discovery, life science research, and diagnostics. Abcam has a long track record of innovation, outstanding product quality, and breadth of antibody portfolio, which positions them as a key partner for the scientific community. The addition of Abcam will give Danaher entry into this highly attractive market, furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We expect Abcam will be accretive on multiple levels, including core growth, earnings, and talent, and look forward to welcoming this incredibly innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes. Now moving to our Diagnostic segment. Reported revenue declined 16% and core revenue declined 15.5%, with mid-single digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth. Radiometer led the way with high-single digit core growth and solid results across both blood gas and point-of-care immunoassay product lines. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in instrumentation and notable strength across clinical chemistry and immunoassay. Beckman's recent strong performance is a direct result of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve commercial execution. We're seeing better win and retention rates globally, particularly in North America, which grew high-single digits in the third quarter. The team has also been accelerating new product innovation, and there's encouraging early traction in Europe for the DxI 9000, Beckman's next-generation immunoassay analyzer. In molecular diagnostics, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive over 20% core revenue growth in non-respiratory testing at Cepheid, including more than 25% core revenue growth in Group A strep and sexual health. In respiratory testing, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $350 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $100 million. A higher prevalence of COVID-19 drove both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. As we move into the fourth quarter and our customers begin planning for the respiratory season, we now expect approximately $1.6 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year versus our previous expectation of $1.2 billion. The broad-based strength across Cepheid's testing menu is a result of the team's thoughtful approach to placing systems over the last few years. Customers who realized the benefit of accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing during the pandemic are increasingly consolidating their point-of-care testing platforms onto the GeneXpert and adding additional assays from our leading test menu. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their healthcare networks has led to a more than 2.5 times increase in both our installed base and revenue since 2019. And we believe Cepheid is well positioned to continue gaining share and expanding our installed base in today's endemic environment. Now let's briefly look ahead at the expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. As a reminder, both our fourth quarter and full year guidance include only Danaher's continuing operations and exclude Veralto. In the fourth quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be down mid-single digits year-over-year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the high-teens percent range, primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28%, which includes additional anticipated productivity initiatives to further adjust our cost structure. Turning to the full year 2023, we anticipate core revenues in our base business will be down slightly. And we also expect total core revenue to decline low double digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results and believe the combination of our team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis. With the successful spinoff of Veralto, we are now a more focused company committed to deploying leading-edge science and technology to improve human health. Danaher is purpose built to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Our proven ability to innovate is enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses and helping customers reduce the time and cost needed to sustainably develop and deliver life-changing therapies. So, as we look ahead, the unique combination of our talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, positions us well to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Brennan: Hey, guys. Hey, good morning, Rainer. How are you? Thanks for the questions here. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting off with bioprocess, if you don't mind, since there's remains, obviously, as you know, a tremendous amount of focus here. I know with Q2, you guys talked about order trends being down modestly in the second half of the year. Sounds like what you're seeing is consistent with that, but I was hoping maybe you can unpack a little bit of color on kind of what's going on in the order side for bioprocess and kind of what you're seeing in the field and kind of what this might portend as we think about looking out to 2024.
Rainer Blair: Sure, Dan. Let's start off with Q3 one more time here. So, Q3 results were consistent with what we expected. But also I have to be clear that we have not seen an inflection in orders. And I would say that we're sort of at the bottom here, bouncing along. And to give you a sense of this quantitatively, from -- our book-to-bill was at around 0.8, which is consistent with what we've been seeing here for the last few quarters. And for Q4, we think that looks a lot like Q3 with likely similar book-to-bill. But we do continue to expect our base business through the full year for bioprocessing to be down 10%, so as expected.
Matt McGrew: Hey, Dan, maybe just a little bit of other color, too, just to give some sense of what we saw. Orders in dollar terms were actually down a little Q3 versus Q2. And like Rainer said, the book-to-bill here has been at 0.8. It's been like that for six quarters. I think we anticipate that it will be like that in Q4 as well. And I think kind of another triangulation that I look at is kind of on a two-year stack here. Orders have been kind of, call it, down 32%, 33%, 34% here for the last three quarters. So, like Rainer said, I think we're looking at Q4, it looks a lot like Q3, but no real change here.
Dan Brennan: Got it. Thanks, guys. And then maybe just one just kind of zooming out a little bit, if you could. Just any way -- any helpful way to think about -- obviously, we have Q4 ahead of us, and you talked about the dynamic environment, which we all -- which we can all see, which we have better visibility, but we can all see it. But as we -- if you thinking about flipping the calendar to 2024, any early way to think about like a framework for revenue growth and earnings and margins as we get into the new year?
Rainer Blair: Dan, I think as you look towards 2024, it's really important to understand the context here of the second half, so let me lay that out for you briefly. Once again, our Q3 exceeded expectations. Diagnostics was better than we expected, driven by strength at Beckman Diagnostics and respiratory testing at Cepheid. And bioprocessing was as expected, and we don't believe that changes here either. So, we do believe that we're at the bottom here in 2023 in bioprocessing. That's partially offset by weaker life science instruments. And as a reminder, life science instruments for us is less than 10% of our total business. So, Q3, all in, a solid outperformance in the quarter with what we think are some important markers around diagnostics, bioprocessing and life science instruments. And as you think about Q4, in there, bioprocessing and diagnostics, there's really no change to our prior expectations. We expect those to continue to perform similarly as we've talked about in the past in Q3. Now, as it relates to life science instruments, there we've seen some incremental weakness in Q3 and we would expect that to continue or step down slightly here in Q4. So, with that as a context, for the second half, there's really no change to revenue as Q3 offsets Q4. So, we're holding the full year here. And there's also no change to our bioprocessing expectations for the year, and we continue to believe that 2023 represents the bottom. Now, as it relates to 2024 and given where markets are today and the broader macro, we want to see how Q4 plays out before we provide a guide on our Q4 earnings call in January as we always do. We want to see the next couple of months here play out and then build the guide, as always, for our January earnings call.
Dan Brennan: Got it. Thanks, Rainer. Thanks, Matt.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: One, I just wanted to go back to this bioprocessing. So, with book-to-bill of 0.8x, I guess, is bioprocessing going to grow next year if orders are below revenues in that '23? I don't know if there's a restocking phenomenon. Like, how should we generally broad strokes on bioprocessing, the plus and minuses as we look at the outlook, right? Should China inflect, or any levers that you have that could move bioprocess?
Rainer Blair: So, I think I come back to the actual data, Vijay, that we see, which is Q3 really was very similar to Q2. The book-to-bill was the same. We saw the market develop as we had anticipated. You know from our prior call that we've been working with customers here to take some of the tension out of the system and try and ensure that as much inventory is burned off as possible here in the year. And that's why we're confident that this is the bottom. But as it relates to 2024, there's a lot of moving pieces here and it's quite hard to draw generalizations. And that's why it's so important for us also to see the data here for another quarter in Q4 before we talk about what it looks like in 2024. Now having said that, we do expect that this inventory dynamic and what's going on in China is going to also go into, if you will, impact into 2024 as well. This doesn't stop at midnight on the 31st of 2023. But we have seen a stabilization here with the last two quarters, and we want to see how Q4 develops before calling 2024 in January.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. Matt, one for you. Thanks for giving the stand-alone numbers. I think it looks like the stand-alone margins here, ex-EAS for Danaher for fiscal '23 is about 28.5% sort of rough numbers, and that includes, I believe, perhaps $400 million of cost actions. What's the right way to think about cost actions, Matt? Is that -- should that all come out next year, so the right jump-off point for us ex cost actions is 30% and that's how we should be thinking about margins for next year?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. I mean, I think we'll kind of give a complete update when we come out because the core growth is going to be a big driver of margins. But just on the cost action part, yeah, I think you're right. I think the way I'd probably characterize it is $350 million of one-time cost actions. We talked about $200 million in Q2 and Q3. So that would be, again, the kind of one-time cost actions. Another $150 million here in Q4, and like you said, that will roll forward and help next year. But that is sort of a net number, right, if you will. We will have other pieces, some of them pretty meaningful here that will impact margins. So think of, like I said, first core growth will have an impact. FX, as we sit here right now, is going to have an impact, and there will be some other cost headwinds. So, when we get to the guide here in January, we'll sort of take that net 150 basis points, if you will, of margin tailwind probably and see what those offsets are to end up where we are for '24. But that's $350 million is probably the right number to think about as one-timers that go away here for next year.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, everybody. Rainer, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, China, kind of down 45% on the biopharma side, I think you said. But could you walk us through, first of all, what is the materiality of China now that Veralto has gone, percent of sales? I don't think we have that number. And second, just kind of walk us through the different markets in China, and maybe any color or outlook or something on how that is bottoming out or hopefully bottoming out?
Rainer Blair: Sure, Scott, and thanks for the question. So just to the materiality of China here post Veralto, I think 12% is a good number to think about as a total revenue. And now to your point, let me take you through what we saw across the portfolio here in the third quarter. So, let's start with bioprocessing. There, we did not see a change in market demand, which has been here now for several quarters impacted by a weaker funding environment and excess capacity, and that was down 45%, as mentioned previously. Life Sciences was worse than expected on a weaker macro as well as at the margin, not to overread this, but at the margin, some of the anti-corruption initiatives in the country, which slowed down some equipment tenders, some installation of equipment at the margin. And in Diagnostics, we're seeing consistent patient volumes, and it's largely back to normal. So, we expect -- we don't expect this to change here going forward in Q4, and also expect that this is going to continue into 2024. So, we haven't seen a change in bioprocessing, Life Sciences, the worse at the margin here in Diagnostics as expected and largely back to normal.
Scott Davis: Okay. Very helpful. And just to switch gears, there's talk about M&A multiples. In this type of rate environment, you would expect at least some moderation. I didn't feel like Abcam was necessarily cheap despite some of the drama that is out there. It certainly seems fully priced even at higher rates. But as you look at the rest of your pipeline, is there some relief in multiples that kind of reflect the reality of the higher rate environment?
Rainer Blair: Scott, I would tell you that we take it, as we always do, based on the end market, the asset and the financial model individually. And as we look at our funnel, which is very active, there's no doubt that some valuations still do not reflect what is a higher and likely for some time, sustained interest rate environment. When it comes down to the individual deal, we bring all aspects together and ensure that the deal model meets our expectations as well. And then, we -- as I've always said, we'll pull the trigger if all those lights flip green on end market, the actual target company, as well as the financial market -- financial model, excuse me. And then, lastly, to reiterate, we do think valuations still have some ways to go here on average in order to reflect the interest rate environment.
Scott Davis: Helpful, Rainer. Best of luck. See you guys. See you, Matt and John. Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Ryskin: Good morning, Rainer, Matt, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow up a little bit on the Life Science weakness. It sounds like you guys are pretty clear that in 3Q, that was the biggest step down sequentially versus 2Q and versus your expectations. We have it in our notes that LS instruments grew mid-single digit 2Q and now declined mid-single digit 3Q. So, could you parse that out a little bit SCIEX versus Beckman by geographies, by customer? Where you're seeing the slowdown? Do you think it's tied to some of the broader weakness you're seeing in pharma biotech? And just any thoughts on -- you already provided some commentary on 4Q, but any thoughts longer term on when that could return to growth? Just because you think that LS instruments would have a slightly longer order books, you get -- you have a little bit more visibility there. So, some forward commentary would be helpful. Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Mike. So, let's level set on the numbers here. Our instrument portion of our Life Science tools is less than 10% of Danaher revenue, just to put that in context properly. And as we mentioned, our Q3 performance was modestly below our expectations, with higher-end instrumentation holding up better than the less specialized solutions. Now, if you think about this by end market, academic and life science research have held up well along with the service business that's associated with these instruments. Applied markets were also resilient, led by food and environmental. And within environmental, you are aware of the PFAS testing volumes out there. But pharma and biotech took a modest step down, and that was particularly the case in the U.S. In China, we see large pharma customers also tightening their belts as it relates to capital expenditures. We were just talking about the interest rate environment, and that's playing out here as well. And in China, what we're seeing there is just the sunsetting of the subsidized loan program of the first half of the year and very high comps, as well as the lower funding that's available in the marketplace today in China. So, just to wrap in geographically, our developed markets were down largely due to the softness in pharma and biotech. And China, as we just talked about, was really related to the weaker macro, and, like I said earlier, on the margin only some anti-corruption initiatives there. So, as we wrap up there, I think we remain cautious on LS tools and expect Q4 to be down in the high singles versus -- but still at the low singles for the full year. Now, as it relates to '24, like I said, I think Q4 is a very important quarter here for all kinds of reasons. As you know, in the Life Science business, a lot happens in Q4, and it's also going to tell us a lot as we dialogue with our customers about how to view 2024, which as I mentioned, we'll talk about in January. But I do think it's fair to say that we expect a weaker pharma and biopharma end market here going into 2024.
Michael Ryskin: Great, thanks. That's really helpful. And then maybe as a quick follow up, I just want to touch on China a little bit. I'm not going to ask about '24 outlook, because I think you made it clear you're not going to address that. But just longer term, structurally, China has been a major part of the growth for tools as an industry and for Danaher over the last five, 10 years. Given everything that's happened over the last year, what's your view on China going forward on a multi-year basis? Will it still be accretive to total company, meaning above total company growth? Or do you think China, sort of, is really taking a step back here and it's going to be a multi-year process for it to return to that level? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: We think China long-term continues to accrete to the fleet average from a growth perspective, Mike. The demand in China, we're just at the tip of the iceberg of the demand in China for biologic drugs. And there's no question that we're currently going through a reset that's based on many of the things that occurred during the pandemic, if you think about the funds that were spent in the Zero COVID effort over several years, if you look at how the pharmaceutical industry is playing out in China. But all those things over time moderate, and you come back to an end market which has an enormous demand of a population which has already a large and increasing middle class and is really demanding access to the most advanced medications in the world. So, we continue to see China as a opportunity here in the mid and long term, because the fundamentals are in the right place, although we are going through, if you will, a reset here with different funding sources and so forth in the short term.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Puneet Souda.
Puneet Souda: Hey, Rainer, thanks for taking the questions. Quite a bit of coverage here, so maybe let me ask about something that is being discussed in healthcare markets and even now food and consumer markets, and that's the GLP-1s and the diabetes weight loss drugs whose indications are expanding here. So, I'm wondering if you can provide some context on if you see contributions from these drugs in sort of 2024, anything there that can potentially help you offset some of the headwinds? And maybe within that context, if you could also just talk about how should we weigh the GLP-1's opportunities versus Alzheimer's, which is also a very large market, I believe, for the mAbs?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Puneet. Let's start with the GLP-1, which are real and they are growing, and Danaher is represented into some extent, stacked into all of them, and we expect over time for those to contribute to our growth. Having said that, GLP-1s are a class of drugs where the intensity of the use of, if you will, the standard inputs of biologic processes, for instance, such as mAbs, and I'll come back to that part of your question in a second, is not as intense. So, you have synthetic processes for GLP-1s, you have biologic processes, and depending on how that mix develops, that also impacts the degree to which this contributes to our business. This will contribute to our business, and we think that, that provides a modest tailwind here over time. Now, as it relates to your question around Alzheimer's drugs, those are typically monoclonal antibodies, and the use of our industry's products there is far greater than, for instance, in GLP-1 processes. And as those continue to make their way through the development pipeline, through the regulators, and ultimately get reimbursed and then adopted by patients, we expect that to be a more significant tailwind certainly than GLP-1.
Puneet Souda: Got it. Super. And then if I could follow up on Abcam, could you talk about where you see the biggest opportunities for cost reduction here in the antibodies business and the protein reagents business? And maybe where DBS can have the most impact? And wondering if -- what do you have in your algorithm longer term for the op margins for this business eventually? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: So, Puneet, we have yet to close on this transaction, so we won't be able to talk about the model and its contents in any detail here. But I do want to take a second to reiterate that this acquisition, if that's an entry into a really highly attractive protein consumables market, we estimate that market to be over $8 billion and growing high single digits. And very importantly, because of new detection technologies and other approaches, protein detection is now moving from research to biopharma, and we believe over time to the clinic. And so, you can see how that fits our strategy of helping to map complex diseases, accelerate drug discovery, and hopefully someday even help identify these diseases earlier in their progression. Now, this is a differentiated company with a really terrific brand and a great long-term sustainable business model. We've talked about this, but this is accretive to us in growth, in earnings and also in talent. And we're looking forward to welcoming the team here. We're still focused right now, Puneet, on closing this transaction by mid-2024.
Puneet Souda: I appreciate it. Thanks, Rainer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Rachel. Good morning.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I want to follow up with a few more nuanced questions on China. So, first you mentioned that anti-corruption had some impacts to the Life Sciences segment. So, could you quantify the impact there? And then, can you walk us through, are you just seeing that impact in the healthcare and diagnostic hospital settings, or has that started to bleed into pharma and biotech as well? And then, shifting over to more the Diagnostic side for China, another dynamic that we started hearing about in recent weeks is just China volume-based procurement. So, can you walk us through what you're hearing on that front and what your potential exposure to that would be?
Rainer Blair: Sure, Rachel. Starting with anti-corruption, we really do see this as a transitory effect. There were some weeks, if I can say it that way, where we saw particularly equipment tenders being postponed, delayed, as well as the installation of hardware, so larger capital equipment. But frankly, we've seen that wane here, so come back to normal, if you will, in the last couple of weeks. And that applies both to what we saw there in Life Sciences, really, at the margin, as well as what we see in Diagnostics. So, I would not view the anti-corruption initiative as a shorter or even mid-term growth headwind. Frankly, in the long term, we think this is a positive as it levels the playing field for multinationals in China.
Matt McGrew: As far as the value-based procurement, Rachel, I think the best way to kind of think about it is I think we think it's going to be about a $50 million kind of annual headwind here for us over the next couple of years. Most of that is at Beckman Diagnostics. So I mean maybe kind of a simple math is $800 million of Beckman revenues and maybe 40% of that is sort of subject to the VBP kind of assume a 50% type price reduction there and you get to $150 million. We think that's kind of two, three year kind of run rate here. So, pretty modest and manageable for us over the period.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then, my follow up is just around Diagnostics. So, you guys listed that respiratory expectations for the year to $1.6 billion versus prior assumptions around $1.2 billion. So, how should we think about that endemic number for respiratory? Is $1.2 billion still on average the really way to think about this respiratory market? And then just heading into 2024, giving you guys listed expectations for this year by $400 million, should we expect a softer year next year for respiratory as well? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good question on the $1.2 billion. I think that's probably where my baseline would be, Rachel. And I think we did a little bit better this year because we had another respiratory season that started earlier than normal, right? Just like last year, similarly, we saw sort of September and October, the ILI kind of spiked up. That is usually something in the past that we have seen more in the January-February timeframe. So if I think about the last couple years and think about that, I think $1.2 billion would be sort of where I would base it as a planning kind of purpose going forward. But we sort of typically, as we look forward from planning perspective, do that. We look at the last couple years of ILI and try and mirror that. So that's kind of where I think I'd be.
Operator: Thank you. And that was our last question today. I will now turn the call back over to John Bedford for closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thank you everybody for joining. We'll be around the rest of the day for questions.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: And this does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Ashley, and I'll be your facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our Form 10-Q for the second quarter, our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well and delivered our quarterly revenue, earnings and cash flow expectations despite a more dynamic operating environment. The resilience of our portfolio showed through in the second quarter. High single-digit base business core revenue growth in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, paired with better-than-expected respiratory testing revenue, helped offset softer base business demand and bioprocessing. Our team's ability to navigate these challenging operating conditions is a testament to their commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. Their actions are helping mitigate supply chain constraints, enhance productivity and improve manufacturing throughput, and we're proactively addressing structural costs while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments. Now our second quarter results also highlight the durable balanced positioning of our portfolio. We have an exceptional group of businesses, all powered by DBS, that serve attractive end markets with favorable long-term secular growth drivers. This powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet optionality differentiates Danaher and positions us well to operate through today's more dynamic operating environment. So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.2 billion in the second quarter and core revenue declined 7%. We delivered 2% growth in our base business, which was more than offset by a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined high single digits, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High-growth markets declined low single digits, with China down approximately 10%. In China, our Diagnostics businesses benefited from continued recovery in hospital patient volumes, while stimulus initiatives helped drive strength in Life Sciences. This was more than offset by a decline in our Biotechnology business, where a significant deterioration in the funding environment during the quarter led to project delays and an increase in order cancellations. Our gross profit margin for the second quarter was 56.5%. Our operating margin of 20% was down 840 basis points due to the impact of lower volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments, and costs incurred to adjust our capacity and cost structure in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state. These actions in this transition year are intended to ensure that we're in the best position to deliver on our long-term growth and margin objectives, while maintaining an accelerated cadence of innovation investments. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.05. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date. This results in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 125%. Our notable strength in free cash flow generation differentiates Danaher and illustrates the quality of our portfolio, business models, and our team's consistent execution. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 17% and core revenue was down 16.5%. In bioprocessing, underlying market conditions weakened further as we move through the quarter, resulting in a high single-digit base business decline. Larger customers are still working through inventory they built during the pandemic, and emerging biotech customers, which we define as customers without a commercialized therapy, continued their efforts to conserve capital. In addition, we saw the ongoing biopharma market correction in China intensify as the second quarter progressed. Given these dynamics, where we can, we've started actively working with our larger customers to help them more quickly manage their inventory down to normalized levels. Now while market dislocations are impacting our near-term growth, recent positive developments have only strengthened our conviction in the tremendous long-term opportunity ahead in the biologics market and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. And during the quarter, we saw notable regulatory approvals for a novel gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the monoclonal antibody-based Alzheimer's therapeutic. These groundbreaking therapies are not only poised to improve quality of life for patients around the world, they're also serving as validation of these emerging therapeutic classes and reinforcing the potential of drugs currently in the development pipeline. Now in May, we completed the combination of Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, creating a premier global bioprocessing franchise. The combined business, which will go to market under the Cytiva name, uniquely positions us to support customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities and an innovation engine geared towards helping customers bring life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently. A great example is the Xcellerex X-Platform Bioreactor Cytiva launched in the second quarter. Now this new bioreactor is optimized to enhance cell culture productivity and increase process intensity to improve manufacturing yields. The X-Platform's modular design also enables customers to more predictively scale from the lab to production across all modalities, including monoclonal antibodies and cell and gene therapies, helping reduce time and cost in biologic drug production. Turning to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 5.5% and core revenue was also up 5.5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by nearly 10% growth at Leica Microsystems and high single-digit growth at SCIEX. Healthy demand across our life science, research, academic and applied markets, particularly for our more advanced instrumentation, helped offset softness at pharma and biopharma customers. Our genomics consumables based business was up low single digits in the quarter. Growth in plasmids, proteins and gene-writing and editing solutions, which are primarily used in projects that are commercialized or in later stages of the drug development pipeline, remained robust. This strength was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. Our Life Sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicines. IDBS recently released Polar Insight, a biopharma data management platform that is leveraging artificial intelligence to help researchers more quickly analyze datasets to accelerate drug discovery, regulatory filings and technology transfer in the therapeutic development process. And SCIEX launched the Intabio ZT, a front end to the ZenoTOF 7600 that enables researchers to more quickly and more securely identify and validate drug candidates, improving development workflows and pipeline yields. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue declined 13% and core revenue declined 11.5%, with high single-digit growth in our base business, more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Leica Biosystems led the way with high single-digit core growth driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid-single digits again this quarter, with solid performance across both instruments and consumables and notable strength in immunoassay. In May, Beckman Coulter launched the DxI 9000, their next-generation immunoassay analyzer that automates up to 90% of standard daily maintenance routines while delivering best-in-class throughput. In addition to significantly improving laboratory workflows and efficiency, the DxI 9000 will enable Beckman to provide a full menu of blood virus assays over time, closing an important menu gap and further enhancing the breadth and clinical value of our test menu. That is just one example of how the Beckman team is improving their competitive positioning through innovation, which is helping drive consistent mid-single-digit growth rate. In Molecular Diagnostics, broad-based strength across Cepheid test menu drove another quarter of more than 30% core growth in non-respiratory testing. Customers who benefited from the workflow advantages, Cepheid's GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing, are increasingly adding additional assays from our leading test menu, most notably Group A Strep, and hospital-acquired infection assays. And strong momentum for our recently introduced multiplex vaginitis panel, the Xpert Xpress MVP, contributed to mid-teens growth in sexual health testing. In COVID-related testing, Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $175 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B and RSV. We continue to expect approximately $1.2 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year. With COVID now in endemic state, we believe Cepheid is continuing to take share as many customers look to consolidate their point-of-care, PCR, testing platforms on to the gene expert for both respiratory and non-respiratory testing. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their health care networks is a testament to the significant value, the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow provides clinicians. Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 2% and core revenue was up 1.5%. Water quality core revenue grew mid-single digits and product identification was down mid-single digits. In water quality, DBS-led execution drove solid growth on top of a double-digit prior year comparison. Strong performance at ChemTreat and Hach was balanced across industrial and applied end markets. At Trojan, equipment sales and order rates remained strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects. At product identification, Videojet declined low single digits against the high single-digit prior year comparison. We're also seeing lower activity levels at our industrial and consumer packaged goods customers who are aligning their production schedules with end-use demand. The Videojet team continued their strong cadence of new product innovation this quarter with the release of the 3350 laser marking system. This impressive addition to Videojet's portfolio enables users to mark different sized products and multiple levels of the same product without adjusting the laser, resulting in increased uptime and higher throughput. This is one of several product introductions planned for the year that are helping position the product identification platform for success as they begin their journey as part of Veralto. So speaking of Veralto, we remain on track for a fourth quarter 2023 separation. Veralto will be well positioned in some of the most attractive areas of water quality and product identification. Their portfolio will be comprised of leading companies with durable high-margin business models, supporting customers' mission-critical operations. The Veralto team is looking forward to hosting an Analyst Day in Chicago on September 6, and we hope many of you will attend. So now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be down low single digits year-over-year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens percent range primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a third quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%, which includes the impact of efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our Diagnostics and Biotechnology businesses. Now turning to the full year 2023. Due to the near-term challenges within bioprocessing, we now anticipate low single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single to low double digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%. So to wrap up, our team remains focused on consistent execution in the face of a challenging and more dynamic macroeconomic environment. We're confident about the bright future ahead for Danaher. Our talented associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to our culture of continuous improvement. Across our portfolio, we're helping customers solve some of the world's biggest health care challenges, including faster, more accurate disease diagnosis and accelerating the discovery, development and manufacture of therapies. Our solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients around the world have access to quality care. Financially, we've got a great lineup of leading franchises in attractive end markets with durable, high recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. The unique combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, provide a strong foundation for creating shareholder value, while helping to meaningfully improve human health. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Ryskin: Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start on bioprocessing, the obvious one. You provided a lot of comments during the prepared remarks. But I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about order trends, anything that you're seeing from customers to give you a sense of when that destocking could continue. As part of that, you also talked a little bit about actively managing inventory with the larger customers. Could you just walk us through what that means exactly? And sort of how you see the rest of the year playing out? You gave the total percent number, but qualitatively, what are your thoughts on bioprocess as you go through the year?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So let's start with orders. In the first half of the year, our orders were essentially down 20%. And as we look forward here to the second half of the year, we think that our orders will be down modestly. That's a combination of various factors. One being that our large customers, CDMOs, continue to work through inventories. We also see that China continues to deteriorate here from what we saw in the first quarter and certainly saw that deterioration in the second half of the second quarter, and we see that continuing. And then we are actively managing inventories down. While that is not new, we've intensified our efforts there really in order to get as much as possible of the stocking topic behind us here in 2023.
Matt McGrew: Mike, maybe just - let me give you a little color on some numbers here, too. I think if you think about the first half, like Rainer said, we were sort of down 20% from an order perspective. And like you also said, I think we'll be down modestly in the second half. But I think it's important to remember, too, this is largely driven by the comps that we've got. So if you think last year, the first half, we had kind of a low double-digit comp, in the second half was more like 20%. So step up, get a little easier here in the second half. I think the important thing that Rainer just said is we have not seen in the order book enough to call an inflection in the market, but I think we will see a step up to a more modestly down number here in the second half. But I would really characterize that as very much comp driven, not some sort of market inflection that we're seeing.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up on China specifically. You talked a lot about China and 2Q deteriorated, particularly as it touched on biopharma market correction. Could you expand on that just how significant and how protracted do you believe that will be? And it seems like it's really mostly contains the bioprocess, you called out instrumentation in China actually holding in pretty well. What's the difference there? Why is it so specific to just that one part of your business?
Rainer Blair: So we saw that continued deterioration in the second half of the second quarter. To give you a sense, China orders were down 20% in the first quarter, 40% in the second quarter, but really 50% in June. And frankly, we don't see that getting better here in the second half. And that's really related to two or three factors. One, the funding environment continued to deteriorate. The foreign investment in projects and capacity has dissipated, it has not returned. There are fewer projects there that are being funded. Also, over the last two, three years, a great deal of capacity has been built, particularly CDMO capacity, but also some with the smaller biopharmas there. And so there's not a lot of additional hardware required here in the short term in the second half, nor are there that many molecules that are being worked on by the CDMOs, meaning that the consumables requirements of that capacity are also lower than we saw here in the first half of the year. And then lastly, and part of this is related to our aggressively managing with our customers to get them to their target inventories, there are a fair number of order cancellations there. So when you put all that together here for China, that is a different picture here in the second half than we saw in the first half. And once again, we're working here, if you aggregate this to the total global biopharma business, to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023. And just to give you a sense here, our China business in 2022 was about $1.3 billion, slightly over that. We expect that to be about an $800 million business by the end of 2023, which would be about 10% of the total bioprocessing business at Danaher.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Hi Rainer. Good morning to you, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess on the bioprocessing commentary, Rainer, if you just simplify the various moving parts. It seems like large pharma was in-line-ish - early stage was in line-ish. What changed incrementally in 2Q was China? And if that is correct, I think you mentioned China was that down 50% in June, is the second half assuming down 50% for China bioprocessing? And I think you also mentioned Danaher's actively managing customer inventory levels, what does that mean? And what is the implication for fiscal '24? Should any of these issues be lower into '24?
Matt McGrew: Vijay, it's Matt. Let me give - I just want to kind of set the numbers for everybody, so we've got what we're looking at for China. As you said, from a revenue perspective, in the first half, we were down, call it, 30%. And we did see May and June sort of get down into the more like 45%, 50% down. So as we sort of think about what we're thinking about for China going forward for the second half, we are kind of contemplating, if you will, for Q3 and Q4 both of those quarters to look like May and June, and call it, 50% plus down. With that, maybe, Rainer, you want to give some color on the commentary.
Rainer Blair: Sure. Vijay, as it relates to '24, we have a lot to work through here still, I think, as an industry in the second half of 2023. We talked about the various puts and takes of the destocking that I think you correctly summarized with pharma and emerging biotech. You see the China piece that we're flagging here. And then, of course, actively managing those inventories with our customers here in order to get as much as possible behind us in 2023. And we think 2023 probably is the bottom. Having said all that, it is a little early to be talking about 2024. And as always, as we get closer here to the end of the year, we'll continue to update as we work through the second half here.
Vijay Kumar: Understood, Rainer. And Matt, maybe one for you on margin share. I think if your second quarter came in slightly above guidance. But the sequential step down from Q1, that's 450 basis points, can you bridge us on what drove that 450 basis point step-down sequentially? I think some of this is cost actions Danaher undertook? And again, when I look at the annual guidance, I think you implied Q4 is perhaps 31%-ish. What drives the -- 31-ish. What drives that Q4 step-up? And does that assume your bioprocessing inventory levels to step up? Bioprocessing orders exiting Q4, is that assuming like a normalized trends? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Yes. No, I think that's right. You got that right. So Q1, we were kind of call a 31% margin, step down to 26.5% in Q2. I think, we're going to be more like 26% in Q3 and then a step up to 31% in Q4. If you remember, last quarter, we sort of talked about a bunch of capacity adjustment, if you will, measures, not only at Summit Biotech, but remember, significantly at Cepheid, as the volumes there ramp down, we are being pretty proactive about taking down that capacity as we talked about. So really, the step down in Q2, Q3 is largely due to: one, lower volumes; but two, remember, we had this big capacity reduction costs. Those are primarily Q2, Q3, and then they sort of go away here in Q4, combined with higher volume in Q4 is how we get to kind of 31%. That really has no bearing or impact on anything to do with the bioproduction inventory, et cetera. I mean, it just incorporates our guide of kind of bioproduction ex COVID down 10%. So really all about the higher volume and the capacity reduction stuff that we're working on kind of heading out of the P&L in Q2 and Q3.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take the next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Good morning Rainer, Matt and John. Yes, I was hoping you could put a little bit more teeth into this cost out and just a little bit more color, even if you, I mean in a perfect world, I'd love to see what the actual - what the tailwinds might be for '24 or what the benefit is? But if you're not willing to go down that path, at least help us understand what's perhaps more rooftop versus labor versus - I know when times are tougher like this, maybe your comp accruals are down, but maybe you guys can give us a little detail will be helpful? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yes. So Scott, the capacity reduction, we talked last quarter that we had about $350 million of cost that was going to come through in Q2 and Q3. We said probably about $250 that was going to be at Cepheid, and that is a rooftop effort, right? During the pandemic, we added some rooftops to kind of meet demand. Now, we're kind of scaling that back. So that is a little bit of a rooftop dynamic as well as a people dynamic as we scale down to where we are. About $100 million of that $250 million is over the same concept, but at BTG, given some of the lower demand there. I would characterize that less as rooftops and more sort of other actions around kind of demand levels, if you will, at BTG. So that's sort of the $350 million we talked about last quarter. Some of that $350 million is going to be sort of one-time, if you will, right? And then probably something in the range of a couple of hundred million of it will be a bit of a one-time cost that we are hitting and taking P&L in this year that probably should come back to us here next year as well, as the savings that we have moving forward. We haven't really talked about the savings, Scott. That's going to be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done here in Q4 or Q3 - Q2, Q3 and then what gets done in Q4 as well. And so, it will be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done as to what the savings, the annualized savings will be. So, we sort of told people last quarter that we kind of update that as we get towards the guide for next year to kind of bake in some of the savings number. So, I haven't really gotten that yet. I've got - I have a sense or an idea, but I do want to see if we can get everything done and kind of where we end up before we talk about how much is coming. But I do think we've talked last quarter about that sort of one-time benefit of, call it, a couple of hundred million dollars.
Scott Davis: All right. That's helpful, Matt. And it wasn't clear to me why [AIS] margins were down. Is it kind of price cost, just because I'm assuming had maybe negative actual unit volumes with core up 1.5%? But is it mix price cost? Is there anything - I know there's probably some prep into the spin that may add some near-term costs as well, but some color there would help too? Thanks.
Matt McGrew: Yes. Yes, I would say yes to probably all of the above, Scott. I think you're right. It was a little bit of a price cost. I think they are starting to see an environment where they had really good price actions as some of the supply chain issues and supplies and logistics issues, they were able to kind of cover with price. But I think you're right, we're starting to see a little bit of that come down, probably not terribly unusual. Some of it, they were able to offset with other measures. But you're right. I think you kind of look at what happened there in the quarter, it was a little bit of it. Volumes were on the margin sort of down, but the price side did hold us up. But that price is coming down a little bit from where it was, but that was kind of what happened in the quarter. And like you said, also ramping up into the spin here probably had an impact as well.
Scott Davis: Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for the color. And best of luck to rest of you guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Scott.
Matt McGrew: Thanks Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Dan.
Daniel Brennan: Yes, thanks. Good morning Rainer, how are you doing? Thanks for the questions here. Maybe the first one just on - the company is obviously a superior executor, DBS is at your core. So the string of bioprocess guide down is pretty uncharacteristic, but it's also a situation that has plagued many peers. So I'm sure you're always doing forensic reviews, so you go - your future forecasting improves in terms of what you've learned? So can you just give us a sense of the latest bioprocess guide and what will provide confidence that the factors that surprised you here and led to the latest cuts won't surprise you again, and now the guide incorporates enough cushion. So that investors can have confidence at the bottom of the bioprocess guidance has been reached?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan. I appreciate that question. And as you can imagine and as you suggested, we are constantly, continuously improving our forecasting processes even when we get into these unusual circumstances. And I think one of the aspects here is that the demand situation, the production planning of our customers around the world in the short-term is very dynamic in the sense that production plans are being changed as our customers manage their own inventories as they deal with the demand patterns that they're exposed to. And what we have learned out of that is a more frequent touch point pattern that we have to have with our customers in order to ensure that we keep our finger on the pulse of what's going on there. We think that in the discussions that we've had, that taking the approach of aggressively helping our customers manage their inventories to their target levels in order to find what the true demand signal is. As well as thinking about the second half here, with some degree of conservatism, positions as well in what has been a very dynamic environment with a number of new factors influencing demand. So, we think we're well positioned here for the remainder of the year in terms of the bioprocessing guide.
Matt McGrew: Maybe, Dan just a bit, maybe just my thoughts on that topic. I think like Rainer said, I think given what we saw in Q2, I think we feel like we've got sort of China in a pretty good place from a guidance perspective given what we saw. Given the fact that we began that active management in earnest in kind of the back half of Q2 and are going to be pretty aggressive with that to get everything, if possible, behind us that we can here in 2023. I think this guide puts us in a pretty good place for the rest of the year.
Daniel Brennan: Great. And then maybe just thinking about the exit rates that are implied in the guidance. I know you already commented, Rainer, '24 official guidance will come later. But it'd be really helpful just to get some frame of reference about key inputs. I mean we're coming out somewhere in $930 million this year on earnings, and maybe a little below $10, maybe $980 for '24. I know consensus is still of 10/23 as of this morning. So just any help about how we think about the trajectory in '24, either from an earnings basis. And also even given the low single-digit base guide for this year, how we think about that comp and what that could translate into a starting point for base organic growth in '24?
Rainer Blair: So Dan, I do think that it's early to talk about 2024, because we still have an entire half of the year in front of us here with a number of factors to work through. We talked about the destocking dynamic in China, as well as our efforts to actively get the destocking situation behind us here in 2023. And we think that ultimately, we're probably seeing, in 2023, the bottom here and what is the bioprocessing stocking dynamic. And we also - and I talked about this in the prepared comments, are positive about the long-term growth of this business and this industry. But it's just too early to be putting down a marker here in July on how we think about 2024, and do promise to come back here later in the year to update and then, of course, as always, provide our guide in January for 2024.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Puneet.
Puneet Souda: Yes, hi. Good morning, Rainer and Matt, thanks for taking the questions. So first one, on China, beyond the comments you made and the 50% expectation down for the rest of the year, orders being down. I'm wondering if there is anything fundamental in terms of the shift on the product portfolio? We heard one of your bioprocess peers talk about competition on the less technology-heavy products. Wondering if you're seeing any of that and any share shift there that is also happening in this market?
Rainer Blair: Puneet, our point of view on China is that the continued deterioration is far more about demand and funding than it is about local competition. The local competition has always been there. No question during the pandemic local competition became more relevant as lead times extended. And where we do see that local competition, it tends to be more for local China for China therapeutics than for products that find global applications. So for us, this is really a topic at the margin. And the real story here is that the funding environment as well as the stocking situation in China requires further mediation here in the second half, and that's exactly what we're doing in order to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023.
Puneet Souda: Okay. That's super helpful. And then one on capital deployment, if I may. How are you thinking about capital deployment now with EAS spend and the backdrop of somewhat of a rather weak end market in the near term? I know historically, you've pursued leading assets that are usually gross margin accretive, wondering if any of that has changed and if you think services has gained more significance in your framework for capital deployment now? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Sure. So Puneet, for us, M&A require - continues to be the primary form of capital deployment. And we do that when we see the end market, the asset and the model, the financial model aligns with our requirements. And that is relevant for any end market or adjacency that we might be thinking about, and we maintain a consistent perspective there. Now having said that, you've likely noted that our balance sheet is in great shape and we are in a market that provides opportunity, and we continue, as we always do, to work our M&A funnels to find those opportunities where all three lights flip to green, if you will, market company as well as the business model.
Puneet Souda: Got it. Okay. Thank you guys.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Rachel.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. So first off, just kind of shifting gears over to the Life Sciences business, that was much better than expected this quarter. And notably, instrument strength was pretty strong, with high single-digit growth at SCIEX and 10% growth at Leica? So could you just walk us through really what drove that strength in instruments this quarter? And then some of your peers have called out a meaningful slowdown when it comes to CapEx spending in some of the customer segments for instrumentation. So, are you seeing any of those same dynamics? And how are you thinking about instrument growth for the full year?
Rainer Blair: Thanks for the question, Rachel. So as you suggested, our Q2 Life Sciences business finished, as expected, up mid-single digits. And we've been talking about a normalization process for some time now, and that's also what we're expecting going forward. And I'll come back to that in a minute. But if we look at the strength here of mid-single digits, geographically, the U.S. was okay. I would exclude large pharma there and sort of small biotech where that's relevant. The EU, Europe was solid. And we also saw a good level of activity in China on the remainder of the stimulus for the subsidized loan program that China had in place. Now from an end market perspective, we see the academic end market holding up well. We see the applied markets, if you think of food testing, environmental testing, with some strength. But as I mentioned, we see biotech and pharma softer. If you think about this from a product category perspective, we think lower and less-expensive, perhaps even operating cost versus capital expenditure type of equipment, is impacted more severely than the higher end, which we still see holding up, and you saw that with Leica Microsystems and SCIEX as well. So as we think about the second half here, we continue to be cautious for a couple of reasons. We mentioned that China market, while strong, the subsidies there have come sunset at the end of the first quarter. and we'll have to see how that continues. There's no news on that front going forward. And so we think really the second half ends up being flat for Life Science instrumentation, putting the full year at low single digits as the normalization process, if you will, from what has been over several years now, very elevated growth rate continues.
Matt McGrew: And Rachel, that's sort of on the back, too, if you think about the bookings here. I mean our book-to-bill in Life Sciences in the Instruments businesses was a little bit less than one in the quarter. So I think to Rainer's point, we look at the first half year in China for Life Sciences instruments, that was largely a backlog play from stimulus. And as we sort of head into the second half, I think our assumption is that we're going to be flat in those businesses as China stimulus backlog kind of rolls off and not have the impact that it had in the first half. And we just don't see a real step up here in stimulus in the second half.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you for all the color there. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing. Can you walk us through how much was pricing and impact for instruments in the quarter? And what are you assuming for pricing on instruments in the back half of the year? And then as a follow-up, just pricing on bioprocessing. For bioprocessing, it sounds like you took 350 basis points of pricing in 1Q. What was that pricing contribution in 2Q? And then how are you thinking about pricing evolving within bioprocessing in the back half of this year and also just heading into '24? Last year, you guys took 400 basis points of price in bioprocessing. Obviously, the industry is pretty dynamic right now. So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Rachel, overall, our pricing for the quarter, so overall banner, was up 350 basis points with all four segments remaining above the historical average. And specifically, you were talking about Life Science Instruments, there we saw in the quarter 450 basis points of price. Now as we look forward for the remainder of 2023, we do see that and expect that to moderate somewhat. But we do expect to be above our historical averages here for the remainder of the year. And as it relates to 2024, I think we'll come back to you on that as we get closer here to the end of the year.
Operator: Okay. We'll take our final question from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Luke.
Luke Sergott: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. This is just kind of - to follow up on Danny Brennan. I know you guys aren't going to give '24 given how everything is dynamic. But I think that the destocking is what it is, right? That's rolling off. That shouldn't be '24, but that sets up an easy comp. And so I was just trying to figure out right now what the industry demand is to support the type of overall industry growth. So typically, the market growth - the bioprocessing market is like high double to mid-teens, and that's in a normalized market. And so how quickly do you think we can get back to that level? And then on top of that, you have the comps, which would take you over that. Or do you think that there are going to be in a period of subdued contraction from a demand and capacity perspective, given COVID rolling off, you have China, the headwinds there? There are several other - the lack of biotech funding. So give us a sense what that normalized market looks like for you guys right now.
Matt McGrew: Luke, I mean, I just keep coming back to - it's July. We're in a pretty dynamic market, where we are within the industry. And like you said, there's a number of dynamics that still need to be worked through. We mentioned some of them destocking, China, the fact that we're sort of actively managing through this inventory situation. I know why people are trying to get to a '24 number, but I just think it's too early. We just need to get through the second half. We'll get a better sense of how those dynamics play out, which will give us a lot better sense as we get later in the year and into what we normally guide and what that looks like. I just think that there's so many in parts right now that, unfortunately, I think we just do - we really do need to get through the second half here.
Luke Sergott: Yes, I understand. And then, I guess, like can you quantify how much destocking was in the quarter for you guys and kind of year-to-date?
Matt McGrew: I mean I could probably come up with some numbers, but it would be imprecise. I think the reality is that it's going to be very customer dependent. It's going to be manufacturing site depending. It's going to be drug dependent. I mean we don't really spend a lot of time trying to figure out how much was destocking as much as spending time with the customers in a pretty proactive way these days, to understand what's on hand, what's the real need that you've got site by site by site so that we can help them manage down to an inventory level they are comfortable with. Some are comfortable with getting down where they were pre-pandemic, some are trying to get below that and some are trying to be above that, actually. So it's not one number that we manage that we're really doing on a kind of neutral basis. I don't know that I've got a great answer for a number, but we are actively managing it and probably a way that was more active than we have been.
Luke Sergott: Got you. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Bedford for closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We'll be around the rest of the day and week for follow-up questions. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 15:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Ashley and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today’s call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 9, 2023. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the first quarter of 2023 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So we had a good start to the year. Our team successfully navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver better-than-expected revenue earnings and cash flow. We are especially pleased with the strength of our base business, which grew 6% in the first quarter. Now across the portfolio, the quarter progressed largely as we anticipated. Our global supply chain has stabilized and component availability improved sequentially. Strong price realization helped offset inflationary pressures and disciplined cost management enabled us to continue our cadence of growth investments. So we believe these investments paired with DBS-driven execution contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses again this quarter. A prime example of the power of DBS and our commitment to continuous improvement at all levels of Danaher as the CEO Kaizen, which we kicked off 2 weeks ago. With this event, our most senior leaders are joining over 700 associates at 10 of our operating companies. We are focusing on the most significant opportunities for lasting competitive advantage across our businesses, including further reducing our best-in-class lead times at Aldevron and improving resin and filter throughput in the biotechnology group. The CEO Kaizen is just another terrific opportunity for our teams to come together and drive transformative change through DBS. In fact, once we wrap up here today, I will be joining the Cytiva team at our resin facility in Uppsala, Sweden, to contribute to these efforts. Now our results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher’s portfolio. We just have an exceptional group of leading franchises serving attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the optionality to enhance our businesses both organically and through disciplined M&A. This powerful combination of our talented team, leading portfolio and strong financial position, differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let’s turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.2 billion in the first quarter and core revenue declined 4%. So as I mentioned earlier, we delivered 6% core revenue growth in our base business with three of our four reporting segments, up high single-digits or better in the quarter. COVID-19 revenues were a headwind of approximately 10%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined mid single-digits, primarily as a result of lower COVID-19 revenues. High-growth markets were up low single-digits, with a low single-digit decline in China. Results in China were better than expected driven by a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in diagnostic testing and a more favorable life science research funding environment. We expect these positive trends to continue as we move through the year. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61%. Our operating margin of 25% was down 330 basis points primarily due to the impact of lower COVID volume in our biotechnology and diagnostics businesses. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.36 and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now, let’s take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we are seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 16% and core revenue was down 13%. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue growth was in line with our expectations of low single-digits in the first quarter. Flying demand at our large customers, were primarily responsible for therapies in commercial production and later-stage clinical trials remains robust and they are steadily working through inventory they built during the pandemic. Based on our most recent customer conversations, we now expect the inventory normalization process to continue through the second half of the year. During the quarter, we also saw softer demand globally at many of our emerging biotech customers as more pronounced pressures on liquidity and funding accelerated their efforts to conserve capital leading to project delays and cancellations. In consideration of these factors, we anticipate second quarter and full year base business core growth in bioprocessing will be largely consistent with the first quarter. That said these short-term pandemic-related dislocations have not changed our assessment of the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. In fact, there are thousands of biologic therapies currently under development, including more than 750 in Phase 3 clinical trials. With these therapies, our customers are making significant strides in addressing diseases that affect large segments of the population. For example, GLP-1s have become blockbuster treatment for obesity and diabetes and antibody drug conjugates are meaningfully improving treatment outcomes for many types of cancer. And we are also seeing promising developments in the field of Alzheimer’s research where several novel monoclonal antibodies are nearing regulatory approval. Now to best support our customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs, our biotechnology team has been accelerating investments and innovation over the last several years. Cytiva recently introduced the MabSelect VL, a new resin and ligand for bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments. The MabSelect VL’s best-in-class finding capacity and improved alkaline stability makes industrial scale purification more efficient, helping customers improve yields, decrease bioburden and reduced manufacturing costs. This is just one of the innovative solutions from our biotechnology team’s project pipeline aimed at helping customers bring more life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently. Turning to our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 2.5% and core revenue was up 5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business. Our Life Sciences instruments businesses collectively delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth, consistent with our expectations. Funding levels and sales funnels remained healthy across most major geographies and end markets. The demand for our advanced solutions remains strong, notably for recent innovations such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF7600 and Leica Microsystems, Mica. Our genomics consumables business had another quarter of double-digit base business core revenue growth. Robust demand for plasmids, proteins and gene writing and editing solutions was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. During the quarter, Aldevron brought together capabilities from Cytiva and Precision Nanosystems to create a streamlined offering for the development, production and release of mRNA drug substance and drug product. This new offering will be available to customers later this year and is a great example of how we are integrating solutions from across Danaher to create differentiated offerings and deliver even greater value to our customers. Moving to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue declined 10% and core revenue declined 7.5% with double-digit growth in our base business, offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at CES. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth and saw healthy market volumes globally. At Radiometer, strong demand for blood gas testing in China drove double-digit core growth. Leica Biosystems grew mid single-digits, led by advanced staining and digital pathology. Strength across developed markets and China enabled Beckman Coulter Diagnostics to exceed expectations and deliver mid single-digit core growth. On Molecular Diagnostics, broad-based strength across Cepheid’s test menu drove more than 30% core growth in non-respiratory testing. As our customers look for ways to capitalize on the workflow advantages, the Cepheid GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing, they are increasingly adding additional assays from our market leading test menu. This increased menu utilization by our customers helped drive more than 50% growth in infectious disease testing in the first quarter. We also saw good momentum for our recently introduced vaginitis panel, the Xpert Xpress MVP, which contributed to nearly 30% growth in sexual health testing. In COVID-related respiratory testing, customers continued transitioning high throughput testing to the point of care and consolidating their point-of-care PCO testing platforms onto the GeneXpert. As a result, Cepheid’s respiratory testing revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $450 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and the preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. We continue to expect approximately $30 million respiratory tests and $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. Cepheid’s strong results are a testament to the significant value and unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow provides clinicians. Given Cepheid’s leading global installed base and growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market, we are well positioned to help customers meet their testing needs and continue gaining market share for years to come. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 6.5%. Water quality core revenue grew low double-digits and product identification was up low single-digits. In water quality, Hach delivered their fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and ChemTreat was up double-digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. Strength was broad-based across both equipment and consumables, particularly in our industrial end markets. This performance highlights the resilience of the high-margin recurring revenue business model that make up water quality and the significant value our solutions provide in support of customers’ day-to-day mission-critical water operations. At Product Identification, marking and coding was essentially flat, while packaging and color management was up low single-digits. Videojet was up low single-digits despite a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew high single-digits in Q1 last year. Our growth investments are driving a healthy cadence of new product innovation at Videojet. In fact, in March, the team released the 15 ADC continuous inkjet printer the industry’s first dedicated soft pigmented solution. The 15 ADC uses soft pigmented inks to print codes with consistent quality, excellent contrast and strong durability to avoid degradation and fading during production runs, helping customers reduce production downtime. So this is the first of several new product introductions Videojet has planned for the year and is a great example of how our teams are bringing impactful solutions to our customers. In February, we announced that our environmental and applied segment will be named Veralto, when it is launched as a stand-alone company and that it will be headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. This is an exciting milestone for the team, and they are making considerable progress towards becoming a separately traded public company. And we remain on track for our fourth quarter 2023 separation and look forward to sharing more details in the coming months. So now let’s briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26% and which reflects efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our Diagnostics and Biotechnology businesses. Now turning to the full year 2023. Despite the near-term and temporary challenges within bioprocessing, we anticipate mid-single-digit core growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30% and which reflects the previously mentioned efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state. So to wrap up. We’re pleased with our strong first quarter results. Our well-rounded performance is a testament to the durability and balanced positioning of our portfolio and our team’s commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. While the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic state is causing near-term disruption, there is no doubt that the past 3 years have helped shake Danaher into a better, stronger company. We meaningfully changed the scale of our bioprocessing business, with the addition of Cytiva and the creation of the biotechnology group and Cepheid’s expanded installed base that significantly improved their competitive advantage. We’ve also increased our cadence of innovation and strategically deployed capital through M&A, including the acquisition of Aldevron to accelerate our future growth trajectory. So there is a bright future ahead for Danaher, the combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System provide us with a strong foundation to create value for many years to come. And so with that, I’ll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thank you, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
John Bedford: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Ryskin: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. First, I want to start on the bioprocessing inventory challenges. You’ve been dealing with this issue for almost a full year now and you’ve had to revise your outlook lower for fiscal year ‘23 a number of times. Why is the visibility there into inventory is so challenging? And how do you know that this latest view of plus low single digits for the year is the right view and there is not further cuts going down the road?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Michael. Look, undoubtedly, visibility has been choppy here on the way up as COVID tailwinds fueled our growth. And now as we try to drive the soft landing visibility has been impacted. And I would tell you that normally, we have visibility of 9 to 12 months that’s very solid. But it is so that in the last quarters, that has been probably more like 3 to 6 months related to a number of factors. And let me lay some of those factors out for you here, Michael. Sort of starting with the first quarter. So in the first quarter, our base business in bioprocessing grew about 100 basis points, 1%. And if you unpack the growth there, large accounts that are responsible for commercial production and later-stage clinical trials are growing at mid-single digits. So they are burning off inventory. And I’ll come back to that. And then you have sort of emerging biotech and those companies that are more involved in discovery and earlier-stage clinical trial phases, which represent about 20% to 30% of our business and they are down mid-teens. So overall, this is what gets us to this sort of low single-digit growth view for the year. Now let me come back to the larger accounts here for just a second. We see in large biopharma that, in fact, the demand is there, the inventory is burning off, but it is slower than expected. And the reason for that is that we’re starting to see larger pharma companies as well as larger CDMOs replan and recalibrate their own production plans as they start to conserve working capital and cash. And we saw some of that also back in 2016. So we’re seeing larger customers also look at their own finished goods, if you will, inventories and starting to adjust their production plans in order to bring those down as well. So if you then transition over to, again, emerging biotech, so the companies that are working more in discovery and earlier stage. There – we have been observing funding headwinds for, call it, since the second half of the prior year. But those funding headwinds became significantly more pronounced here in the first quarter. And so we’re seeing these accounts looking to conserve cash by prioritizing projects. We see that with lower OpEx and CapEx expenditures, also see a number of layoffs happening in that particular segment. And that’s not just happening in the U.S. We also see that happening in China. And so we’re assuming that barring any other sort of wildcards here, that it doesn’t get significantly worse, but that this continues to play out for the remainder of the year.
Matt McGrew: Mike, it’s Matt. Maybe we could give you a little bit of kind of context around January to kind of the guide in January to where we ended up. I know Rainer sort of mentioned it, but I think it’s important to kind of think about it in the two buckets. So we’ve got the larger biotech – or the larger customers that we’ve got, most of their stuff is sort of Phase 3 clinical on market. In January, our assumption was that, that was going to be kind of, call it, high single-digit growth from those customers. So 70% or so of our customers kind of growing at 7%, 8%. And then kind of the remaining 20%, 25% of the customers, which we’re sort of referring to as emerging biotech, not everything in there is probably technically emerging, but that other piece of the customers in January, we thought that was going to kind of be about low double digits to kind of low teens growth. And you add all that up and that would have been the high single-digit growth that we thought we were going to see here for the year. Like Rainer said, what we saw in Q1 was just, frankly, not that supportive of that kind of ramp as we think about what we would need to build in Q1 and Q2 be able to hit those types of numbers for the full year. And so if you think about what we’re looking at and seeing now in April, those large customers instead of being 7%, 8%, they have been growing still nicely, but more mid-single digits, right? And the big change here is this emerging biotech, another 20%, 25%. And instead of being up kind of mid-teens, they are actually down mid-teens and that comes back to everything that Rainer talked about with people really reprioritizing projects, conserving cash. That happened both in the U.S. and we saw it in China as well. And I think I’d probably say it we saw modest headwinds as we entered the year. And those are just more pronounced now as we move through the quarter. So just as a – to maybe put some numbers to what Reiner said.
Rainer Blair: And then just to reiterate, to support a significant second half ramp, we would start to see that activity level increasing now and in the second quarter. And we’re just not seeing it to the degree that would support that.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks. And on the emerging biotech, just really hope to clarify. Are you seeing that softness in bioprocessing specifically or across in the life sciences segment as well? And then maybe I could transition that to a question on the instrument. You saw 5% growth or mid-single-digit growth in instruments in the first quarter. What’s your expectation for the rest of the year? Any particular pockets of weakness or strength you can call out?
Matt McGrew: Yes, I’ll comment on the bioprocessing broadly speaking, and maybe let Rainer talk about what we’re seeing in tools. The answer is yes. We’re seeing it in both. I would say that we have definitely seen the emerging biotech funding pressures here in the bioprocessing area. I would say we’re seeing it in the tool space or in life sciences as well. I would say that is a lesser portion, obviously, of our revenue. So it’s not quite as big of an impact. But are we seeing – yes, I would say we are seeing customers in those spaces conserving cash on both CapEx and OpEx.
Michael Ryskin: Okay, thanks.
Rainer Blair: So Michael, more generally on the Life Sciences here to your first question. So if we look at Q1, the life sciences based business finished as we thought at high single digits after low double-digit average growth over the last 3 years. And we’ve talked previously about the expected normalization of those growth rates here after having seen that elevated growth for the last 3 years. So that’s right within our expectations. If you look at that geographically, we saw strength in Western Europe and China, in fact, was up double digits on the back of some stimulus there. and North America was a little bit softer. And if you look at Life Sciences, from an end market perspective, large pharma R&D spending levels are still very quite healthy but they are starting to moderate just given the higher comps. And now just connecting the dots to Matt’s commentary here, emerging biotech is impacted by the current funding environment, and we see smaller purchases, if you will, so rather than buying six, four instruments and in other places, really impacted in the less differentiated segments, let’s say. So we are seeing in our own business is not as exposed to that segment in life sciences but we do see it at the margin. And then life science research and academic is holding up well globally for life sciences. So we continue to believe our growth rates moderate to the historical levels in ‘23, and that’s what our value reflects. And that’s not a change to any previous expectations.
Michael Ryskin: Okay, thanks. I will get back in the queue.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Vijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on…
Rainer Blair: Hi, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, Rainer. And congrats on a good start to the year. I guess, just a high-level question on the guidance here, Rainer. All of us are looking at – if I go back 2 months ago, we were assuming back half – perhaps normalization in the industry. And given your comments here on emerging small biotech, that’s where it changes. Is this guidance now be risk because we’re assuming bioprocessing in line with Q1. Are we confident that Q1 was a low point for the year? So just give us some color on the thought process behind the guidance here? I mean, is this now dearest from a back half perspective?
Rainer Blair: So Vijay, I mean, we’re basing our view on the second half. Also based on what we’re seeing in the current market environment, which we just talked about as well as our order book. And like I said a minute ago, in order to support a higher guide for the second half, we need to see different activity levels here in Q1 and Q2. And that’s not the case for two reasons. One, the emerging biotech is quite significantly softer, down mid-teens as we just talked about. And then I would say on the margin, larger accounts are taking a little bit more time to burn through inventory, although they are doing that nicely. And those factors together have us believe unless there is any other sort of significant market disruption that the year will play out much as the first quarter has.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. And then just one on – Cepheid was a bright spot here, 30% growth. I think you made some comments about infectious disease, different testing test being really strong. Can you give us some color on the customers are seeing this ramp? Are these new customers that bought a Cepheid system during the pandemic, I am just trying to think how sustainable is that 30% growth in sort of related one here on M&A, some chatter about Danaher on the M&A side. Would Danaher be interested in getting into services? Or how should – maybe just remind us on the M&A lens and criteria that Danaher processes that pipeline?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So Vijay, on the Cepheid question, we’re really seeing a broad-based usage of the infectious disease menu. In fact, our broader menu in general, both at our existing installed base that’s been there for some time as well as with our newer customers as they start transitioning that COVID testing capacity that they have to take full advantage of that menu. So we see that 30% here as a good marker of how people appreciate the workflow advantages, the ease of use and the accuracy of the platform. Remember, we’re seeing two factors here. One, we see test transitioning from high throughput environment into the point of care on the one hand. And on the other hand, we see expanded usage of our testing menu.
Matt McGrew: Yes, Vijay, maybe just to kind of – to put a real-life example to that, I think. So if you think about what we’re seeing, we’ve got customers – existing customers today, we kind of goes both ways, right? So we’ve got existing customers today that, for example, will use Group A Strep. And those customers now sort of are also moving everything over to the four to one or to COVID as well. And then you’ve got the other way, which is that sort of installed base going from kind of 2x growth here over the last 3 years. You have got people who have used these systems now for many, many years. And what they are doing is they are starting to bring in new menu and that new menu has been around infectious disease first, which is primarily right now, were largely Group A Strep. So, you are kind of having somebody who used the box throughout COVID testing, using it on for COVID four-and-one, and stand-alone. And now they are bringing on Group A Strep as well. And so that’s what we always kind of talked about with COVID being an anchor assay as we go forward, larger installed base, anchor assay, now you move into infectious disease, there will be other opportunities to pull in sort of other menu as we go forward. But that’s exactly the type of thing we are seeing play out here. And that’s – it is encouraging. Early days yet, I mean and also still some lower base these are off of lower numbers. But as we go forward, we have sort of talked about next year and the longer term. That’s why I think that installed base growth was so important because we have got the menu, be able to pull through and then the additions of the new menu are going to be only helpful on that larger installed base.
Rainer Blair: So, on M&A, Vijay, obviously we don’t comment on chatter. But what I would tell you is we really like the way we are positioned. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Valuations continue to moderate, perhaps the one or the other Board is not quite there yet, but we do see more realism in the many discussions that we have across the board as always. And specifically, as we have said in the past should our customers tag on this and on our help and services, that’s not something that we are going to ignore. But once again, that’s just one of several opportunities. I think the most important thing to remember is that we are not going to deviate from our disciplined approach. It’s got to be the right end market. It’s got to be the right target and the model has to work. And it’s when those three lights flip green that we execute.
Matt McGrew: Yes. I think Vijay, too, I mean I think as we sit here, I think it’s – not saying this is ‘08, ‘09, but having a balance sheet that we have got right now and being able to kind of be flexible, I think is important in times like these because as Rainer said, when the market company valuation all line up, we are ready to go. But we do need to see all three of those. And as things get a little choppier here as they might get a little job here, I think I really like how we are kind of set up here from a balance sheet perspective as well.
Vijay Kumar: Thanks Matt.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Vijay.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Scott.
Scott Davis: Hey. Good morning guys. Rainer, Matt, and John good morning. Rainer, you have said – you made a reference in your prepared remarks to kind of incremental cost-out. I think I probably asked this question last quarter. But can you give us a little bit of granularity or color at least on what you are talking about? Is there a structural cost-out? Is it more of just taking out some of that – some of those kind of temporary costs that came in during COVID that now are unnecessary, or is there an actual attempt to go after some of the structural costs that perhaps you couldn’t have gone after before?
Matt McGrew: Yes. Scott, maybe I will take a crack at it. Yes, like we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are sort of going from an adjusted OP – adjusted operating margins of 31 in our previous guide to 30. And I think the way to think about it is sort of twofold, half of that is just the volume, right. Like – and most of that is all of that activities in bioprocessing. But the other half is capacity reduction costs. I would say that that’s going to be two places. It’s going to be in biotechnology and then as importantly, and more importantly, probably at Cepheid. Like you said, we have always sort of known we were going to get to an inflection point here at some point where we were sort of making the call that we have moved into an endemic phase. And once we moved into an endemic phase, we were going to need to bring some of the capacity that we have been running at it Cepheid down. And so I think just as a reminder, in Q4 last year, we did 20 million respiratory tests, and that was only three months ago. But I think you have really seen a tail off here as we have entered into the last couple of months. And I think our team is pretty clear that we are now kind of entering a new phase of volumes that we will need. And so we are going to be getting after some of that. And I think what does that look like, it’s talking about closing and consolidating some of the plants that we have got. Some of those were frankly put up quickly in locations that were not ideal for the longer term because we are trying to meet the needs of a pandemic. So, we are going to get after a couple of those sites. We are going to reduce some of the headcount and then we are going to go after indirect and fixed overhead costs as well, reducing shifts, etcetera, etcetera. So, those are the types of things we are going to be going after here. That’s largely going to be in the second quarter and third quarter is when you are going to see the costs sort of roll through. So, you will see that in the margin in those two quarters and then to sort of pop back a little bit. And then maybe just to give you some sense of what’s that look like in – once we are done with that kind of in Q4 and as we head into ‘24, Scott, I think Cepheid in 2019 was a 20% to 25% OP business, during the peak of the pandemic here, it probably was north of 45%. And after we get through what we are going to do in the next couple of quarters, like I have said on the capacity reduction side, starting kind of in Q4 and heading into ‘24, they are going to be 35% to 40% margin, right. So, meaningfully up from where we were given the volumes that we have now, it’s a much bigger business, but not quite at the peak pandemic where I was getting a lot of volume leverage, but that gives you a sense of what we are going after, what we are trying to do and where we end up on the other side.
Scott Davis: That’s super helpful, Matt. Can you guys just remind us what – where is your – the size of their installed base in Cepheid today versus pre-COVID, I know I have – I am sure having the note somewhere, but to just make a little easier on...?
Matt McGrew: Yes. 2x, Scott, we are about 50,000 today. Started probably like 2019.
Scott Davis: Alright. Perfect. I will pass it on. Thank you, guys. Good luck this year.
Matt McGrew: Yes.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Scott.
Operator: We will take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Dan.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the questions guys. Maybe just one on bioprocess to start out, just – could you help us think through like what is the magnitude of that destock drag that’s kind of baked in guidance? I know you gave a lot of color earlier in the Q&A. And then related to that, or emerging bio, it’s certainly a bigger group than we thought as a percentage of that segment. Any color kind of what that grew in ‘22 and kind of the quick math to get to low single for the year? If it’s 30% of revenues, I guess you are assuming some improvement there because if we kept it down 15%, I don’t think we would get to up low single for the year.
Matt McGrew: Yes. So, maybe – again, maybe the way to think about it, Dan, is that sort of the larger customers that are really where we are seeing the inventory drag. That was sort of – we initially thought we would see that in the high-single digits, call it, 7%, 8%, and that’s a little bit lower now, call it, 6% and change. And so I think the inventory destocking is flowing through in the larger customers, and you are seeing it at a slightly lower growth rate that we saw in Q1 and we are expecting them to see for the full year. So, that’s how I would sort of frame what the inventory destocking is. The rest is really, like I talked about earlier, emerging biotech and sort of the other 25% of our customers, we thought that, that would be a low teens type growth rate here for the year. Combine that with the 8% that we thought we would see in the larger, that’s how we get to high-single digits. That low teens is actually negative mid-teens, right, with all the pressures we talked about. So, I would say that we are just sort of assuming that that type of growth rate for the rest of the year for that customer base and that we are going to have – the larger customers will be more in the mid-single digit like I talked about. That’s what we are kind of assuming for the year. And based entirely on what we saw in Q1, the order book in Q1 sort of not being supportive, frankly, of, in our minds, at least, the ability with the limited visibility we have or more limited visibility, just not supportive of being able to say that we think we can get back to high-single digits. I think you asked a question of what those customers were there last year. That entire business largely was up in line with what we saw last year, which is as you remember, mid to high 20s. So, kind of you sort of look at mid to high-20s with that group of folks, now they are sort of down mid-teens, still a very solid growth on a 2-year basis, but it is what we are seeing right now.
Dan Brennan: Got it. And then thanks Matt. And then may be on the margins and the earnings, so we are coming out somewhere kind of $925 million, $930 million for the year. Just wondering if you guys – you kind of put the pieces together. Is that kind of the rates of code? And given the cost actions you are taking this year, does that set yourself up in ‘24 for like potentially higher than normal operating leverage, depending on what the top line comes in at?
Matt McGrew: Yes. No, I mean I think if you are going through the full year, the math is what it is at around 30% adjusted OP margins, I think sort of that takes care of itself. As far as what we are going to look like as we sort of get to the other side of this. I mean I talked a little bit about Cepheid kind of was 20% to 25% pre-pandemic, peaked up at 45% and 35% to 40%. I mean I think if you sort of use that frame plus what we have in diagnostics, that sort of gets you where we think roughly the margin profile will be. Biotech is probably the other one after we get through some of these costs. The same math there was biotech was, call it, high 30s prior to the pandemic. Again, it peaked at around, call it, 45% and change. And after we sort of get through what I think we are going to do there, they are probably going to be more like low-40s. So, again better than they were pre-pandemic given the fact that they are a bigger business. But those two pieces, I think you can slide into what ‘24 might look like. And then life sciences, that should be kind of plus or minus where we have been here. That has not been a margin that’s moved around quite a bit. A little bit of COVID stuff as we had in ‘22 and ‘21, but I think you can kind of get a sense of what the margins are there. So, maybe it’s just a high-level framework, you are probably high-30s, low-40s with Cepheid, you can kind of assume some other stuff for the diagnostics, biotech, probably low-40s than what we are seeing in LS. But we will obviously sort of come back to that later, still pretty early in ‘23, but just to give you a very high level view.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks Matt. Thanks guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Dan.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Jack.
Jack Meehan: Thanks. Good morning. Another question on bioprocessing. Can you share what was your total order rate in the quarter? Is there any color you can just share around how the quarter played out? Have things weakened throughout the quarter. Just curious about how things are trending.
Rainer Blair: Sure, Jack. So, once again, first quarter, our orders were down modestly sequentially. So, relative to the fourth quarter, down modestly. But year-over-year, they declined 20%, okay. And so what we have been seeing is the inventory burn down that we have been talking about Matt and myself, is occurring, and we see that in our order book here for the first quarter. And then again, we have laid out why we believe that the current activity level supports sort of a similar progression of the quarters here throughout the year as we had in the first quarter.
Jack Meehan: Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I was curious what impact, if any, did you see from the banking crisis, which took place in the quarter. I understand you probably didn’t have any direct exposure to that, but how are your customers reacting sort of across the business?
Rainer Blair: Right. So, direct exposure was not material in any sense of the word. As it relates to the impact on our businesses, particularly in bioprocessing, to a much lesser extent in life sciences, we do think that, that provides that additional inflection point here in the first quarter for liquidity tightening up and that prioritization that we are seeing here in the emerging biotech segment, call it emerging biotech, and once again, those companies working on earlier stage projects. So, that’s where we have seen a more pronounced conservation of cash and that plays out in OpEx, CapEx and you can – and we talked about how that played out with mid-teens contraction as opposed to sort of a mid-teens growth versus prior periods.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Jack.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Rachel.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions you guys. And so I appreciate all the comments that you have given on emerging biotech softness in bioprocessing with that customer set really down mid-teens in 1Q. So first, just a clarifying question. Did you say that you expect that emerging biotech to remain at mid-teen declines for the year? And then kind of shifting more longer term, can you talk about your assumptions around when you expect emerging biotech to return to growth? And at what point can this funding issue really pressure the long-term growth outlook for the bioprocessing market?
Rainer Blair: So, just to confirm on the topic of emerging biotech, our assumption is and our guide reflects that the activity level in emerging biotech stays for the remainder of the year as it played out in the first quarter. So, we are not assuming any change there including that it doesn’t get significantly worse. Now, as it relates to how that segment progresses here, that’s from today’s point of view, hard to predict. We need to see where capital markets go, liquidity availability and yes, a stabilization and return to some degree of normality in the banking sector. But for the visibility that we have today, we are not expecting an improvement in that segment for the remainder of the year.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Got it. And then maybe a few questions on China here. So, one of your peers recently signed China bioprocessing, I think you also mentioned that in one of your answers to earlier question. So, can you talk about how did bioprocessing performed during 1Q in China? And can you just give us some context of how big China is for bioprocessing for Danaher? Looking forward, how are those orders trending within China, specifically around some of the localized manufacturers. And then last question, just stepping back, you previously had guided to low-single digit growth for China for the year. 1Q was well above expectations. So, what’s the total co-outlook for China? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Well, as it relates to bioprocessing in China, we have had a very good and strong business there in China for years. And it helped quite significantly in China in order to build the capacity for vaccines and for other biologics. And what we see today, much like we have seen in the U.S. is that the Emerging Biotech segment, which is an important part of China’s efforts to build a local biopharma industry is also impacted by capital constraints. So, we have seen that play out in China as well. And in fact, that’s what is the primary impact on our China numbers here. In the first quarter, which on the whole were better than expected, primarily because of the patient volumes and the diagnostic businesses being stronger. Now, as it relates to the full year in China, we expect our full year in China to be up low-single digits for Danaher overall based on the market recovery, exiting COVID as well as, if you will, a normalization of the activity level in bioprocessing.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thank you, Rachel.
Operator: Thank you. And I will turn it over to the speakers for closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thank you, Ashley. I appreciate everyone for joining us on the call today. We will be around all day and rest of the week for the follow-ups.

Rainer Blair: Thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our terrific fourth quarter results rounded out another great year for Danaher. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove nearly 10% core growth, strong earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits for the year and has now grown high single digits or better each of the last 10 quarters.  Our well-rounded results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 80,000 associates. The team overcame global supply chain challenges, logistics delays, COVID-driven lockdowns and inflationary pressures to reliably support our customers. We believe the DBS-driven execution, coupled with our proactive growth investments over the last several years contributed to meaningful market share gains in many of our businesses. Now looking to 2023 and beyond, we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. Our portfolio is made up of leading franchises of durable business models and attractive end markets that benefit from outstanding long-term secular growth drivers. We're well positioned financially with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet capacity, allowing us to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. So this unique combination of leading businesses and financial strength all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates us and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2022 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth, including 8% core revenue growth in our base business. We also expanded our core operating margins by 60 basis points and generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100% for the 31st consecutive year. Our strong financial results allowed us to continue our cadence of high impact growth investments throughout the year. In fact, our investments in research and development of more than $1.7 billion in 2022 enabled us to accelerate innovation across Danaher. New products such as the Leica Microsystems, Beacon, Leica Biosystems automated advanced staining platform, Bond Prime; and Hach's Headquarter series portable meters are helping improve both human health and the environment, while enhancing our growth trajectory.  Our capital expenditures of over $1 billion included substantial investments to expand production capacity in our bioprocessing and genomics businesses. These investments have been critical to support current customer demand but they're equally important to support the long-term growth opportunities and security of supply in these markets. With several of our customers' biologic therapies progressing through the regulatory approval process, we anticipate the size of our bioprocessing and genomics businesses to increase meaningfully here in the coming years. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $8.4 billion, and we delivered 7.5% core revenue growth. Our base business core revenue growth was also 7.5% as our core revenue growth contribution from COVID-19 testing was neutral year-over-year. Geographically, core revenue growth in both North America and Western Europe was approximately 10%. We saw healthy demand across our major end markets with customer activity and funding levels largely consistent with the third quarter. High-growth markets core revenue was up slightly. China grew low single digits, driven by robust demand in our life sciences instruments and acute care diagnostic businesses. However, the reopening efforts associated with the ending of zero COVID policies and subsequent increase in COVID-19 infections resulted in reduced patients and testing volumes in our clinical diagnostics business. We anticipate lower testing volumes to continue through the first quarter of 2023 before gradually recovering through the balance of the year. Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%, and our operating margin of 27.4% was up 100 basis points, including 105 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This strong margin performance was enabled by the disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions our teams implemented to help offset the impact of inflationary pressures across our business. While there continue to be supply chain disruptions and cost pressures, we saw a modest improvement in component availability again this year and this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.87 was up 6.5% versus last year, and we also generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to point out some updates we've made in our financial reporting. Due to changes in our organization resulting from the significant growth of our Life Sciences segment over the past several years, we have separated our former Life Science segment into two new reporting segments. Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, which include bioprocessing and our discovery and medical businesses are now reported as the biotechnology segment. Our new life sciences segment is comprised of the remainder of the businesses in our former life sciences segment. The Diagnostics and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments are unchanged. Importantly, today's discussion reflects these changes. So now let's take a look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 1% and core revenue was up 4%. In bioprocessing, robust customer activity across monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapies and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, drove another quarter of more than 20% growth in non-COVID revenue.  Total core growth in bioprocessing was mid-single digits for the fourth quarter as customers continue to scale back their COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs. For the full year 2022, core revenue growth in bioprocessing was high single digits, which included non-COVID revenue growth of more than 20%. Looking to 2023, we expect customers to further reduce their COVID-19-related programs. Vaccination and booster rates have been significantly lower than initially anticipated and the availability of alternative therapeutics has reduced the need for monoclonal antibody-based treatment. In light of these dynamics, we now anticipate COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue will be approximately $150 million for the full year of 2023, down from approximately $800 million in 2022 and lower than our previous expectation of $500 million. Our non-COVID business has averaged more than 20% growth over the past two years. Given these elevated growth rates, we spent the past several weeks speaking with our customers to better understand their planning assumptions for 2023. And based on these discussions, we anticipate non-COVID bioprocessing core growth will be high single digits for the full year 2023. This includes low single-digit core growth in the first quarter as customers repurpose inventory purchased for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs to non-COVID projects. Now there is a bright future ahead for the biologics market and our leading bioprocessing business. The number of biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise, and we expect to see significant industry-wide investments in research, development and production capacity well into the future. With our differentiated portfolio, which is the broadest and deepest in the industry across upstream and downstream applications, our best-in-class scientific services and extensive global reach, we're exceptionally well positioned to support our customers as they undertake this complex life-changing work. Now moving to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 8%, and core revenue was up 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments and consumables with all major businesses delivering high single-digit or better core revenue growth. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Demand remains solid across our major geographies and end markets, and we're seeing good momentum in our opportunity funnels as we begin the new year. Our genomics consumables businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, driven by strong demand for our plasmas, RNA and gene lighting and editing solutions. During the quarter, IDT strengthened its next-generation sequencing portfolio with the acquisition of Archer DX NGS assays. These assays are foundational in researching novel cancer fusions and bring new capabilities, including an enhanced bioinformatics platform to expand IDT's suite of sequencing solutions. Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 3% and core revenue grew 7.5%, led by mid-teens growth at Cepheid. Radiometer grew double digits, led primarily by demand for blood gas testing in China. Leica Biosystems was also up double digits with growth across all major product lines. In our digital pathology business, we saw record placements of the GT 450, Leica's best-in-class digital pathology slide scanner, as customers are increasingly realizing the operational and clinical benefits of digitization. In Molecular Diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's non-respiratory chest menu grew more than 20% led by infectious disease testing, sexual health and hospital-acquired infections. The acceleration in growth this quarter was due in part to increased adoption of Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu across our nearly 50,000 instruments installed base, which has doubled since 2020. During the quarter, Cepheid expanded their competitively advantaged test menu with the launch of the Xpert Express MVP. The Express MVP rapidly diagnoses three distinct health conditions that cause overlapping vaginitis symptoms in women using a single sample. This addition to our sexual health portfolio enables physicians to quickly diagnose the patient's infection and prescribe a targeted treatment regimen, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing closer to patients is improving health care outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid. In respiratory testing, global PCR testing volumes continued to moderate. The demand for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR testing remained robust. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter significantly exceeded our expectation of approximately $375 million. The respiratory season got off to an earlier-than-anticipated start with a high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19, flu and RSV leading to both higher volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A&B and RSV. Now based on discussions with our customers, we believe COVID-19 will enter an endemic disease state in 2023, and as a result, expect to ship 30 million respiratory tests and generate $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. As hospitals and health systems begin planning for their endemic testing needs, we're increasingly seeing customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms on to Cepheid's GeneXpert. Our customers' preference for the GeneXpert for both respiratory and non-respiratory testing is a result of the significant value of the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and a best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. The combination of these advantages, the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market and our leading global installed base creates significant opportunities ahead for Cepheid's point-of-care solutions. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 1% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Water quality core revenue growth was high single digits and product identification was flat. At product identification, marking and coding was up slightly while packaging and color management was down low single digits. Core revenue at Videojet was up slightly due in part to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q4 last year. In December, Pantone announced Viva Magenta as the 2023 Color of the Year. The color of the year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit full year core revenue growth in X-Rite [ph] color standards business in 2022. In water quality, Hach delivered their third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. ChemTreat was also up double digits in the fourth quarter, capping its 54th consecutive year of growth, a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class execution and their commitment to continuous improvement. During the quarter, demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remained strong across municipal and industrial end markets, but we did see a slight moderation of larger project activity at Trojan. Throughout the year, our teams and EAS did a great job leveraging the Danaher Business System to overcome supply chain challenges and manage inflationary pressures. They were at the forefront of identifying potential constraints and quickly deployed DBS tools like daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production part availability. They also use visual project management to rapidly reengineer products and to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components. Also, strong price performance helped the team expand operating profit margins by more than 80 basis points in 2022, while continuing their cadence of growth investments. We believe this outstanding execution paired with our proactive growth investments drove market share gains and enhanced our long-term competitive advantage in both product identification and water quality. So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and the full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we are updating our base business core revenue growth definition to exclude the impact of COVID-19-related testing and the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue.  In the first quarter, we expect core revenue growth in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. Now for the full year 2023. We expect high single-digit core growth in our base business. And we also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 31%. So to wrap up, 2022 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to reliably support our customers and deliver outstanding financial results, all while investing for the future. As we look ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform well into the future. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Todd, we're now ready to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: Hey, good morning. And thank you for taking my question. So, a couple of questions to start. I guess the first one would be just on the inventory situation and sort of like how we should think about that working through and just sort of your expectations on the bioprocessing front on the non-COVID bioprocessing. Just some sense of timing. Is this a 1Q, 2Q phenomenon? Just general thoughts there.
Rainer Blair: Derik, as it relates to the inventory situation, let's think about sort of our Q1 guide here as a starting point and the context for that. We expect for our overall guide to have a base business growth of mid-single digits, and we expect COVID testing, including now vaccine and therapeutics to have high single-digit and low double-digit headwind, giving us that decline of mid-single digits in the first quarter. Now let me come back to the base business because, of course, that's where your question resides. And once more, we have to be clear that we have now excluded vaccine and therapeutic revenues from the base business, right? So our mid-single-digit base business is down from the comparable low double-digit core growth we saw in Q4 and most of 2022. And that's due mainly to bioprocessing, ex-COVID, and I want to dig into that a little bit, but also because we're expecting lower patient volumes here in China as zero COVID policies are ended. So that's what's happening there in that base business in Q1. Now if we look, and we dig in a little bit deeper into bioprocessing, we anticipate that our non-COVID bioprocessing business will be low single digits, and that's really for two reasons. One, we're coming off of 30% growth in Q1 of 2022. But we're also working through the inventory pockets that we spoke about that was related primarily to COVID programs. And we do expect Q1 to be an inflection point there that we work through the majority of that in Q1 and then after that, continue to see improvement.
Derik De Bruin: Got it. Okay. And I have to ask the obligatory analytical instrumentation demand, SCIEX demand coming off of some really strong growth this year. What are your sort of expectations on instruments? And I would expect you would see some slowdown in the back half of the year is embedded in your numbers.
Rainer Blair: I think that reflects our perspective. We saw low double-digit plus core growth in our instrument businesses here in 2022 and believe that we definitely took share there. And frankly our funnels are still very strong here going into the new year. But as we look to the total year, we would expect that low double-digit plus to moderate to the more normal growth of mid-single digit plus certainly towards the back end of the year.
Derik De Bruin: And what's embedded in sort of like an overall pricing expectation just to get your sense of...
Rainer Blair: So as you know, in the fourth quarter on pricing, Derik, we came in over 400 basis points, with the teams really executing very well. And that represents roughly where we were for all of 2022. As we look forward then into 2023, we continue to expect some cost pressures there, and we'll look to have pricing of 200 to 300 basis points, probably closer to 300 basis points.
Matthew McGrew: Derik, that's for total Danaher, not just instruments. 
Derik De Bruin: Yes. Okay. Got it. Got it. Like that. Okay. I think I'll get back in the queue. I've got some other ones where I need to digest some stuff, but thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Derik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Rachel.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Good morning. So first up, just on China. So you mentioned that you're expecting some softness there. Can you just dig a little bit deeper, how much of the softness on that 1Q is going to be pressured there? And then what do you expect for China in total for the year as well? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: So as I mentioned, China is -- and of course, everybody knows coming out of the zero COVID lockdowns and that's affecting patient volumes here. And we saw that in December, in particular, and have taken that as an indicator for how we should think about the first quarter in China, which we expect to be down around high single digits here in the first quarter, but then moderating as the Chinese population gets through sort of the various infection waves that are expected. And we expect that patient volumes then improve throughout the year and are expecting low single digits for the full year in China.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned that Western Europe was 10% core during 4Q. Can you just talk about your expectations for Europe with this year? Have you seen any softness related to any budget constraints on your conversations with customers there? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: I would tell you, if we think about non-COVID, we continue to see good demand in Western Europe. We have seen the cycle time of deals. So that period of time between lead, capture and capturing the order extending here in the fourth quarter, and we would expect that to continue. As you think about Western Europe, including COVID headwinds, we would expect that to be flat here in the first quarter and then up low single digits. But once again, that includes some COVID headwinds.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Helpful. And then final question for me, just around bioprocessing. Can you just walk us through kind of the order book and how book-to-bill has trended within bioprocessing given some of the puts and takes there getting us to that low single digits in the first quarter and rounding out the year at high single digits on the non-COVID side?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So as it relates to orders, and I talked about this in the past as well as book-to-bill. In fact, we don't really look at book-to-bill for the bioprocessing business because it may not be the best way, and we don't think it is the best way to really understand the underlying health of the business, particularly given the extended lead times that we had here in the prior period. So we've been looking at orders really on a two to three-year horizon to take out the lumpiness as well as the extended lead times. And over the last three years, really, both orders and revenues have grown at a mid-single teens average rate. Now from a current trend perspective, in the fourth quarter, our order rate improved by over 500 basis points sequentially but was still down mid-teens, which was as expected as customers continue to adjust for our shorter lead times.  Now to be clear, our full year 2023 guide anticipates Q1 being the low point at low single digits for the bioprocessing non-COVID core growth. And that also takes account to any inventories that might be with some of our COVID program customers, which are now being repurposed. We're working with those customers to repurpose that inventory. So whatever these order dynamics are revenue forecast for bioprocessing non-COVID in first quarter low single digits, we expect that to be the low point of the inventory work off or burn off and then move forward to what is high single-digit bioprocessing, non-COVID core growth for the full year.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking my question. So I had my first question on bioprocessing here just about clarify some of these numbers here. I think a couple of months ago, Rainer, I think the expectation was for base bioprocessing, anywhere from high singles to teens. When you look at the high single, if it's at the low end of the range, did anything change? And when I think about that cadence throughout the year, I think first half is somewhere in the mid-single digits imply second half and double-digit range. Is there any risk out there in the back half? What gives you the visibility in the back half activation [ph] bioprocessing?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay. So as early as the JPMorgan conference, we did talk about the bioprocessing growth range being from high single digits to mid-teens range. And as I mentioned then, and I'll confirm now, we have spent the last several weeks talking to our customers to understand their planning assumptions for the year. And the clear message is the underlying demand remains robust and unchanged. So we continue to see monoclonal antibodies, cell therapy and gene therapy activity continue to be strong, and we're even seeing more work on mRNA on the back of its success with COVID vaccine. So while the demand is remaining solid, customers are actually not anticipating a step-up in activity. So activity remains strong and as we've seen in prior quarters, but they're not anticipating a step-up versus what we've seen here in the last couple of years. And so as you look at the two, three, even four year stacks here, we've seen mid-teens growth CAGRs for bioprocessing non-COVID. So coming back then, if you take our high single-digit bioprocessing non-COVID full year guide on the back of an approximately 30% comp from 2022, it's right in the mid-teens range, both on a two and a three-year basis. So we think that's especially strong in light of the fact that in Q1, we do expect to burn off some inventory and will start low single digits. And in fact, if we had assumed the mid-teens to the higher part of the range for '23, that actually would have implied an acceleration of demand to over 20% on a two-year stack. And frankly, that's just not supported by our customer discussions.  So as we think about burning off these inventories, you asked about the confidence in the later part of the year, and that confidence is based on our discussions with customers, the backlog that we have, the continued order activity that we see and that has improved over prior periods. And so we feel very good about the high single digits non-COVID bioprocessing growth for 2023.
Matthew McGrew: And maybe, Vijay, just to give you a bit -- sorry, yes. Just to give you kind of numbers to it because I know we've talked about this a lot recently, just so that we kind of repeated here. If you look at bioprocessing, ex-COVID growth, right, over the last four years, inclusive of our '23 guide, you have 7%, 8% type growth in 2020 as we are sort of moving into and away from the core bioprocessing doing more COVID work. And then in 2021 and 2022, we grew, ex-COVID, 20% plus in each of those two years. And so now this year in '23, the high single-digit guide, it's sort of kind of an inverse barbell, if you will. But if you look at kind of high single digits to start in '20, high single digits as we get through the last of COVID in '23 with 20% and 25% growth in the middle in '21 and '22, that's sort of the period that we're looking back and over because I don't think you can look at just any one period or quarter, given everything Rainer said that happened in '21 and '22 with the extended lead times and what was happening with COVID. So just so that we're all on the same page on sort of the numbers historically on how we have sort of arrived at that mid-teens growth rate in discussion with our customers who say, Hey, look, if you look back over the last three, four years, my demand is about the same. My order pattern is going to be slightly different, but my end demand is about the same.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful color and perspective. And then one last question here for me, perhaps, Matt, this is you. The high single-digit guide for bioprocessing implies like the non-bioprocessing that's nearly 75% of Danaher revenues. That's also up high singles. That's a strong number. Again, any confidence here? I think there's been some concerns around capital order trends. So what's the order book shaping up for instruments? And margins here, 31% that's stepped down from Q4. Given that high single digits will resume and the pricing commentary, your volume leverage and pricing contribution should be pretty strong. So maybe if you could just comment on the non-bioprocessing high single-digit assumptions and margin assumptions?
Matthew McGrew: Let me take margins. And I think we sort of covered the high-single digits bit, but maybe Rainer can kind of wrap it up on bioprocessing.
Vijay Kumar: I'm sorry, non-bioprocessing, non-bioprocessing.
Matthew McGrew: Non-bioprocessing. I'm sorry. So COVID?
Vijay Kumar: No, no. Ex-bioprocessing, the other EAS diagnostics. I mean...
Matthew McGrew: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Everything outside of bioprocessing. Got you. So let me start with the margin question first because I think that's one that's topical here, too. So if you think about margins for the full year, and then I can kind of touch on '21 or Q1 as well. When you look at margins, we're talking about kind of 31% adjusted margin. And that's going to be a bit lower than we were in '23 on the margin, if you will, with the biggest factor going to be the value of leverage, like you alluded to there. We're going to lose, call it, $3.2 billion of COVID headwinds in the year, $700 million from the vaccines and therapeutics as we go from, call it, $800 million to a little over $150 million or a little under $150 million. And then we're going to have $2.5 billion of testing follow-up as we think we get to a more endemic state on Cepheid testing. So the margin profile on that stuff on the headwinds is basically the fleet average. I'd say that probably falls through at 40%. So kind of in line with our normal fall through, but that volume is pretty meaningful at $3.2 billion as you talked about. So we will offset some of that. High single-digit core and base business is going to be $1.7 billion in change, let's call it, falling through 35% to 40%, but just not enough to fully compensate what's happening with our COVID headwinds here.  So I think you combine that the volume with sort of an overall macro backdrop, Vijay, that I still want to kind of be prudent here from a planning perspective as we head into the year. I want to see how the inflation of the supply chain kind of progresses through the year. China is still a bit of an unknown on how that bounces back. And I kind of I like to start the year with cost structure that's in the right place, and let's see how some of these things sort of play out. And as the year goes on, we'll obviously try to do better, but that's sort of how I'm kind of thinking about the margin for the year. And really, the only difference between Q1 and Q2 from 31% for the full year -- I'm sorry, in Q1, is FX in the first quarter. That's it. We'll have a $225 million FX headwind in Q1. And so, I would say that the same drivers, if you will, for the full year are for Q1.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful.
Rainer Blair: And then Vijay, just coming back to your question regarding the base business without Biotechnology growth here for 2023. We talked about Life Sciences instruments going from the low double digits or to the mid-single-digit plus here as we expect that to moderate during the course of the year. But in our Life Science businesses, we also have our genomics businesses, which are growing at double digits. So when you look at our under the new definition, Life Sciences business, so that would be the instrument businesses and genomics businesses, we expect high single-digit growth for the year. As it relates to our Diagnostics business, without COVID testing, we also expect high single-digit growth there, if you think about the growth in Leica Biosystems, Radiometer and as patient volumes normalize, supported also by solid growth at Beckman diagnostics, once again without COVID testing high single digits. And then as it relates to EAS, we would expect that now to normalize after having had just banner growth here in the last couple of years to be more the low to mid-single-digit growth, probably skewed more to mid-single digits for the year.
Vijay Kumar: That’s extremely helpful, Rainer. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys. Lots of detail already discussed here, so I'll try to go back to a little bigger picture. What assumptions are you guys using for kind of labor and material inflation for 2023? I assume this is mitigated a little bit from the high labor inflation you've had the last couple of years, but curious on your view there?
Matthew McGrew: Yes, Scott. I think when I think about price cost, kind of back to that 200 to 300 basis points of price, we have been positive on price/cost the last, I guess, year here and probably a little bit more. So I think we -- that guide of 200 to 300 basis points would keep us at positive price cost. We are seeing -- I would say that we're seeing some things from a supply chain pressure come down. Freight lanes is probably the one the biggest one that I can think of from a cost perspective. I would tell you that other parts of the supply chain, we probably are seeing availability be better but not necessarily seeing costs come down yet. So I think we're sort of still in that 200 to 300 basis points of price to help offset what is still out there, but there are early signs of things may be turning.
Scott Davis: Is that price, Matt, is that pretty much already out in the system? Or is that still to be...
Matthew McGrew: No. No, it's out. Yes, it's already out there. If we need to if we need to -- we can go for more as we've done here, Scott, and you saw that as we built through the year this year.
Scott Davis: And can you guys remind us what are the remaining steps you need for the EAS separation? Is there any kind of upside to getting that done on the earlier than planned?
Matthew McGrew: I'd love to say that it's easy to do, but there's quite a bit of work to get through it, Scott. I mean we've got -- we're still in the early days of the audits, getting the audits done. And after that, we've got a lot of org work, obviously, to do and a whole work stream of people who are working on it. I think we are still very much on track for Q4, the ability to do something here in Q4. Anything earlier, I think just between the audits, the work that remains and the tax ruling, it just takes time for these. So I don't think that's probably a base case scenario for us right now, Scott. I still think Q4 is the way to think about it.
Scott Davis: Okay. I’ll pass it on. Thank you, guys and best of luck in '23.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with Cowen.
Dan Brennan: Great. Good morning, Rainer, good morning, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first one would just be on China. I know there was a question asked earlier, but just wondering, some peers have commented that obviously, there's a headwind right now as the COVID rates have spiked but that as the year plays out, you could see China actually turned out to be stronger than maybe you were -- than peers were anticipating, excuse me, given the benefits on the economy. So kind of what are you assuming in that low single? Is that -- do you think you need some cushion in there? Or just how do you contemplate China playing out for the year given the change of policy?
Rainer Blair: Dan, so -- I mean, the near term, just to recap is, in fact, that we saw, particularly in our Diagnostics business, lower patient volumes related to the hospitals in China being overwhelmed with COVID-infected patients. And we expect that to continue here in the Q1. It's currently the Lunar New Year holiday, where we expect infections to spread here in the next 30 days or so. And then over time, that, that would start waning, reducing. With -- it's kind of unknown as to how many other waves follow that. But we do believe that during the course of the year, especially as it relates to our business, patient volumes start recovering. We've seen this again and again after severe lockdowns of large cities in the previous years. And so we expect that to be pretty resilient. And that's why we end up then with a full year China guide of low single digits. Now could there be upside? Potentially. There's clearly some pent-up demand in the Chinese economy. And it just depends now on how quickly people can get back to work and some normalcy returns to the markets in general. So we think from where we sit today, low single digits for the full year is a good way to think about it. And of course, we'll continue to update as we go through the year here. But it's a good starting point, and there may be some upside should in fact that pent-up demand be released here in 2023.
Dan Brennan: Great. And then just on the M&A environment. We've heard some commentary in kind of recent weeks that there seems to be a more willing seller environment, maybe just a reflection of macro and interest rates. So there seems to be maybe more folks coming to the table. How would you characterize obviously, it's impossible to time M&A, but how would you characterize the current environment? And just any color in terms of the outlook, whether it be from private targets or public targets and obviously, I'm sure all the remaining businesses post the EAS spin, EAS and excuse me, are candidates for M&A, but just how would you characterize kind of the interest levels by your business? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: So our perspective on M&A remains unchanged here. First of all, our funnels continue to be very active. As you know, our balance sheet, which is now at 1.5 turns is in great shape. We're starting to see in the marketplace some recognition and I'll even say some acceptance of the lower valuation levels that we have now seen for a good period of time. And I would say it is early days, but the environment for M&A continues to improve. And as you know, in the past, when there have been these kind of situations, Danaher has been able to deploy capital in a really value-creating way. And of course, it's our intention to do that here in the future as well.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks, Rainer, thanks, Matt.
Operator: Our next question -- I'm sorry, our last question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Good morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on -- back to the Diagnostics business. On Cepheid, can you just talk about the non-COVID piece, what you're hearing customers in terms of utilization, usage, particularly those who bought instruments during COVID? Obviously, you saw the installed base double over a couple of years there. Would love just some perspective in terms of what you're seeing as COVID comes down a bit, respiratory comes down here shortly, what the expectations there are?
Rainer Blair: I mean, Patrick, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. As you mentioned, over 50,000 instruments placed, more than double than we've had; well into the mid-20s in the number of tests. Now as you can imagine here in the fourth quarter and sort of the beginning of the first quarter, our customers have been busy with respiratory testing. No question about that. But we're very encouraged by the fact that even in the fourth quarter, we saw that non-COVID testing growing at over 20%. And I think that's indicative of a couple of things. First of all, we were very strategic in how we thought about placing our instrument in the sense that we really stayed at the point of care with customers that would be able to standardize their larger IDNs around the GeneXpert architecture as well as leverage subsequent to the pandemic, the broad testing menu that we offer, and we continue to see that. Not only do we continue to see that, but we see continued consolidation of point-of-care molecular testing onto the GeneXpert platform, which is likely also another driver for us seeing the continued adoption of the non-respiratory menu. So very positive outlook here. We're encouraged and its still kind of early days.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on Dan's capital deployment one there. Can you just refresh us on kind of how you think about leverage ratios and if the current rate environment changes your perspective at all in terms of what size deal you guys would look at?
Matthew McGrew: Yes, Patrick. Yes, I mean from a leverage perspective, we've been, I think, a couple of times in our history, we got to a little bit over four. So -- I mean, I think we've always said we don't have much of an appetite to be rated any lower than we are, for sure. So I think that's sort of the outer boundaries of what kind of think about. But we kind of -- we've been all over the place historically. We don't really have a target of two or three. It just sort of moves around with the deal activity, and we sort of take our time to it. And as far as the current rate environment, I don't think it changes it for us. I think we still think about sort of returns in the same way that we did. We've been doing this a long time. We've been in rate environments like this before. We've been in the rate environments that are worse. Last 10 or 12 years, obviously, had at close to zero was a very different time, but I don't think we have fundamentally any changes here given where we're at.
Patrick Donnelly: Alright. Thanks, Matt, thanks, Rainer. 
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.
Rainer Blair: Well, first of all, thanks again, everybody. We are thrilled with the way we closed out 2022, and we see a strong 2023 ahead with all the numbers, maybe just a quick recap. For 2023, we see our base business growing at high single digits. And in the first quarter, we see that base business despite the fact that we're working off some biotech and bioprocessing inventories at mid-single digits.  Now we've talked at length about COVID testing and vaccine, therapeutic headwinds and I think those are real. But despite those headwinds, we feel great about the important role that we played in the pandemic. Keep in mind, we have reinvested COVID-related cash flows to create lasting annuities with acquisitions and breakthrough innovation while further strengthening our balance sheet. And so, we exit the pandemic much stronger than we entered with higher growth and higher margins in our base business. So with that, we thank you for the call. Wish you all the best for 2023.
John Bedford: Thanks, everybody. We're around for follow-ups all day. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-20 08:00:00) =====

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Thanks, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, our third quarter Form 10-Q, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call and additional materials are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in. Our positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance. This strength was based across the portfolio with high single-digit or better core growth in all three reporting segments. We're particularly pleased with the consistent performance of our base business which has grown high single digits or better for nine consecutive quarters. Now these well-rounded results were driven by our team's outstanding execution through a challenging operating environment. They've done a terrific job running the Danaher playbook to proactively reduce structural costs while continuing to accelerate high-impact growth investments. We believe our ability to deliver meaningful innovation and reliably serve customers, has contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses. Now during the quarter, we also announced our intention to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company. This new company, which we'll refer to as EAS for now, will be well positioned in the most attractive areas of the water quality and product identification market. EAS will be comprised of outstanding businesses with strong ESG fundamentals, durable business models and a very attractive financial profile, averaging mid-single-digit core revenue growth over the last five years with 55% recurring revenue today and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. Now as a stand-alone company, EAS will have greater opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital towards M&A. And of course, EAS will have the Danaher Business System as its foundation, along with the commitment to continuous improvement that will support the same outstanding results EAS as a part of Danaher today. Of course, we look forward to sharing more details here in the coming months. As for Danaher, this separation will establish us as a more focused science and technology leader committed to innovation and making a profound impact on human health. We've got a great lineup of leading franchises positioned in highly attractive life sciences and diagnostics end markets, all united by a common set of durable, high recurring revenue business models. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitive advantage in these areas, and we see tremendous opportunities to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.7 billion, and we delivered 10% core revenue growth, including 8.5% core growth in our base business. Respiratory testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. Geographically, we continue to see strong demand across the developed markets despite current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. North America's core revenue was up high teens with all three segments delivering double-digit or better core revenue growth. Core revenue in Western Europe grew high single digits with customer activity and funding levels remaining healthy. High gross markets core revenues were up mid-single digits. In China, our teams effectively managed through ongoing COVID-19 headwinds to deliver high single-digit growth in the quarter. Our gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.8%, and our operating margin was 26.3%. We had 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driven in part by disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions. The operating environment remains dynamic across our businesses globally, but we experienced fewer supply chain disruptions in the third quarter. Logistics improved as freight costs began to stabilize. We also saw modest improvements in material availability, though certain electronic components remained difficult to procure. Despite these challenges, our teams have done an outstanding job taking proactive measures and leveraging the DBS tool set to minimize the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.50 were up 7% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.2 billion year-to-date. So now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 4% and core revenue was up 8%. Strength was broad-based with most businesses achieving high single-digit or better core revenue growth. In Bioprocessing, robust activity levels drove over 20% growth in our non-COVID business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. As expected, our customers continue to transition away from COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic program and into programs for other modalities. We expect these trends to continue through the fourth quarter resulting in high single-digit core revenue growth in our Bioprocessing business for the full year. In September, we hosted an Investor Day at Cytiva to showcase our Bioprocessing business and highlighted the tremendous long-term growth opportunities we're positioned for in biologics and genomic medicine. We also announced that we're bringing together Cytiva and Pall's Life Sciences as the biotechnology group. The combined portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities for monoclonal antibodies to emerging cell, gene and mRNA-based therapies. The biotechnology group will have unmatched global scale with the industry's largest commercial team, allowing us to further extend the reach of our best-in-class customer service. We also believe focused innovation across the joint portfolio will ensure our products and solutions are aligned to best meet customers' needs around quality, yield and cost. With Pall's Life Sciences and Cytiva joining forces, the Biotechnology Group is uniquely positioned to help our customers become more efficient and bring more life-saving therapies to market faster. Moving to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. They collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by SCIEX, Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Funding levels remains strong globally, and we saw solid customer demand across most major end markets. We continued our strong pace of innovation in life sciences with the introduction of Beckman Coulter's Biomet Ingenious. The Ingenious is a cost-effective easy-to-use sample preparation system that reduces manual transfers and hands-on time and next-gen sequencing library construction. This is a great example of how our investments in innovation are delivering impactful solutions to our customers. Our genomics businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by strong demand for plasmic, RNA and next-generation sequencing solutions. This quarter, marked Aldevron's first anniversary as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance. Financially, the results speak for themselves, with more than 30% year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition. The team has done a tremendous job embracing DBS tools and processes to meaningfully reduce lead times and increase capacity. Now this capacity is certainly supporting customers' needs today, but it's equally important to support Aldevron the long-term growth outlook. With a view towards the future, we're excited about the opportunities to collaborate across our genomics businesses and create unique solutions to help our customers accelerate the development and commercialization of mRNA and other nucleic acid-based therapies. Moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 13.5%, led by nearly 30% core revenue growth at Cepheid. Leica Biosystems grew mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. As customers seek to improve productivity within their labs, we're seeing strong early momentum for Leica innovation, BOND-PRIME, a fully automated advancing platform. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics delivered solid results with mid-single-digit core growth despite ongoing COVID-19 headwinds in China. In Molecular Diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu grew approximately 10%, led by double-digit growth in virology and infectious disease testing. In respiratory testing, global PCR volumes have moderated, but demand is still elevated for symptomatic testing at the point of care where Cepheid is the gold standard. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $875 million exceeded our expectations of approximately $325 million. Higher prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, combined with advanced purchases by customers in anticipation of a more severe respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, led to both higher volumes and a preference for our four-in-one test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. Now we're starting to see our customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms onto Cepheid gene expert. The gene expert provides significant value to clinicians with a unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow. Customers are also increasingly interested in opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading testament. Our opportunity funnel for non-respiratory tests has increased significantly this year and we see opportunities to continue gaining market share moving forward. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 10.5%. Water quality was up mid-teens, and product identification grew low single digits. Electronic identification, marking and coding was up low single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up low single digits, in part due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q3 last year. Now during the quarter, we saw strength in food and beverage as well as the consumer end markets. In Water Quality, ChemTreat and Hach each grew high teens during the third quarter. Demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remain solid across our major end markets, municipal and industrial project activity was broadly consistent with the first half of the year, driving solid equipment growth. Now last week at WesTech, the annual wastewater trade show, the water quality team highlighted several solutions that are improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water treatment process. POC's Ultra Low Range Chlorine Analyzer raises the industry standard to parts per billion chemical detection levels, helping customers extend the membrane life of their treatment systems and reduce maintenance costs. At Trojan, innovative solutions such as Trojan UV Signa and Trojan UV 3000+ reduced environmental impact by treating water with ultraviolet light instead of traditional chemical disinfection method. Every day, over 1 billion people benefit from water treated by Trojan. So these are just a few examples of how our water quality platform is supporting customers day-to-day, mission-critical water operations and making a positive impact on the world. So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a high single to low double-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in a core revenue growth being flat to down low single digits in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%. Now for the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We now expect high single-digit overall core revenue growth, which is up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits as a result of our strong COVID-19 testing performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect operating profit fall through of approximately 25% for the full year. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Our well-rounded performance really is a testament to our team's commitment to innovating and executing in support of our customers. These results also reinforce Danaher's strength and durability. Our differentiated portfolio is well positioned in attractive end markets with long-term secular growth drivers and our business models are resilient with nearly 75% of our revenue today being recurring. So putting it all together, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet, combined with our talented team and the power of the proactive application of the Danaher Business System, provides an outstanding foundation for delivering sustainable long-term results. So with that, I'll turn it back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. Shelby, that concludes formal comments, and we're now ready for questions here.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: So, obviously, there's a lot of questions on the Bioprocessing market given one of your competitors in that market was talking about inventory stocking yesterday and which hit the sector. Can you just sort of elaborate on what you're seeing in a little bit more detail on Bioprocessing inventories? Also, we've gotten the question -- you're talking about high single-digit growth for the full year. I think you commented high single to double-digit prior quarter. So can you sort of walk us through the dynamics? Are you still looking for like $1 billion in COVID vaccine for this year? Just a lot more color what's going on given that's going to be -- given how sensitive topic that is?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Derek. And let me get right after that question here. So First of all, let's talk about 2022, and I'll certainly speak about the inventory topic here as well. I think Important to reiterate that overall, we're seeing very strong customer demand in Bioprocessing, and we expect to finish 2022 with high single-digit core growth. Now that splits up in a number of sections. Let's start with the non-COVID Bioprocessing is growing well over 20%, and we continue to see that. And the underlying fundamentals here are the funding is there, the clinical trials continue to progress. The pipeline is strong. We're seeing product move into commercial production from Phase 3 and this has really accelerated across all modalities. So sure, monoclonal antibodies, but yes, we're even seeing cell and gene therapy starting to gain their approvals. Additionally, pricing is above historical levels, which is driving some incremental growth, if you will, on top of the underlying demand in the non-COVID areas. Now as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers do continue to move away from COVID-related projects. And I don't think that's a surprise to any of us. That's something that we have been speaking about for some time. And in fact, we can confirm that, that is happening. And I think it also reconciles with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We're seeing that vaccines, our uptake is relatively slow. People are unsure if the current vaccine inventories will address the newest variance. So, there's a bit of uncertainty there, I think, in the public as to where we go from a vaccine perspective. And that reflects naturally in what we have seen here with customers starting to move to the other modalities and drive the projects that they had on hold forward. And for us, that manifests here in for the full year that we see $800 million of COVID revenues in Bioprocessing as opposed to the $1 billion that we had been talking about previously. So, we do see customers moving away from these COVID projects and driving their energies, their efforts, and their financial resources into the other projects, and that helps explain why we see the larger part of the business growing at well over 20%. Now, we are not seeing significant stocking, but we do see pockets of stocking, particularly there where there were large COVID-related, either therapeutic or vaccine programs. So, those players that heavily invested in large programs here those players that, in fact, have higher inventories than is normally the case. Having said that, those large players also are those, which are best positioned to redeploy those inventories to other projects. So, we do expect an inventory burn down with those players here in the coming quarters. So that's the inventory situation there, Derik. And then as it relates to some of the other points here, I think we continue to be -- and I just want to reaffirm the high single-digit growth. We're high single digit here year-to-date, and that's how we see ourselves in Bioprocessing concluding the year.
Derik De Bruin: Got it. And the order book, the growth in the order book for Bioprocessing on the non-COVID growth there?
Rainer Blair: Sure. Sure, Derik. So for Q3, our orders are down over 20% as expected. And I think that's a number which bears some commentary and context. First of all, we're coming off of order comps that are well in excess of 50% in the prior year. And so it's important to take in order to be able to rationalize these numbers that sometimes are viewed in isolation with the right context. The three-year order stack is over 20%. And I think something that is perhaps not as well known and that bears some conversation is we and many others have meaningfully reduced our lead time. And we've done that through capacity investments. We've done that through productivity investments. We've been able to do that because the supply chain has become more secure. And that's a pretty significant impact on the order placement cadence of our customers. So just to mention an example here, if lead times go from 52 weeks, which has been the case in some product categories in the marketplace, to 12 weeks, customers fundamentally change their order patterns. To give you a sense of that, if a customer wanted to order over time four bioreactors, they would order all four bioreactors at one, if there's a 52-week lead time. But if it's a 12-week lead time, they would order one bioreactor and then follow up with other orders in the future. So what we're seeing right now is really the normalization of the marketplace coming from a red-hot pandemic fuel time of constraint a long lead times for orders ramped up significantly. So order rates ramped up significantly to the supply chain now normalizing and customers adjusting their order cadence. And then yes, of course, the COVID volumes are down. That's expected. We've been talking about that, but we also see the strength of the non-COVID market. And keep in mind, that's a much larger market. And currently, it is growing at well over 20% and there's a backlog to be burned down there because previously COVID had been prioritized. So, the orders were negative to repeat, but not unexpectedly and to be seen in the context of a market that is now readjusting.
Matt McGrew: And Derik, you had asked about the non-COVID as well. So if you think about the book-to-bill there in the quarter, it was essentially 1.0.
Derik De Bruin: I'm sorry, what?
Matt McGrew: Essentially, 1, 1.0.
Derik De Bruin: Okay. Got it. And do you still -- and just one final question. Do you still expect to take significant price across the portfolio next year?
Rainer Blair: We continue to think about price as a lever for us. And we think that lever is available to us next year as well. We have taken the necessary steps to do that. We're over 400 basis points here in the quarter. That's up from 300 basis points in the first half of the year. We expect the fourth quarter to be similar, and we're going to try and keep that momentum going here in the new year as well.
Matt McGrew: And that commentary is overall, Derik, but I don't think that, that would be any different for Bioprocessing numbers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Go back a little bit to Cepheid. Are there costs -- I would imagine that cost was not a main focus when you were supplying just extreme demand for quite the last couple of years. But are there costs or is there a playbook where cost can come out of the business and to give you a little bit of a tailwind on the margin side while growth kind of stabilizes?
Rainer Blair: So we have, as you suggested, invested significantly in order to drive -- to be able to supply the demand here during the pandemic and watch very carefully where our capacity needs to be, one, to, of course, serve the needs of the pandemic, but also to fuel the growth in our non-COVID testing business. And that continues to grow very well here. You saw the very strong growth we had in COVID, but not to be underestimated, the very nice 10% growth in non-COVID off of a very strong comp in the prior year. So capacity for us is an area of great focus. And we're able to adjust that capacity up and downwards, both in terms of units of capacity, but also cost adds we need. So that is a relatively flexible lever for us, and we'll continue to adjust that lever up or down, both from a capacity perspective as well as a cost perspective as required.
Scott Davis: So that's helpful. And let's -- if we can go a little bit bigger picture. Reiner, when you think about the M&A funnel, how wide is the lens. You guys obviously have a lot of big focus asking.
Rainer Blair: I would characterize our lens as broad and not limited to cell and gene therapy. We want to have a profound impact on human health, Scott. We've talked about that here now for some time, and that allows us a very large space in order to identify investment opportunities, capital deployment opportunities. And as such, our funnel is wide and deep and very active as always.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Congratulations on a good steady print here this morning. Just maybe back on the vaccine question. I appreciate all the color. And I know given that we don't have the order numbers, I know what you implied by the lead times coming down, but just maybe to put a finer point on that. Is your outlook for Bioprocessing including vaccines, I think Danaher expected high singles for '23. Has that changed? And I think prior expectation was $0.5 billion of vaccine revenue for next year. Has that changed?
Rainer Blair: As you can imagine, we're very focused on delivering the fourth quarter here and the full year. But as we think about '23, and I say that because there's a lot of data points to collect here in the fourth quarter as well in such a dynamic environment. And so as we think about the Bioprocessing business for 2023, we still think that there is room for $500 million of COVID opportunity in order to support the needs of the population, the variance to replenish expired sell-by dates and all the things that you can think about. But of course, that's a number that we watch very closely. More importantly, we think that the non-COVID business, which, of course, will again proportionately be a much larger part of the business, will continue to be very robust. Funding levels are there, the number of modalities that continue to grow in the pipeline is broad, our own project activity in early, mid- and late stage is very strong. So, we do not have a different view on 2023 for Bioprocessing today. But of course, it's a fluid situation, and we continue to watch all of that, and we'll update in January when we speak again.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful, Rainer. And just to sort of clarify, any change here, that sensitivity would be on the vaccine side, but not on the base correct?
Derik De Bruin: That's correct. That's the way we see it for sure today. And recall, I mentioned just a minute ago to Derik that in 2022, we were expecting $1 billion of COVID vaccine, therapeutic revenue. We've taken that down to $800 million. It is, of course, offset by the non-COVID business so that we deliver that high single digits here in 2023 for file process. And then looking forward to 2023, we would see that going from $800 million to $500 million.
Vijay Kumar: Appreciate the color, Rainer. Matt, One quick one for you. Based on current FX rates, and I think your assumptions on pricing for next year, how should we think about incremental margins for '23?
Matt McGrew: For '23?
Vijay Kumar: Yes.
Matt McGrew: I'm going to go ahead and ask that we get through Q4 here and see where it is. If I had to guess on the FX margins today, I would have been wrong a quarter ago and wrong the quarter before that. So we'll give you a full update on '23. I mean I think you've seen where the margins have gone to. You know that we're going to have an FX headwind next year on the top line of probably, call it, $800 million. So you can probably start there. I would say that the fall-through on that is probably going to be the pretty typical 35% to 40% fall through. And that could be a little bit better or worse depending on where that revenue actually comes in from a mix perspective. But that's probably the best I can give you now, what we know what the rates are. But from a full margin perspective, I'll have to wait until we get a little bit closer and to our guidance in '23.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen and Company.
Dan Brennan: If I may, just Rainer, I know on the last call, and it was already addressed in some of the Bioprocessing information. But when you look more broadly, obviously, you see a lot of mixed signals on the macro. Last call, you had suggested all-in organic mid-single and if you factor in the COVID would roll off low single digits, like any updated thinking on how you think about that? I know you've already addressed the bioprocess side, but just wondering for the other parts of the business, kind of how those are playing out right now?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan. So, I think we are still in that ZIP code here, specifically, if we think about our base business without testing, so our business without COVID testing. For 2023, we still see that as mid-single-digit plus. And of course, we're watching. There's a lot of headlines in Western Europe and emerging markets, but to date, our business momentum does not indicate any dramatic slowdown here. And so we think mid-single-digit plus from today's point of view, for the base business is the right way to think about it. And as we go forward here and Matt mentioned this, of course, we're looking at all the data points daily here. And then in January, we'll update you again, but from today's perspective, mid-single-digit plus for the base business. And then as it relates to COVID testing, we do still anticipate that step down, the experts that we speak with, our customers still think that COVID is endemic by the end of '23, beginning of '24 and that will step down there from where we've been here, close to 50 million tests to about 30 million tests or the $1.2 billion roughly of COVID revenue. And then lastly, I'll say, the FX situation is very dynamic. We've been talking about that. And I think Matt covered that as well.
Dan Brennan: Great. And then just maybe one more follow-up. I don't want to kind of continue to readdress Bioprocessing, but I'm just wondering, you talked about bringing in lead times dramatically, which suggests that customers aren't going to need to order as far in advance, right, because you've got them down significantly. The peer yesterday talked about inventories at 12 months versus six months and I know you addressed inventories in one of the prior questions. But can you just speak to it just one more comment, and I apologize, is on the base business. I believe you've done a better job from prior conversations about maybe managing and kind of avoiding some double ordering. But just kind of what do you see broadly on the inventory side for your base business? And kind of how does that kind of impact your outlook for the base power production business as we look forward to '23?
Rainer Blair: We have been as a result of the pandemic, even closer than traditionally working with our customers to understand their production plans and to ensure that they are not overstocking at the expense of others who would need the product. And what was a time of constraint here for the last, call it, 18, 20 months. So as a result of that, we feel as though we are well positioned to understand the inventory situation. We do regular surveys with our customers. And as a result of that, we don't believe that there is a general overstocking in the market. Having said that, we do think there are pockets where inventories are high. And those are based on customers ultimately changing their production plans, in other words, canceling orders specifically for COVID. And so the large COVID players whether that be for vaccine production or whether that be for therapeutics production, they have larger inventories and those will likely exceed six months of inventory. But I think it's important to note that those large players have many programs, and they're able to redeploy that inventory. In most cases, these are not tailor-made solutions for any specific molecule and can be redirected and burn down using -- in the use for other modalities or other programs at the same modality. So we do see that the market is currently resetting itself from, as I mentioned, a red-hot pandemic era of constraint with long lead times to one where lead times and supply chain disruptions are starting to normalize and then add to that the cancellation of some COVID vaccine or therapeutic plans just because the uptake hasn't been the same or the variants have rendered them not usable for that application. So, we are confident that the strength of this market and its fundamentals, remain very, very strong. Biologics, in all the modalities that we've talked about are very underpenetrated in the market, and it is a matter of getting the penetration up launching the new products in the pipeline that we'll continue to drive the growth of this market despite the reset that we see going on in the supply chain.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse.
Dan Leonard: So my first question, Rainer, I was hoping you could elaborate on trends in China across your different OpCos? I think you said growth was high single digits in total, but flagged some weakness in diagnostic. So just wondering, if you could offer more color by OpCo?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So as you just said, just to level set, you see high single-digit growth here in China, both for Q3 and we anticipate a similar level in Q4. And that's really a broad-based strength there. Let me start with Diagnostics where we did see patient volumes impacted by these rolling shutdowns. So this zero COVID policy shutdown that you're likely reading about in China. So that affected patient volumes and think of those as being 90% to 95% of what they were in 2021. And we're working through those and continue to see China as really a very, very strong market. Now lastly, the rest of our business continues to be very, very strong. As you think about life science instruments, as you think about EAS, as you think about the diagnostics, the other diagnostics companies, we continue to see robust demand there. And as patient volumes normalize, which we expect to happen sometime in the next year, we're confident that China continues to be a really strong growth lever here for the future.
Matt McGrew: And Dan, just to give you some context, I mean, life sciences and EAS were both up high single digits in the quarter. And Diagnostics, while it did struggle a little on the patient volumes, I mean, it was still up mid-single digits.
Dan Leonard: Appreciate that color. And Matt, just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the impact of higher interest rates on the business? Did that change at all how you're managing the balance sheet or your capital allocation priorities?
Matt McGrew: I don't think so. From a balance sheet perspective, we don't really have -- we've got no variable sort of debt, so that doesn't really impact us. I'm trying to think -- I mean, it might have spots here or there from things like currency swaps that we've done and interest income. But I mean those are pretty minor. I mean, I don't think we think of capital allocation in a different way. I mean, I think we still sort of go through the same processes from an M&A perspective and a return perspective and interest has always been a component of that. So I don't think it really changes all that much on how we're thinking about: A, running the business the balance sheet, given where we're at on fixed sort of mostly fixed debt here, and I don't think it really impacts us on our thinking about doing something different than what we do, which is allocate capital towards M&A largely.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: So I want to talk about the instrument growth. It looks like another big quarter for SCIEX and LMS. This is following a very strong first half of the year. Can you just give us a sense of where all the demand is coming from? Is this like a new facility build-out? Or are these from upgrades? And then how does -- how do think about this from a comp perspective, how you guys are thinking about it for next year?
Rainer Blair: Just a level set, our Life Science instrument business grew low double digits in Q3. And as you pointed out, this is really led by Leica Microsystems, SCIEX, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences with some very, very strong results. And I think the strength of that comes from two areas. The first is the end markets continue to be very strong. So especially pharma, CROs and academic research continues to be well funded, and we're seeing strong buying behavior there, especially towards instruments that provide the necessary answers here in the research. And that's really the newest generation of instruments. And that brings me really to the second pillar of the strength that we've seen there, which is our continued innovation performance there, with all of the operating companies really leaning in and launching leading edge really pushing science further instruments. And I'll give you some examples at SCIEX, ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500. At LMS, you have the THUNDER widefield imaging system, and we talked about the Mika launch, which is doing extraordinarily well. And then we just talked about the Ingenious launch here at Beckman Life Sciences. So, we're really seeing strength from a funding perspective, and we believe that on top of that, we're outperforming because of the innovation strength that we've shown here, launching a number of great solutions. Now from a comp perspective, we really do think that the strength in the market is sustained. We expect that to be the case in the fourth quarter. And in 2023, like I said, we'll talk about that more in January, but we don't have reason to believe here that this will be significantly different.
Luke Sergott: All right. That's helpful. And then when you're thinking about -- when you called out the supply chain, right, and things are starting to get better. Can you talk about where you're seeing the biggest relief in your end markets or businesses and where you're still seeing things constrained and not getting better?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So I think the first place where you're starting to see some of the pressure dissipates is in the logistics area. So, logistic capacities have ramped. We're starting to see greater availability. We're also starting to see freight rates come down, specifically if you think of container freight Those, in particular, have come down quite significantly. And that, of course, is helpful with the global businesses that we have. At the same time, we do see continued pressure on a more limited set of electronic components. So with the Danaher Business System, call it, we've been able to really knock down 80% of the issues there. And I think with that, able to continue to take share because of the availability of our solutions. And with 20%, we're still in countermeasure mode. And I would say that number continues to get smaller every day, but there's still on the electronic component side, some tightness here. And then lastly, I would just say, what is still the same as labor continues to be tight. That is the case, practically everywhere we operate. And so that that's a constraint that we would expect to see get better here over the next 12 to 18 months, but currently still see that as an area to watch out for.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Patrick Dolly with Citi.
Patrick Dolly: Maybe just one. You touched on China, but maybe on Europe, a lot of macro concerns kind of popped up their heads there over the last couple of quarters. Can you just talk about what you're seeing, again, across the different OpCos there? Any change in terms of your expectations or any elevated concerns as we work away even into '23 with some of the kind the kind of power rationing and things that are happening there, maybe just your exposure, any customer conversations, how you're feeling in that region?
Rainer Blair: Starting with Q3 here just to level set. We had high single-digit growth in Western Europe, and we would expect that comparable here going into the quarter. Our funnels continue to be strong. And I would say that we're starting to see deal velocity slow a little bit. So it is clear that people are starting to think about where they're going to invest their cash at least for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing robust demand and robust funding. Having said that, and in view of everything we read in the news as to you, we continue to watch that very closely to see whether that sustains going forward into '23. And of course, we're going to talk to you about that again in January. Now as it relates to our own exposure, specifically as it relates to energy, we continue for many reasons to take a very close look at our energy consumption, so also from a sustainability perspective. But now particularly this becomes an area of focus for Europe. And in fact, we do not have a lot of heavy manufacturing, so energy-intensive manufacturing in Europe. It's mostly light assembly, and we have taken the measures to ensure energy supply continuity through the appropriate backup systems. And then in the event of, if you will, fuel rationing, whether that's gas oil or otherwise, we also have contingency plans there to ensure that we're able to reduce our demand, but still supply mission-critical capabilities, including manufacturing, should that become the case. So yes, it's something that we're closely focused on. Two, we've taken measures in order to ensure that we have supply and can provide supply continuity. And then lastly, we also have the contingency plans should the situation deteriorate.
Matt McGrew: Patrick, this is Matt. We did a kind of bottoms-up analysis plant by plant, company by company, even factoring in higher costs that we might see here over the winter into the next year. I mean this is a very, very manageable number. It's just not a big number.
Patrick Dolly: Okay. That's good to hear. And then maybe just a follow-up on Luke's instrument question. I guess just kind of wondering in terms of the visibility you guys have. I know the backlog has been elevated. Order growth has been really strong, particularly on SCIEX. There's kind of this -- is there a pull forward? Is there not? Maybe just talk a little bit about, again, the visibility you have, what the backlog looks like currently and just how durable some of that instrument strength is it's been elevated for a while now. So just trying to get a handle on the comfort level of the strength there?
Rainer Blair: So as you suggest, the backlog is elevated. That is due to two factors. The strong demand that I referenced earlier, that's really broad-based, pharma, academic, and so forth. But also because there has been, over the last 18 months, some supply constraints around electronic components. So we see demand remaining strong across the board for all these research applications that I referenced. And as a result of that, we also see that in our order rates and backlog position, not just here for Q4 but also going into '23.
Operator: It appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, Shelby. We're around all day for questions and follow-ups. Have a good rest of the day.
Rainer Blair: Thanks everyone.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 08:00:00) =====

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well thank you, John. And good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today.  So let me start with, we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove better than expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. And we were particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which through high single digits and believe we gain market share in many of our businesses. Now these results are a testament to our team's strong commitment to executing in a challenging operating environment. They have done an incredible job, leveraging the Danaher business system to help mitigate supply chain constraints, manage inflationary pressures, and improve our competitive positioning with impactful new innovation. Our second quarter results also highlights the strength and resilience of the businesses that make up Danaher today. Our portfolio is comprised of leading franchises positioned in attractive end markets with strong, secular growth drivers, all united by a common set of durable business models. In fact, nearly 75% of our revenues today are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into highly regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. On top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. We believe this powerful combination of our talented team and the strength of our portfolio, all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term, competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in a little more detail. Sales were $7.8 billion and we delivered 9.5% core revenue growth, including 8% growth in our base business with strong contributions from all four of our operating platforms. COVID-19 testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter. Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low double digits with broad based strengths across North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up mid-single digits, including impressive high single digit growth in China. Our results in China significantly exceeded our expectations, which is particularly notable as lockdowns continued for longer than we anticipated. So now I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our associates in China for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during such a challenging time, to the teams that managed the approvals necessary to reopen our facilities, the supply chain and logistics teams that kept parts moving and the manufacturing associates who spent several weeks away from their families, thank you. Thank you for supporting the reopening effort. And most importantly, thank you for supporting our customers. This is such a great example of one of our core values. The best team wins in action. Now, as we move through the rest of the year, we're keeping an eye out for further outbreaks and regional lockdowns, but we're currently seeing more normalized business operations in China and expect this positive trend to continue for the balance of the year. Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 60.9%. And our operating margin of 28.4% was up 60 basis points, including 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion. Our strong margin performance was a result of disciplined cost management and the proactive measures our teams have taken to address the inflationary pressures we've seen over the last several quarters. We're also using DBS tools to execute price actions, and we achieved approximately 400 basis points of price increases in the quarter, a significant acceleration from our historical price realization. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 12% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.4 billion year-to-date. Now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment reported revenue grew 6% and core revenue was up 7%. Strength was broad based across the segment with high single digit or better base business core revenue growth at each of our largest operating companies. In our bioprocessing business, we continue to see record activity levels from early-stage research to later stage development and production, which drove a combined core revenue growth rate of high single digits at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our backlog and our order levels remain very healthy. And as always, we're working closely with customers to ensure they have the right inventory levels to support their planned activity. We are seeing our customers continue the healthy transition away from COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, and into previously paused and new programs for other modalities. As a result, we now expect COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2022 down from approximately $2 billion in 2021. Now that said, there is no change to our high-single to low-double digit core revenue growth outlook in our bioprocessing business for the year as customers are accelerating their investments across all other major therapeutic modalities. This acceleration, paired with improving price realization, is driving more than 20% core growth in our non-COVID business, up from the low-double digit growth we've seen historically. The biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments and development and production. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody based-therapies in development globally, which is up more than 50% from just five years ago. This is being driven by both novel molecules and development and the proliferation of biosimilars, which are helping to accelerate adoption and underserved markets as patents on higher volume therapies expire. There are also over 2,000 cell and gene therapy candidates in development today, a more than tenfold increase over the last several years. Now, given this backdrop of such a significant and sustained increase in activity, we expect the growth rate in this market to remain very strong for many years to come. Now as the complexity required to manufacture these life saving treatments increases, customers are looking to collaborate with us to help them solve their most challenging problems and assist them as they move from lab to production scale. Cytiva recently announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop the industry's first modular end-to-end manufacturing platform for allogeneic cell therapy, which will help to improve the treatment of a broad array of diseases, including cancer. This collaboration is just another great example of how our scientific expertise and leading positions in upstream and downstream applications are helping these cutting edge therapies advance from the laboratory to the clinic. Our more instrument oriented life science businesses collectively delivered high-single-digit base business core revenue growth. We're seeing a healthy funding environment and solid demand across most major end markets. SCIEX core revenue was up more than 10% in the second quarter driven by an acceleration of new projects at our biopharma, CRO and academic research customers. We continued our cadence of innovation with the introduction of several new solutions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of genomics and proteomics research. Notably SCIEX introduced the Zeno SWATH DIA, an innovative software solution, which doubles the number of proteins that can be discovered versus previous swath approaches. Helping researchers discover more potential biomarkers and better understand the cause and treatment of diseases. Now in our genomic businesses, customers are making significant investments in the development and production of cell and gene therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines, and gene editing. IDT had its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth led by robust activity and NextGen sequencing and gene writing and editing. Aldevron grew more than 20% while also making significant progress on the capacity expansion projects needed to support their long-term growth outlook. Now moving to our diagnostic segment, reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 12.5% led by nearly 30% growth at SCIEX. Our other diagnostic businesses including Beckman Coulter diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth despite headwinds from the COVID-19 related shutdowns in China. In China, our diagnostics core revenue was flat year-over-year. Site access and patient volumes slowly improved as the quarter progressed with a more pronounced recovery in June. Patient volumes remain slightly below normal levels, but we expect continued recovery as we progress through the remainder of the year. Now outside of China, patient volumes across hospital and reference labs held up well during the quarter and remain at or above pre-pandemic levels despite recent outbreaks of emerging COVID variants. Our diagnostics customers continue to face skilled labor shortages and are increasingly seeking to improve automation and productivity within their labs. This quarter Leica Biosystems introduced its next-generation fully automated advanced staining platform bond prime to help address these needs in the pathology lab. Bond prime facilitates a continuous pathology lab workflow and delivers the high resolution stains needed for a definitive diagnosis with an industry leading average turnaround time of only 90 minutes. Now, as I mentioned earlier, core revenue growth at Cepheid was up nearly 30% in the quarter. Low-teens growth across our non-respiratory test menu was led by sexual health, hospital acquired infections and virology. In respiratory testing, strong global demand persisted for Cepheid's point-of-care assays and we believe we continued to gain market share. Respiratory testing revenue of approximately $750 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations of approximately $400 million. The spread of highly transmissible COVID variants and greater incidents of other respiratory infections such as RSV and flu led to both higher testing volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 combination tests. As a result, our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19 Flu-A, Flu-B and RSV represented about 50% of the 16 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID only tests accounting for the remaining 50%. Now as COVID-19 shifts to an endemic disease state, we're seeing more customers begin to consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platform onto the Cepheid GeneXpert. This preference for the GeneXpert both within hospitals and across healthcare networks is evidence of the significant value, the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and an easy-to-use best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. In addition, as our customers begin freeing capacity from respiratory testing, they are increasingly interested in discussing opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading point-of-care molecular testing menu. Now moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 10% with double-digit core growth at water quality and mid-single-digit core revenue growth at product identification. In water quality ChemTreat, Trojan and Hach each group double-digits during the second quarter. Robust growth in our analytical chemistries and consumables was broad-based across all major end markets. Equipment sales remained strong with healthy levels of project activity at both industrial and municipal customers. At product identification, marking and coding was up high-single-digit and packaging and color management grew mid-single-digit. Videojet was up high-single-digit led by North America where food and beverage sales were particularly strong. Our EAS team are leading the charge and writing the newest chapter in the DBS playbook to counter the supply chain and inflationary pressures we're seeing every day. They've been reengineering products to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components and using daily management to work closely with suppliers to ensure production part availability. These efforts along with our accelerated price actions are also helping improve our margin physician. We saw the impact on our results this quarter with more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion at EAS. Our strong performance also highlights the resiliency and the durability of the high margin recurring revenue business models that make up our EAS portfolio. With that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In a third quarter, we expect to deliver high-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a mid-single-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing resulting in low-single-digit core revenue growth overall. For the full year 2022 there is no change to our previous guidance of high-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and mid-single-digit core revenue growth overall. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect operating fall through at the high end of our previously communicated range of 20% to 25% for the full year. So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our results are a testament to the team's consistent execution in a dynamic operating environment, and to the durable balanced position of our portfolio today. Looking ahead, our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System, our differentiated portfolio of businesses serving attractive end markets and our strong balance sheet all positioned Danaher to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance. So with that I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Bedford: Thanks Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Gretchen, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Derik.
Mike Ryskin: Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik.
Rainer Blair: Hi Mike.
Mike Ryskin: Hi. Couple of quick questions; one on the COVID versus non-COVID bioprocess you talked about, really appreciate the clarity on the reduction in COVID but then fully offsetting that with non-COVID strength. I want to ask on the non-COVID bioprocessing, your higher expectations for that. How durable do you think that is in the future years? Is that growth rate in those business sustainable for 2023 and beyond? Or are we seeing a little bit of a catch-up in 2022? Just due to some of those projects being put on hold the last couple of years?
Rainer Blair: Thanks Mike. Look, I mean, I think the way we see it is the only way. What level set on 2022 here where in the COVID business we see revenues going from 2021, $2 billion to 2022, $1 billion? The non-COVID business as you suggested has accelerated here as customers are moving to non-COVID modalities and all sorts of them very broad based and of course on the margin price-ends up helping that as well. So we would expect certainly for 2023 to continue to see elevated levels of non-COVID activity probably above the low-double-digits that we have seen historically too early to say if it stays up over 20%, but certainly elevated in 2023 versus what it's been historically.
Mike Ryskin: Great. Are you seeing any, any stocking or any change in purchasing patterns by any of your customers in particular CDMOs? And that's related to the by bioprocess, but then just overall anywhere across your portfolio?
Rainer Blair: So we have very, very close relationships as a result of what we've just all passed through here in the last 18 months. With all of our customers we conduct regular surveys and while there is the one or the other customer that has canceled the large project, which by the way is not that unusual right in this business project sometimes fail even in late stage clinical trials, I would say generally speaking, we see healthy inventories across the sector and don't see any major pockets of build-up.
Mike Ryskin: Okay. Thanks. And then one last one if I could squeeze it in. The feeling better about the operating margin fall through for the rest of the year, just to clarify, is that the effect of the beat in 2Q? Or is there anything else going into that in terms of pricing, supply chain, COVID contribution sort of like what's changed there?
Rainer Blair: Yes. I mean, I think certainly Q2 is helpful, right? I mean, if you think about sort of where we ended up in the feed that gave us a lot of latitude to offset some of the FX headwinds, but I think if you think about what we're seeing in the businesses pricing is holding in very well kind of couple hundred basis points better than we did here in Q1. You look at the supply chain; I think we've done a really good job of managing that plus driving the pricing. So if you think about where we're at from a price cost perspective we like – we like where we're at. I mean, each of our segments was positive on the margin side here during the quarter. So I do think that as we sort of go forward that we've got – we've got our arms around the price cost and we feel pretty good.
Mike Ryskin: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on a terrific print here. Maybe one in a simplest question on the guidance here Rainer. 2Q revenue to be by 650 basis points, it looks like bioprocessing your orders are strong, instruments are strong, execution coming in about what the annual guidance’s we created; anything going on in second half or is this over to some given the macro?
Rainer Blair: No, I think we feel continue to be really comfortable with our full year guide here. We've talked about the base business being high-single-digit here for some time. And we saw that play out here throughout the quarters. And we don't see any reason whether that is demand and the orders development or the backlog position that would give us pause as it relates to the high-single-digit base business guide that we have. Now as we talk about COVID testing I think you as many and all of us continue to do our best in terms of forecasting, what might be happening and testing at any given moment. But as we go forward with testing I think our perspective that Q3 in particular is sort of the slowest respiratory testing quarter of the year, is important to note. And then of course, as you go into Q4 respiratory season picks up again, and so we would expect to see that as well. And as I talked about there in my prepared remarks, we took up that that COVID testing number to about $2.5 billion here from around $2.2 billion. So we would also say it's important to think about China here. China recovered very well for us here in the second quarter after an unexpectedly long shutdown and we continue even today to see these sort of more limited spot shutdowns throughout the country. So we continue to watch that, but fundamentally expect the second half in China to be more constructive than it was here in the second quarter.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful comment from Rainer. Maybe one for McGrew here. Given increments were north of 40% in 2Q, I think the guide implies back half getting back to 25%. Any incremental inflation or FX impacts here on the back half that's dragging second half incrementals back to 25%. And I think in the past Matt you said LRP incremental should be 35% to 40%. Is that 35% to 40% applicable for a fiscal [indiscernible]?
Matt McGrew: I'm sorry, was that fiscal 2023 you said?
Vijay Kumar: Yes. It was a two-part question. One back half and [indiscernible], yes.
Matt McGrew: Yes. So, I mean, maybe just – let me just be clear. We reiterate kind of what we said for the full year. I can give you a little bit of color on Q3, hopefully that sort of gets you where you need to be. I think, so let me recap what we said in the prepared remarks. Like Rainer just said, we reaffirmed high-single-digit core growth in the base business and overall kind of mid-single-digit core growth inclusive of test. Like we talked about a little bit earlier Q2, our performance gave us the ability to fully offset all over the second half FX headwinds. So you'll see that in sort of the margins. 400 million of incremental FX here since April talking about 1.3 billion, almost 5% for the full year from a revenue perspective, so no doubt for the second half will have. That FX will have an impact worse than it even did in the first half. But despite that additional FX headwind, we expect to be at the high-end of the range that we talked about earlier of 20% to 25% from a fall through perspective. So, I mean, just kind of give you that color of where we think we'll be here in the second half inclusive of FX headwind. And then for Q3, revenue is going to be down $200 million year-over-year, and that is all due to FX headwinds. So if you think about it, we're going to have, call it $400 million of FX headwinds, couple hundred million of core growth and acquisitions, but net-net we're going to be negative here in the year. And from a – I realize from a modeling perspective, it sort of fall through in a negative environment isn't all that meaningful. So I think maybe the easier way to think about where we're thinking about for Q3 is we're expecting our EBITDA margins to be about 30% in the quarter. And so hopefully with that, and then the full year frame, right on 20% to 25% you can kind of – it frames a little bit of what we're thinking about for sort of the back half from a margin perspective. Hopefully that's helpful.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful, Matt. I'm sorry that on 2023 is 35% to 40% still the right number to look at?
Matt McGrew: Yes. I think barring any additional FX headwinds or something who knows what could happen out there these days, but barring anything else, barring FX or some sort of other macro event, yes, I think that's right 35% to 40% on our base business is a good way to think about margins as we head into 2023. We've talked about in the past how our margin profile has rerated from 30% to 35% to 35% to 40%, and there's no change to that.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful perspective. Thanks again gentlemen.
Matt McGrew: Yes.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Vijay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning guys. Now that we're on the topic of FX; Matt, is FX more of a concern on, I mean, is it more of a translation issue for you guys or, or is there a certain level where the competitive dynamic that [indiscernible] product around from dollar based regions to non-dollar based?
Matt McGrew: No, I think it's more the former, I mean it's really what we're seeing now Scott is just – it's not just the Euro, right? I mean, I think that's, that's kind of the key. Yes, that's the one that gets a lot of the headlines with sort of going to parody, but we really are seeing a breadth of FX headwinds globally that is sort of impacting things as we think about Latin America, as we think about Southeast Asia, we think about even China. It's starting to hit us in places where we just we don't have a cost base but we've got some revenues and that's a little bit different than maybe in the past where it was a little bit more Eurocentric for us. It's just really the breadth of the FX headwinds that I think have been sort of quite – it's quite surprising frankly, but that's what we've been seeing here in the first half
Scott Davis: Guys, help us understand the logistics of pricing and some of your business. I know its different business like Beckman. Do you have to wait until kind of contracts kind of renew to get the price? Is it, I mean the big step up in price you had quarter-to-quarter and just a function of time and diagnostics?
Rainer Blair: So I would tell you, it really does vary around the businesses. Absolutely we have contracts out there that have notification periods. Those notification periods and the way we manage contracts with nearly 100% visibility to when we can proactively move those prices is a big part of our pricing standard work. And in all businesses, including diagnostics we have been able to move pricing in the right direction, talked about the 400 basis points here in Q3. And as we think about sort of the second half, the first half between first quarter, second quarter was about 300 basis points let's call it. And that's a good – that's a good placeholder here, I think for the second half as well. Now, as you come to some businesses where contract terms are longer, let's say as a result of freights and other types of inflationary pressures, we are able to talk about other types of fees and up charges that are not directly related to price and that ends up providing us with the requisite uplift as well.
Scott Davis: Well good luck. I'll pass it on. Thank you guys.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Scott.
Matt McGrew: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from Cowen.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Brennan: Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to discuss a little bit about the last downturn and what we're beginning to see happen now. Obviously the company is dramatically different no forward, no dental and you've got all these great structural growth businesses that you've kind of taken on and are growing, particularly across all the biopharma areas. In the last downturn you were down 12% in 2019, but again such a different business. So maybe while we don't know what the magnitude and duration and the moving pieces or what the slow down and the recession, if we enter one we'll entail, clearly you're preparing for a bunch of different scenarios. So I'm hoping you can just maybe help us think about a framework for Danaher, the Street right now has you growing call it like 7% or so on the base for next year? Like, can you give us a sense of how we should consider the different businesses faring as the economy slows here across LS, TX and EMEA and its mid-single-digit, a reasonable downside case to think about or low-single digit. Just anything you can help us frame and again we don't know what the downturn will look like, but you're in a better position than we are to give us a sense of how your businesses will do?
Rainer Blair: Sure. Dan, first of all I think you hit it on the head. We are a very different company today than we were in 2009, and some of that you already saw in 2020 where even as the country and the world shutdown, we only had one negative quarter and ended up being obviously very positive for the year even in 2020. But let's talk about, why here first? I mean, the portfolio transformation that was purpose driven has made Danaher far more resilient today than ever before. And let's talk – let's tease out why that is. I mean, first of all, over 40% of our portfolio – well, over 40% is in biopharma, genomics, molecular diagnostics, and all of these are supported by very, very strong secular growth drivers. And you heard me talk about those in the prepared remarks with a number of therapeutic projects that are in the, in the pipeline that drive so much value creation and activity in our industry. We also see population increases access to medical care increasing. So when we think about patient volumes around the world, we see those continuing to increase. So also from a diagnostic perspective, we're very well positioned. You think about EAS, the positioning there is water is becoming scarcer, unfortunately more polluted and requires more testing. The food supply is under pressure and so PID is very much involved in these kind of macro drivers as well. So we feel that from a portfolio perspective it's nearly purpose built for the world that we're in and the pressures that we live under. Now, you add to that 70% of our revenues or I should say over 75% of our revenues are recurring. And most of those are captive, meaning they're specked in or they're specific to our equipment and instruments along with these super durable business models, razor – razor blade and high service levels. So that's a very different kind of business that once again, I'd say it's purpose built for these type of things. Now you add to that our scale and our DBS led execution where even in tough and choppy times we're able to focus on what matters, which is our customers and execute in that environment. On top of the strength of our balance sheet we actually see these challenging macro environments as opportunities. So rather than battening down hatches here and having our head down, we're focused on executing continuously improving and taking advantage of the opportunities that the crisis can offer us. And so, as you think about our balance sheet position today, less than 2x net debt-to-EBITDA we're well positioned there for sure. And so looking ahead should a recession be there, or should the times get choppier? We're looking to get to the other side of that even stronger than we would enter that. Now, as we think about our 2023 guide, which I think, is what part of your question was trying to tease out, we feel good about our mid-single digit plus positioning there where for, for the long term, which we have talked about in a number of occasions. And when you unpack that a little bit, we see bioprocessing could be up high single digit and that's consistent with what we've spoken of. And as you look at bioprocessing, there we continue to think that the non-COVID business is going to be growing very strong. You saw what we're doing here in the second half of the year with growth rates, well, over 20% in non-COVID, and then we've also, de-risked the discussion here relating COVID related therapeutics and vaccines. We see $1 billion of revenue in 2022, and that's down from $2 billion in 2021. And we'd probably say $500 million for 2023. So 2021, $2 billion, 2022, $1 billion and 2023 $500 million for COVID-related vaccine. And having said all that, we still see our biotechnology business growing at high single digits. And that leads you then with COVID testing. And we've talked about that at length. We speak to our customers about that. They still think that COVID goes endemic at the end of 2023, beginning of 2024. And we still think our framework of about $1.2 billion of COVID testing revenue in 2023, which is roughly around 30 million tests, is the right way to think about it. So when you put all that together we feel very good about the way we're positioned here from a core growth perspective, think mid-single digit plus on the base business. And then, from a COVID headwind perspective, think low-single, mid-single headwind overall giving you a solid low single digit 2023.
Dan Brennan: Great, thanks Rainer. Maybe just one quick follow-up and just as it pertains to China, could you just flush out a little bit obviously the quarter progressed better than expect, and you gave some color about the [indiscernible] continuing. But kind of how do we think about implicit in your full year guide, like, what is China expected to do? And are you expecting or baking in a completely normal China, absent diagnostic for the back half?
Rainer Blair: For a normal year, we would see China in the low double digits, low teen kind of growth. We'd say for the full year, this year in view of what we've seen in the first half, high single digits is the way to think about China, which we consider to be strong growth in view of some of the macro challenges that China is facing today.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Good morning. First question I had is on bioprocessing. So just to follow-up the $1 billion updated COVID guide for the year, can you just provide how much was in the first half? And then the assumption for the second half, could you just talk about what you're assuming related to boosters or government contracts, just how you build up to the $1 billion?
Rainer Blair: So just to repeat here, Jack, for everybody 2021, $2 billion of revenue, 2022, $1 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue, I think, it's fair to say that that trails off here towards the second half of the year, getting you to for that 2023 run rate that I talked about we're $500 million for the year. So some of this stuff is lumpy. So it can go back and forth in a quarter, but that's the general downdraft.
Matt McGrew: Maybe just to put some numbers to it, I'd say it's called a little over 500 in the first half, and then little around 400 or so a little under, in the second half, you can see that sort of the magnitude as the drop get to the $1 billion.
Jack Meehan: Got it. Yes, that makes sense.
Rainer Blair: In terms of boosters and annual shots, look as you know the public health official discussion there continues. Our belief is that it is likely that there is going to be a regular vaccination schedule. It remains to be seen what the uptake of that vaccination will be. But if it is on the order of what flu vaccination is in the country, the kind of numbers that we talked about for 2023 perhaps a little bit less much longer term is probably the order of magnitude in an endemic vaccination regime.
Jack Meehan: That makes sense. And I also had a follow-up on China. So you grew high single digits, the guide was for down mid to high single digits. And that was despite the fact the lockdowns were longer than expected. I guess my question is simple. How do you pull it off? Can you just talk about instruments versus consumables, just what kind of the shape of the quarter will look like?
Rainer Blair: Well, first and foremost, this is about a team stepping up to the plate and executing. Our associates were ahead of the game, proactively working with the various levels of government, municipal, province and then sometimes even national to ensure that we got the necessary approvals very, very quickly in order to be able to open up our facilities again. At the same time our supply chain associates were prepared ahead of the game understanding what it would take to make a quarter, the raw materials that needed to be available, the shift size that needed to be available and the number of shipment hours that they had in order to work through it. And then we have to say our manufacturing associates literally lived in the plants, literally lived in the plants. We built showers, they had cots, we had food and clothing brought in as well as the necessary services to what needed to come back out in order to facilitate what is nothing but extraordinary execution with the highest level of commitment. And as you think about that whether it's instruments or whether it is consumables, it was across the board, those things that were manufactured locally, I just talked about those people in the plants, but also those things that were imported and had the risk of being stuck in the ports as you know, you sort of unwound the congestion associated with the shutdown. Our people were at the front of the line, making sure that our goods got in first and got to the customers were installed, were signed off and are in use today.
Jack Meehan: Very nice. Thank you, Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thanks Jack.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Rachel. Good morning.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Thanks. Good morning guys. Yes, congrats on the nice quarter. So first off on COVID testing, so those obviously came in higher than expected, but I'd like to really dig into the mix of fluid versus standalone. So you were anticipating 10% of the four-in-one test this quarter and 90% stand-alone, but that sounds like it came in about fifty-fifty. So that mix has increasingly been skewed towards the four-in-one product in recent quarters. So how are you thinking about that mix shift moving forward in the back half of the year? And then what's the mix that's anticipated in 30 million tests for next year?
Matt McGrew: Yes, so as we think about – this quarter was you're right it was closer to fifty-fifty. As we sort of think about Q3 what we are sort of hearing, we think that it's going to look a little bit more like the mix we saw Q3 of last year, which was 80% COVID only, 20% four-in-one. So on that, on our 325 million call it 8 million tests or so that we think we do think it'll be kind of skewed a little bit more like it was last year. So like Rainer said too, just to give you some context, I mean, Q3 has historically been the slowest respiratory quarter of the year. And as we sort of talk to our customers, I think, that their expectation as well as we get into the summer here it does typically become sort of the slowest time and then picks back up in the winter. As we get into Q4, I would say that that mix assumption will be more like the fifty-fifty that we saw here and that we saw last winter as well. So I think if you think about Q4, we're talking about $525 million of revenue, maybe 11 million tests or something along those lines in a split of fifty-fifty.
Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you. And then on biotech funding concerns, so obviously there has been a number of concerns about the potential slowdown in biotech funding leading to a smaller funnel at earlier stage biotech companies, as they try to rationalize candidates to conserve cash. And so you flagged a number of stats on the positive pipeline for monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapy, et cetera, the prepared remarks. So can you just walk us through, have you seen any impact or shift in demand from that mid-biotech customer segment as a result of these funding concerns? And then how should we think about – let's say that we face a prolonged constrained funding environment for these mid-biotechs. At what point do you think that could really start to impact that Phase 2, Phase 3 part of the pipeline where it starts to become meaningful from a volume perspective, which is obviously the main driver of that bioprocesing business. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Rachel. Rachel, as you just suggested the majority of these biotech’s are either preclinical or in the very early stages of clinical. And it's really important to note that our business is driven by what's happening in Phase 3 and ultimately commercialized drugs. Over 75% of our business is in that later stage. And so then as you go upstream from that that has less of an impact. And now getting specifically to your point, we really haven't seen much of an impact of the biotech funding crunch here affecting the customer activity levels that we have. And frankly, we do look at these biotech’s and the proposals that they are pursuing whether there is proof-of-concept and data. And our sense is that the good projects, and where the data is solid and convincing, and proof-of-concept is given, they are continuing to attract funding. So we think that today's cash positions in the biotech’s, the quality of the projects that they are presuming as well as the funding environment still providing funding to those that are able to provide data continues to be quite positive and is not impacting our business. Now, of course, to your longer term question, we just have to see that the biotech area is a cauldron of innovation. That's where the risks are taken. That's where the out of the box thinking oftentimes occurs. And that's where the Genentechs and the Amgens and others started and many more that are huge public companies today. So, we of course longer term will want to see that the funding continues to support that kind of innovation environment. But today are not concerned about what we see here for the next call it 18, 24 months.
Operator: Our next question – our last question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi.
Rainer Blair: Hi Patrick. Good morning. 
Patrick Donnelly: Hey Rainer, how are you? Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one just cleaning up on 2023. I really appreciate all the color you gave. It sounds like with all the moving pieces, in terms of COVID headwinds, we'll probably shake out maybe in a little more low-single than the mid-single for 2023. And I'm just trying to figure out, I guess, with all the mix changes again, being a little less, COVID more heavy on the core, what the right way to think about the incrementals is? I mean, it sounds like Matt earlier was talking about kind of getting back to that 35%, 40%. But just wanted to circle up in terms of the moving pieces. Again, given the mix shift, I assume FX will still be a bit of a headwind in the first half. I mean, it's still a bit away, but we'll see what the dollar does. But can you just talk through, I guess, that margin structure as we work our way into 2023, given again, the growth is looking a little more, low single with the COVID headwinds that you laid out?
Matt McGrew: Yes, sure. I mean, I think, maybe just kind of, like you said, get everybody grounded that, that low single is overall the base business we think would be mid-single digit plus and the COVID headwinds which are all testing at this point would be sort of down low- to mid-single to get to a low single overall. And so, as I think about my 2023 margin profile, like I said before, it's difficult right now, given how dynamic things are, especially with the FX, and inflation and supply chains. But I think where we are from an execution perspective here in the quarter where we think we'll be, if we don't have any we might have some FX headwinds, but let's see where that ends up. But if we don't have any extra new headwinds that show up, I just think the normal VCM of 35% to 40% is the place to be. I mean, the COVID testing like you've seen, I mean, it's more or less at the fleet average, we've talked about how we sort of intentionally did that. We price it exactly the same as we price flu. So it's not as if it has a huge outsized necessarily impact. So I still think the right place to be from a margin perspective is that fall through of 35%, 40% on those single digits. But I think given that we're going to grow that base business mid-single digit plus, with that sort of fall through, I still think you would see even in that low-single digit environment, I still think we drive EPS growth.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful, Matt. I appreciate that. And then Rainer you touched a little bit on the M&A landscape, obviously I don't think there is any doubt you guys have the capacity and the balance sheet is healthy. I think the questions are more around are the sellers ready? Or are valuation still kind of resetting in boardrooms? What are the conversations like for you guys? Again, it seems like your appetite is certainly high to your point, macro uncertainty tends to favor you guys, you tend to see a little bit of panic out there sometimes and sellers kind of hit the bid. So can you just talk about conversations? Are people starting to warm up a little bit, or is it still a lot of kind of pointing back six months and maybe we bounce back, maybe we don't, what are the conversations like on that front?
Rainer Blair: Well, the 52-week high has not moved out of the window entirely. But I do think it's fair to say that people are understanding that we're entering into a new environment here that there's a change of the cycle here. We see COVID tailwinds dissipating, many were riding that wave. Higher interest rates are real for everyone. And then of course, these foreign exchange rate issues that Matt was talking about and inflation are real too. So I think that changed macro and the reality of valuations is starting to seep in to the boardroom discussions. But it's still early days. And we continue to watch that we're of course engaged, our funnels are very healthy and as always we are looking for those opportunities that align with our strategy and end market focus, as well as then, of course, premier assets in that particular area, along with the right valuation. So if you noted our balance sheet we're primed here and look at the market with opportunity.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you guys.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for today. And I will turn the program back over to our speakers.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Gretchen. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We will be around all day for follow-ups. Bye.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. My name is Leo and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.
John Bedford: Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thank you, John and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We are off to a good start in 2022 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectations. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our three segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bio-processing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gains. Now, clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team’s commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers and it’s this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for the future. So with that, let’s turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter and we delivered 12% of core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% and with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%. Geographically, revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single-digits. China declined low single-digits, but was up high single-digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19 driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we are seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. So, now let’s take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we are seeing in our end markets today. Let’s start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we are seeing very robust activity levels. Customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single-digits and was up low double-digits, excluding the impact of that significant one-time project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy and we continued to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter. Now over the last 2 years, our customers prioritized the development of COVID-19 vaccine and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers’ core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities, notably monoclonal antibody-based therapies or MAB cell and gene therapies and mRNA-based technologies. In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they are becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel MABT in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment. Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets. Now, we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologic and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plan dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now, this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing are critical to support our customers’ demand today. Long-term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest growing product categories within bioprocessing. So turning to our Life Sciences Instrument businesses, we are seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical CRO and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects. In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems, IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory. At Leica Microsystems, Mica is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mica integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we are investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position. Aldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and is putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen event which focused on increasing throughput further reducing lead times are already generating terrific results. So we are excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing. So now let’s move to Diagnostics, where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5% led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid single-digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strength in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology. The clinical diagnostic market volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screenings and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures allowing them to continue providing critical healthcare services. Now in China, we are currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and we expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter. In Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong and we believe we are taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care. So, as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we are seeing increased demand for Cepheid’s broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double-digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid’s point-of-care molecular testing solutions. Now, respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid’s 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%. So now, let’s move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including [Technical Difficulty] water quality and mid single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end market. The equipment order rate also remained strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects. Now Product Identification, our marking and coding business was up high single-digits partially offset by slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single-digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets. So stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning both from a cost and growth perspective. While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We are also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult to source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now, we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors. Now, our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market, innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and HACH’s HQ series portable meters, are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we are seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid single-digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS. So we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools, paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage. So now, let’s briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19 related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth. So to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today’s dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. So with that, I’ll turn the call back over to you, John.
John Bedford: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Leo, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Derik. Good morning.
Derik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I got just a couple of sort of like incoming from clients. I think, first of all, just a little bit more on the difference between – I think you mentioned 19 million on the Cepheid guide, and it came in at 17. Just a little bit more color on the volume difference there? And I think also a related question, just are you seeing any sort of stockpiling in terms of either vendors for either bioprocessing or on the diagnostics side? And I’ve got more follow-up.
Rainer Blair:
4-in-1 test:
Derik De Bruin: Great. And just can you on the China headwind in the quarter, that 20 to 30 basis points, what’s supply versus demand?
Rainer Blair: Well, this is entirely related to supply accessibility of customers. So the demand in China continues to be very robust. As you may have noted, without the – in the first quarter without this large project in the prior year, China was up high single digits for us, orders very strong. So this is really related to customer accessibility in hospitals, in labs and of course, the one or the other manufacturing plant that’s affected by these shutdowns. Now as we sit here today, we’re already receiving the news from our team that we’re able to open up not just our plant, and so those are starting to open up here as well slowly but surely, as well as we would expect throughout the quarter client – I’m sorry, as well as lab accessibility to improve already in May and then get back to more normal levels here by the end of the quarter.
Derik De Bruin: Great. And if I can sneak one more in, the 2Q hit, nice to see you reiterating the full year guide with that. Is that expected as you expect all that China business to come back? Or do you think you’ll see stronger growth in other regions offsetting it? Thank you. I am done.
Rainer Blair: This is mostly about China getting back to normal activity levels and both customers as well as our plants having the makeup capacity to make up for what we think are relatively short shutdown period. Having said that, the business is a large one, and there is always pockets that will grow faster. So between the two things, we feel confident that our guide for the full year holds.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on a solid Q1 print. Maybe one on the vaccine side. Rainer, I know it’s part of the base. But I guess yesterday, J&J did pull out their vaccine guidance. They are not guiding to vaccine. Not news anymore. Obviously, there is been a lot of questions on the vaccine side and base bioprocessing. So maybe just talk about the bioprocessing trends in the queue. What were order trends were orders above revenues? And are you still confident about the 2 billion of vaccine outlook for fiscal ‘22?
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks, Vijay. So let’s just level set on the numbers briefly here. If we think about bioprocessing Q1, and as I mentioned during my opening commentary, we extract that very large Q1 shipment last year in China, our bioprocessing business was up low double digits here in Q1. Very, very strong order activity, and I’ll come back to that in a minute. Now if you look at our first quarter last year, our sales were up over 70%. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we’re in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. In fact, we still think that we’re taking share there. So that’s sort of one marker that I want you to have. And then the second point is the order activity continues to be very, very strong. Last year, our orders in the first quarter were up over 90%. And so we anticipated that our orders in Q1 of this year would be down but nonetheless, we continue to build backlog here in Q1 as well in the bioprocessing area. And this is why we’re so confident in our core growth guide here for the year and bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we’re seeing and the backlog that we have, that’s really important. So now let’s unpack that a little bit and think about what’s going on and why COVID is sort of one variable, but that there are other variables here that are incredibly important and explain why we talk about the bioprocessing business and its growth in aggregate. So first of all, as you think about the activity levels outside of COVID in the bioprocessing business, it’s important to see what’s going on in clinical trials. And I’ve talked about this, but you know that the project pipeline for monoclonal antibodies is 50% larger today than it was 5 years ago. For cell and gene therapy, it’s 10x larger, driving extraordinary activity here in the clinical trial area. And what you see, and as I mentioned in the opening comments, you see customers really starting to focus on these new projects across all modalities and not just allocating the resources to COVID, but to these new modalities. So that’s really important to note that customer activity level continues to be very, very high, and that plays through in the clinical trials. Now another point to take here is monoclonal antibodies are becoming the standard of care and the predominant class of biologic drugs. So what’s going on in monoclonal antibodies is the primary growth driver in the market and also for our business and recently launched products that are ramping to new treatment and new indications are driving an exceptional amount of volume here. And then you add to that, that emerging markets and high-growth markets, such as China and India, are starting to have access to these monoclonal antibody treatments that provides additional and significant volume leverage. At the same time, you have biosimilar growth, Vijay. So these biosimilars are leveraging the fact that some of the biologic drugs, monoclonal antibody that are higher volume are starting to come off patent, and that’s increasing the penetration of those drugs throughout the world where the penetration has been lower. And that’s providing another growth impetus. And then lastly, I’ll start with this now. We’ve been talking about single-use technology and their adoption for a while, which is an additional leverage growth vector within the bioprocessing business. So all that helped the activity that we talked about provides for volume, but SUT on top of that is substituting more traditional technologies and is growing even faster. And we have well over $1 billion of single-use technology. And we’ve just announced that our third new plant coming on for single-use technologies in Cardiff, Wales. So we feel very confident on the basis of what’s going on outside of COVID. And that’s why we look at it together because it’s the aggregate that we look at and that really ultimately count that, that will drive that high single-digit, low double-digit growth here for 2022 and also supports our high single-digit perspective beyond that.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Rainer. And maybe one quick one for Matt McGrew, I think incremental margins we were looking at perhaps mid-30s. Q1 came in below. Matt, was this was this supply chain inflation impact in Q1 or perhaps FX or maybe just talk about incrementals and have expectations assuming for fiscal ‘22.
Matt McGrew: Yes. No, for Q1, I mean, we kind of came through about 25%. I think that was pretty much in line with what we thought, Vijay. So no real difference, I think – from a year-over-year perspective, the difference between that $35 million to $40 million that we normally talk to in this 25, it was all FX, right? So in the quarter, I mean you think about it, it was kind of like a $0.07 headwind here for us. So I don’t think we saw anything. Obviously, supply chain is what it is, but I think we were able to kind of work our way through that. I really think it was all FX here – excuse me. In the quarter and first quarter. As far as – I think you bring up a good point then as far as the full year goes, so I would say there is no change to the full year fall through other than the FX impact that we’re seeing. And just to kind of lay that out. We continue to expect mid-single-digit core growth from kind of the core and acquisitions, and that will have that 35% to 40% fall through. In January, we thought that FX was going to bring that 35% to 40% down to, say, 30% to 35%. But given the currency moves we’ve seen since January, as we sit here today, I think it’s going to be more like 20%, 25% fall-through for the year versus the 30 to 35 that we sort of guided to the last time. So look, it still leaves us, if we deliver that, that still leaves low single-digit EPS growth for the year despite what I think is some pretty significant FX headwinds year-over-year. And maybe just to give you a color on the sizing of that headwind, I mean right now, FX is going to be a $0.35 EPS headwind year-over-year, and that’s a pretty meaningful number for us here during the year. It’s probably half of what we initially thought. So it’s a pretty big headwind here for the year, and it was a little bit here in the quarter, too.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Matt. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Rainer Blair: Scott, good morning.
Scott Davis: Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail here. The price dynamic, I mean, I know it’s FX is FX. I can’t do much about that perhaps. But – do you – are you still out there capturing additional price to offset the general inflation and general cost and logistics issues that are so prevalent?
Rainer Blair: Scott, we have been working price directly and indirectly, and we’re seeing very good traction. Let me lay that out for you here. And let me start off with the fact that there are inflationary pressures out there. We’ve talked about that in the past. And that moves from sort of the classic topics of memory chips and other types of chipsets and freight and perhaps labor to seeing more broadly inflation. But nonetheless, with the Danaher Business System, our teams have been able to do a number of things here in order to contain this. One, of course, is related to ensuring the robustness of the supply. Many of our businesses today are gaining share because we are able to continue our supply, have shorter lead times because we’re able to access and secure the components necessary to drive our manufacturing in our business. So it’s an important aspect to this entire equation of growth and share gain. Secondly, the DBS toolset that we have been putting in place are also helping us offset costs in the sense, and as I mentioned in the introductory comments that, look, we are able to now reengineer more quickly to other types of – again, I’ll use the example of chipsets to next-gen chip set more broadly consolidate those and not only gain supply, but then also reduce our costs. So there is an entire DBS machine, if you will, that is driving to secure supply and to offset costs. At the same time, of course, we are driving price, and we see strong traction there. In fact, we are well over 200 basis points of price here in the first quarter, and that’s a quarter that still had a fair amount of, if you will, 2021 backlog in it, right. So, we have now worked through the majority of that backlog and expect to see continued momentum there. So, thinking about price at these levels of 200-plus basis points, that’s the right way to think about that. And it’s just another testament to the strength of our portfolio, the degree of differentiation of our product and the leverage that this razor/blade business model provides us with 75% consumables, many of which are specked in or keyed into the equipment or instruments that they supply.
Operator: We will move next to Dan Brennan of Cowen.
Rainer Blair: Hi Dan. Good morning.
Dan Brennan: Good morning Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. So, if I could just go back to bioprocess, obviously, a really nice quarter with a high-single digit growth against so extremely tough comp. I appreciate COVID is part of the base, and it’s great about all the robust demand, obviously, ex-COVID, which is a big driver long-term. But given the interest in kind of dissecting COVID at this point from investors, it would be helpful to learn if the 2022 high single, low-double digit guide continues to incorporate $2 billion from COVID. And if it does, any color you can provide there about like how much of that $2 billion is blocked in with firm orders?
Rainer Blair: Thanks Dan. Really, the way we are thinking about that business is, again, in aggregate, and we do believe that both the underlying strength of the markets as I just laid out, as well as the strength of our backlog, which continues to grow, support both the high-single digit, low-double digit bioprocessing guide for the year. And as you think about COVID within that, COVID is going to do what it does, but there is a larger market that is growing rapidly and we are going to continue to see fluctuation as it relates to COVID volumes, whether there is a decision on booster for different age groups, whether it becomes part of an annualized immunization regimen. All of these are open questions. And our belief is that COVID is a part of our business, but there is another part of this business, which is larger, it is growing at a faster rate and we are making investments to ensure that we capture the appropriate shares here. So Dan, high-single digits, low-double digits bioprocessing growth for 2022.
Dan Brennan: Thanks Rainer. So, I will get on a really strong quarter out of the gate. Maybe can you give us a little color on how the integration is going – and in light of the really strong first quarter, how do we think about Aldevron for the full year in 2022 and beyond?
Rainer Blair: I mean we couldn’t be more pleased with the team. I have been up there several times working with the team, seeing how they are growing, bringing on capacity. We continue to invest in expansions there. And that 40% growth exceeded our expectations and gives you a sense of how quickly the Danaher Business System has gained traction. And that’s a combination of a couple of things. The first thing is the leadership and the team at Aldevron that is pulling and open to applying the Danaher Business System as fast as possible to fortify their competitive advantage in lead times, in quality and to ensure that we drive this business to the growth of its potential. And we think for 2022, we continue to think that the $500 million revenue number is a good number, 40% in Q1. We certainly expect to be in the first half year, well over our expectation of 20% plus that we previously talked about. So, $500 million for the year is a good number, and that team is firing on all cylinders.
Dan Brennan: And if I could squeeze one more in. Just on China. Obviously, good news that you guys are managing through this and the full year guide is maintained. Maybe if you could just give us an update like in Q2, like what you are actually expecting for China? Maybe you said the number, I missed it. And kind of how do you think about China for the full year since you are expecting a nice rebound beginning Q2? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Sure. So, just to revisit, we have talked about China here. In the first quarter, it was really the end of March when we started to see the impact of some of these larger scale shutdowns, and we continue to see those here in the first week of April, although we have just spoken to the team here yesterday and they received approval to start opening up plants and we also see more activity at our customers. And so we do expect to work through the shutdowns here in the second quarter. Again, that was the 200 basis points to 300 basis point headwind that we included in our Q2 guide of mid-single digits. So, as we think about the quarter here and for China, remember, we had a very strong activity level in Q1, high-single digit growth minus that large transaction last year. And we expect that in China will probably be down in Q2, mid to high-single digit percentages for the quarter. Now once again, we expect that to unwind in Q2 and then continue to catch back up here through the year where we continue to see China as a high-single digit market.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Jack. How are you?
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good. Good morning. So on Life Sciences, I wanted to turn to some of the capital heavy businesses, SCIEX, Leica Micro, Pall Industrial. Can you just talk about the durability of the growth you are seeing there? How are order trends – and any change to the growth expectations for the year?
Rainer Blair: So, in Life Sciences, if we now pivot from bioprocessing and more to the life science analytical businesses, as you suggest, Jack, we are seeing very strong underlying activity in the various sectors of the business. If you think about the Pharmaceutical segment, CROs, academic research customers, our funnels are strong and continue to outpace quarter-over-quarter what we have seen in 2021. I think that buttressed for us, particularly because of the strong innovation track record and the recent launches that we have had. I have talked to those at SCIEX, the ZenoTOF, the accurate mAb instrument as well as the 7500 Triple Quad, those are class-leading innovations that are growing exceptionally well and driving market share gains. Beckman Life Sciences, with their CytoFLEX Benchtop sales order the most recent launch. And then of course, we talked about Mica, which is that combination of wide field and confocal leveraging machine learning. So, we are firing on all cylinders here in a strong investment environment. And we think that, that’s sustainable here for the foreseeable future as we continue to see investments from both the biotech sector, but also academic sectors, as well as institutions that are very, very bullish on the innovation and the science that they want to drive forward.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then just a broader question on M&A. It’s been obviously a very choppy macro environment. You look at the cash flow statement, it was a light quarter for you on M&A. Just curious how you are seeing assets in the market, do you feel like expectations have changed at all from sellers and just your own willingness to do M&A kind of in a choppy environment? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Well, Jack, I will tell you, we have excelled in these kind of environments historically from an M&A perspective. These environments of dislocation inevitably show opportunity and we feel very good about how we are positioned with our funnel. Now having said that, the volatility that we are seeing today is while it might not feel that way relatively recent and it’s probably a little too early to see the full impact of that volatility. Having said that, we are sitting here with 2x a turn, very strong free cash flow of over $7 billion and over $10 billion of EBITDA. So, we feel like we are in a very good position both in terms of the strength of our balance sheet as well as the opportunities that lie ahead.
Operator: We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Good morning Rainer. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe you want to kind of jump from away from China on the geographic side. Over in Europe, obviously, a lot going on there on the geopolitical side. Can you just talk about if you have seen any change in customer behavior? Any change in funding over there, what your guys’ perspective is on that region as we work through this?
Rainer Blair: So, Western Europe has continued to perform very well for us. As I mentioned in our opening comments here, we had strong growth in the mid-teens in Western Europe here in the first quarter. And while we think that moderates a little bit here in Q2 just because of some of the prior year performance is, the activity levels remain very strong. Certainly, in Western Europe, that is the case. And as you think about your reference to the geopolitical side, Eastern Europe just has not been that large of a factor in the life science research and bioprocessing area as an example. And from a diagnostics perspective, we continue to see a very high, let’s say, close to normal activity levels as well. So, Western Europe for us continues to perform as expected.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. That’s helpful. And then maybe on the diagnostics business, just looking at the core performance there ex-COVID, looks pretty strong. Can you just talk about that? And then maybe Matt can talk about the diagnostics margins also really strong, just the sustainability there.
Rainer Blair: As we think about the business momentum really in all regions, with the exception of China, which I talked about, we are seeing patient levels, activity levels really at or very close to pre-pandemic levels. And so from a macro perspective and patient volume, it’s a positive environment for us. And then if you put on the back of that, the recent product launches that we have had, the DxH900 hematology as well as the DxA Fit and automation for small and medium-sized labs, we are also continuing to benefit from that NPI pace that we have invested in here over the past year. So for us, diagnostics continues to be a strong forward momentum. Matt, do you want to take this?
Matt McGrew: Yes. I mean on the margin front, I mean I think you think about that that is going to be a big part of that will be Cepheid and the volume that we are seeing there. So, as long as we have got that volume and we expect to have a touch less here into next quarter. But I think those margins are pretty sustainable at that level. We have talked about and importantly, I think the margin profile of the Cepheid respiratory is no different than the margin profile of other Cepheid tests, right. It’s actually very similar to the flu. So, I think it’s a sustainable number here as we look forward.
Patrick Donnelly: Thanks guys.
Operator: We will take our final question from Luke Sergott of Barclays.
Rainer Blair: Good morning Luke.
Luke Sergott: Good morning. Thanks again for the question here. So, I guess I just wanted to kind of dig in on the long-term growth target, the biopharma high-single digits and really trying to figure out where the offsets are coming from? You talked about the mAbs. I know you are adding new capacity, but as COVID kind of is completely up in the air, and that rolls off, give us a sense of how much that could roll off and you guys continue to maintain that long-term growth target?
Rainer Blair: Happy to. So Luke, the way we are thinking about that is – the strength of our underlying business, which I laid out here in some details, some clinical trials, mAbs, biosimilar volumes, keep in mind, it’s the commercialized drugs that really drive volume here in this business. And then of course that additional growth accelerator of the single-use technology adoption. Those are really the foundations that are driving the growth of this business. And the COVID business, it will do what it does, but that variation is within the realm of what we have been casting as the overall growth rate of the business. And so you take the backlog, which continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and you take the growth drivers that I have laid out. That is what supports the high-single digit, low-double digit growth for 2022 and the high-single digit longer term growth guide that we have talked about.
Luke Sergott: Great. Thanks. It’s helpful. And on – so back to Aldevron here, I know they are continuing to add capacity. Is that still – is that coming in faster than you guys expected, or should we still expect that to pace out through ‘23 and ‘24?
Rainer Blair: That’s going to continue to pace out as we add line after line after line. But I would say that these are programs that are coming on, on or better than schedule as the team continues to gain speed here not only with their subject matter expertise, which is differentiated. So, unique in the marketplace, but also with their adoption of the Danaher Business System. So, we look for that $500 million here in 2022.
Luke Sergott: Okay. Great. That’s it all for me. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would be happy to return the call to our host for any concluding remarks.
John Bedford: Thanks, everyone. We will be around the rest of the week for questions.
Operator: This does conclude today’s call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone, have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.
Matthew Gugino: Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call.

Rainer Blair: Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiatives has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses. Now these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us, throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution. The circumstances over the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead indeed. So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all four of our platforms. The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers. Now throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, which as the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory. Now total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. For near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand, and it helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets. And now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter results. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all three segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. And geographically, both have developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20% led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% from the full year and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate. Our core revenue growth in our processing businesses continued to outpace segment level results with Cytiva and Pall Biotech, both up more than 25%. Non-COVID related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29% led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near pre-pandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand that crosses non-respiratory menu, led by telehealth, hospital-acquired infections and urology testing. Cepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately 16 million cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our four-in-one combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments, while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder. Now let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4%, with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. Now across our water quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. Country delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement, with truly a differentiating combination, which has driven consistent market outperformance. In Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets. So a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and high growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread decline in our customer activity. Now given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools such as daily management and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last three quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization. Now in Life Sciences. We're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at pre-pandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest performing end market within the Life Sciences business, while shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise. Now in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics as an important area for future investments. In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near pre-pandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screening and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. In Molecular Diagnostics, global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our four-in-one combination test, and we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter. Now in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million sets for all of 2020. In 2021, Cepheid placed a record 10,000 new GeneXpert system bringing the total install base to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert where the same test cartridges are used on higher and lower throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the market provides our customers with the confidence that they will achieve consistent reference lab quality results, whether they're testing in an urgent care clinic or a central hospital lab. So now looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be in an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and install base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to gain share in an endemic environment. So moving on to the applied markets, customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see a robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects and installations that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic. So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and pre-pandemic rate between 30% and 35%. So now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long-term shareholder value for years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you.
Matthew Gugino: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Rainer, you guided for the base business to grow high single digit. Can you maybe just give us latest thoughts on vaccine and therapies? I know you previously talked about this $2 billion backlog heading into the year. So have any of the assumptions around vaccines and therapies changed?
Rainer Blair: So just to confirm, that's right. For 2022, we're guiding the base business to high single digits. And no, our assumptions as it relates to the vaccine and therapeutics business have not changed. We saw continued strength in our orders. In fact, orders exceeded our sales here in Q4, and we continued to build backlog. At the same time, we have to say that from a roughly 70% comp, we were down about mid-teens in terms of the orders growth. Nonetheless, orders still outpace sales. We built backlog and we're looking forward to roughly flat sales in the bioprocessing business for vaccine and therapeutic revenues in 2022. Now the core business, so in other words, the non-vaccine and therapeutic-related business for COVID, we expect that to continue to grow, of course, in the low double-digit area as has been the case here for many quarters.
Tycho Peterson: And have any of the Aldevron assumptions changed? I know you previously talked about $500 million this year, growing greater than 20%.
Rainer Blair: They're right on the mark $500 million is a good number. That's kind of growth and slightly better than we expected here, closing the year off right around $400 million. So, Aldevron is right where we think we should be and performing at our expectations.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Maybe last one for McGrew. Environmental and applied operating margins were down quite a bit, I think, 410 basis points. Can you maybe just touch on what drove that decline?
Matt McGrew: Yes, sure. Like you said, it was down 410 here in the quarter. It's probably three things. I would say, first, that's probably the area that we accelerated the investment spend the most in the fourth quarter, given obviously, a pretty strong print here across the entire portfolio. I think we took an opportunity in the fourth quarter to kind of overcharge a little bit of the investment there at EAS. So I think that's probably the first thing. I think the second thing is the supply chain. The challenges I would say there are probably modestly more pronounced at than they are elsewhere, Tycho. There's a kind of a high number of legacy products here that probably, I would say, have more components. And really what's happening is kind of the specialty components are a little bit harder to procure, especially in this environment that we're seeing. So largely offsetting that with daily management and doing some spot buys and some other product redesigns, et cetera, but I think a little bit more kind of supply chain issues there. And then lastly, I think if you think about -- there was a bit of mix issue here, too, with Trojan, which is a bit lower margin business being up, I think it was even north of 20% in the quarter. And so, I think despite that though, the good news is, like I said, I think teams doing a pretty good job using DBS to drive it from what we think and what we've seen here, it looks like even because of all that, I think we took some share here in Q4 and definitely in Q1, and that's really a result of being able to get through those challenges and still meet customer demand.
Operator: And we would like to take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Thanks for taking my question. This is Mike calling for Derik. First of all, focus on Cepheid, both in '22 and post-pandemic. Given you're saying 19 million tests again in 1Q, it seems like you're assuming a pretty short drop off in 2Q, 3Q. And then you set up pretty confident duration, the COVID being endemic now, the POC market expanding spiffy going forward being to keep market share. So could you give us some more color on continued market share gains, the 10,000 boxes you place this year, so what are your expectations going forward? And just is that $50 million testing, does that sort of assume that that's going to be the run rate beyond that? Or do you expect continued sort of deterioration in COVID revenues offset by the other [indiscernible]?
Rainer Blair: I'll start with, as you know, the situation around COVID is incredibly dynamic, right? It started with the assumptions that we made around Delta and then Delta spiked, and we thought that might become the dominant variant and then Omicron came 60 days ago, spiked. So the environment is incredibly dynamic. But in the discussions that we have both with public health officials, but also with our customers, I think there's a couple of takeaways. The first one is that we do think that COVID is going to turn endemic and a lot of public health officials will talk about the end of 2023, perhaps the beginning of '24, being that time frame when we call it endemic with greater confidence. As we look at our customer feedback and what they see happening here, that's where we're triangulating for 2022 into the 50 million test area. And as we've talked about, we see our base business in 2022 growing at high single digits and eventually having as a result of a step down from to 60 to 50 in 2022, at 200 to 300 basis point headwind there. Now as you think about that going forward beyond 2022, we think there's -- and once again, in the discussions with our customers that there's still a likelihood that there will be a large respiratory testing business, much larger than pre-pandemic in '23 and beyond. And once again, in the early days, and this could change. It's so dynamic. But we're thinking that, that probably steps down again in 2023. And our working number there for now is right around 30 million tests. So, as we think about the year 2023 and COVID testing, we see that going from 50 million in 2022 to perhaps 2023, 30 million. But that's a number that, of course, there's a lot of dynamic. There's a lot to happen between now and then, but that's sort of the planning number that we're working with. And at the same time, as you think about 2023, we see our base business, of course, the primary aspect of our total business continuing to grow off the strength of our portfolio. We've rated our growth rate and discussed that at several occasions, so we feel really good about how we're moving forward and like the setup.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Really appreciate the color there. And maybe one for Matt. You had some color on the pricing power going forward. I think you called out 100 basis points price in the fourth quarter and throughout the second half of the last three quarters. Could you comment on how much further runway do you see in '22 if we continue to be in an inflationary environment to pass on price to your customers? Any pushback you're seeing yet in any of the end markets? And just in general, the comments on how the fall-through in the business, labor pressure, logistics, obviously, in the news a lot. So how are you navigating that this year and implications for margins for the year?
Matt McGrew: Yes. Sure. No, I mean I think as far as price goes, like you said, we saw kind of 150 basis points here in Q4. And I think that we've seen that for the last couple of quarters, I think that's a pretty good placeholder to put in for '22. Teams are obviously, over the last six months, we've been working harder to get that price. And I think you're seeing it show up. I mean it's basically 2x the price we used to get, kind of, call it, five, six quarters ago. So I guess it's a good place to start for '22. As far as margins go, just kind of maybe overall, I know we sort of put out a guide for '22, I call it, 35% to 40% fall through. And that's down a little bit from where we stand, kind of more in that 40% to 45%. I think that 35% to 40% kind of incorporates a little bit of what you're talking about. I think it's kind of in line with what we thought, frankly, our longer-term outlook was going to be. But if I think about year-over-year from '21 to '22, I think you're right I think a component of sort of the step down is going to be a little bit of the return to work and maybe some of the inflationary pressures that we see offset by price. The other piece really is going to be largely on the volume step-down that we see, and that's mostly going to be at kind of a mix type issue. So throw in some headwinds on share count and lets to sort of I'm thinking about the 40% to 45% in '21 going down to 35% to 40%. But I think the good news is that's pretty much in our long-term framework right where we thought. And I think it's also probably important to think about it. But even though we're seeing headwinds on the testing front this year, call it, 200 to 300 basis points, our COVID testing revenue is pretty much at the fleet average, right, which is why it's not a big step down for us. It's pretty much fleet average from a margin perspective. So I think that helps kind of as we navigate the headwinds.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, Rainer. Congrats on a solid print here. I guess one on just the guidance here, fiscal '22, some clarification. So your definition of core now includes vaccines, and I think that's comparable to how your largest peer looks at core organic. But vaccines, if I just understood you correctly, it's flattish year-on-year, which means your base Danaher ex-vaccine, that's really growing at the very high end of high single. Is that right way to think about the guidance here on the base business? And what's driving this trend? It looks like it's assuming perhaps bioprocessing growing double digits, that's well above your LRP. So I'm curious some comments on bioprocessing.
Rainer Blair: Sure. So once again, just to level set, the base business includes bioprocessing for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. It's important to note that. And in fact, we see the entire base business growing both for the quarter and the full year at high single digits. And that's driven by a number of factors. One, as you just suggested, of course, the non-COVID bioprocessing business is still growing at the low double digits that we have seen here, and that continues to be strong. We also see our non-bioprocessing business, so as you think about our diagnostic businesses, as you think about our life science instruments and so forth, we see them growing very strongly on the back of the investments that we've made around innovation, additional feet on the street, and really driving the growth here. Keep in mind that portfolio transformation that we've talked about has re-rated our base business growth, and we continue to see that. We saw that here in the two-year stack in 2021, and you're seeing that here in the guide for 2022.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. So I guess now we have clarity on what the mid-single digit plus, what the plus means. That's helpful, Rainer. Maybe one for Matt. The 35% to 40% incremental margin share, Matt. Is that sustainable going forward? Should we -- I guess my question is most of your peers who benefited from COVID tailwinds? There is a cliff here or perhaps a transition year. It seems like Danaher does not have a cliff here. Maybe talk about the sustainability of incrementals and why perhaps the all the drop down and co-tails shouldn't be a headwind for Danaher?
Matt McGrew: Yes, I mean, I think that's right, Vijay. I think like I just kind of said, I mean, our COVID kind of revenues, both vaccine, therapeutic and the testing, it's more or less a fleet average, right? And so what I think you're seeing here and part of the reason we talked about the re-rating of the portfolio from a growth perspective, as I just mentioned lot, we've also talked about the fact that the portfolio is rerated from a margin perspective, too, right? We used to be more 30%, 35%. Now, we're 35%, 40%. And I think what you see here is that as we go forward and think about kind of what a margin profile looks like, I think I feel very comfortable with the 35% to 40% and the fact that, like you said, we'll have some revenue headwinds. We're going to have some volume headwinds and testing like we sort of laid out, and we can talk about '23, maybe if you're interested. But I think as we get to those headwinds, it won't be above the fleet average headwind, if you will, from a decremental perspective. So while it will be a headwind, and I think you can -- you obviously see that a little bit here in '22, from a margin perspective, it's not going to be overly burdensome.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Davis: Good morning everybody. Congrats on a great year overall. But anyways, Rainer, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about M&A given that growth assets seemingly are out of favor in public markets fairly meaningfully. Is that kind of gone down into private markets at all and helped you out on the valuation side much? If you can talk about that in the pipeline, please.
Rainer Blair: Sure. Well, I mean, first to the environment that we see out there, this is an environment that over our history, we have thrived in, whether you want to call that anxiety or uncertainty or even in times of dislocation. We've always viewed this as a time of opportunity for ourselves. And there's examples of that. If you think back to the financial crisis now going back some years, we acquired SCIEX at that period of time. That's turned out to be a fantastic asset. The team has done a wonderful job. Also, if you think about some of the anxiety around Cepheid or the Pall deals there, that has been -- we couldn't be more proud of how the teams have performed there and turn those businesses into really real powerhouses. And so, we sit here in this environment with a rock-solid portfolio, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, a great deal of optionality. And we like that set up. And so, as we think about our funnels and to your question, they continue to be adaptive as ever. They cover the gamut, whether that's public or private, and we'll continue driving our M&A strategy and our bias towards allocating capital towards M&A as we have in the past. And that will happen when that attractive end market, that first-class asset with competitive advantage meets our financial hurdles here as has always been the case. So we like where we sit, and we like the set up.
Scott Davis: That's helpful, Rainer. And Rainer, you talked about new product launches like Beckman. How has COVID impacted those launches? Is there a -- were these things perhaps that were pushed back a little bit because of COVID? Were they on schedule with the customer response and ability to get out and see the customer with that product? Has that all been altered or changed? And just a little bit of color there would be helpful? And then I'll pass it on.
Rainer Blair: Sure. In our case, COVID has actually accelerated innovation for us. Of course, in the obvious sense in that we were able to pull forward the GeneXpert COVID-only test subsequently and very quickly thereafter the four-in-one. Those are sort of the obvious examples. But at the same time, you've noted that we increased our R&D expenditures by 30% up to $1.7 billion, which has manifested in that pulling forward innovation, accelerating it and getting those into the market. And examples were mentioned, the Triple Quad 7500, most sensitive Triple Quad in the market, the ZenoTOF outstanding. And then, of course, the GT 450 pathology slide imaging, fantastic launches here, all of which was accelerated by the pandemic, and we were able to turn that into real opportunity for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dan Brennan: I guess the first question, just on the vaccine therapeutics outlook now that you're including it in the base. We were assuming our model a pretty steep drop off in '23 and '24 just as we go from initial two dose regimens down to boosters, and booster uptake looks good, probably not going to be nearly as good as the initial vaccine. So I guess, first, first question, I mean is that reasonable to think there's going to be a healthy step down, number one? And then number two, the fact that you're including it in the base, just wondering, I know previously you've discussed IT but kind of high single digits, is that still fair to think about the high single digits now that you've got vaccine and therapeutics in the base?
Rainer Blair: Sure. Well, let's start off with the why vaccine and therapeutics in the base. And that just comes from our belief of two things. One, that COVID-19 will be endemic in that there will be a continuous requirement for vaccination, and that is going to be a global requirement. We also think that new age groups will receive vaccination more broadly in the world's kids in particular. And as such, there is a strong recurring demand there, and that was discussed at some of the previous questions. But if we back up a minute here and we think about this longer term, I talked about our '22 guide here with high single-digit growth in our base business, and we talked about the 200 to 300 basis points of headwind coming from testing. As you think forward now, how does all that play out, let's say, in 2023? And once again, it's important to start with the base, which is at the center of your question, which is, okay, well, we have this rock solid portfolio that's transformed over the years, that's going to be mid-single-digit plus growth and is going to have a different earnings profile as well, as Matt just talked about. And then inside of that, of course, you do have vaccine and therapeutic revenues from COVID and that will continue. There are new therapeutics being developed and there are also a lot of additional vaccines that are still in the pipe. And then as you think about COVID testing, as I talked about, we see that stepping down towards, we'll call it, a more endemic look from 50 million tests in 2022 to 30 million tests in 2023. Now when you wrap all of that up, and of course, there's a lot of things that are still up in the air in terms of the number of spikes you might have in between 2023 really looks a lot like 2022 in terms of how we think of the base growth going forward as well as our fall through.
Dan Brennan: Excellent. And then maybe as a follow up, just one more on bioproduction, if you don't mind. Certainly, the low double digit is impressive growth, particularly on the side of your business. Some of the CapEx that we've seen in the industry that is really accelerating, Rainer has talked about, I think, the margins 40% cost type of CapEx growth in '22 on top of 40% in '21. So I'm just wondering, could you give a little color or maybe the order book there like on the base business, kind of what you're seeing? And are we in like a period of like hyper investment or maybe that low double digit, could have some upside here over the next couple of years?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So we do continue to talk about the low double-digit growth rate for the non-COVID bioprocessing business. That's what we've seen for many quarters. But we also talked about the fact that our backlog continues to build there. And these announcements that you're seeing here out in the market, those are important indications of the strength of the industry and the market in and of itself. And of course, you can imagine with the breadth of our portfolio our global reach that we play, if not on all on the great majority of those kind of investments. And so could there be upside? Sure, there could be. But of course, we're looking at the order book and that's in hand and thinking about how that develops, and we'll continue to update. But for now, low double digits in the non-COVID processing business, is a good planning number.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: So one of the big questions we've been getting is the Fed is looking to start raising rates. Just would be great to get your thoughts around durability demand from biopharma customers? And how much of a factor do you think higher rates could have on demand? And then finally, maybe any color on mix between development and commercial and interplay on those two sides of the market?
Rainer Blair: Could you -- I'm sorry, could you repeat the second question, please? It came through a little garbled.
Jack Meehan: Sure. Sorry. Just thoughts on how higher rates might influence demand from customers on the development side versus those with commercial products.
Rainer Blair: Understood. Well, let's start with the rate. Well, it's early days, of course, and we'll see where those go. As we look at the markets that we play in or broadly, the impact of those rates could be different. But generally speaking, we see our end markets to be able to perform and drive growth even in a market where we see incrementally higher Fed rates. An example of that would be, if you look at biotech and aggregate, you see that the cash positions in these companies, is extraordinarily high. We continue to see investments going in there strongly. And so we don't anticipate any near-term impact due to Fed rate in that particular area. And that would, of course, overlap with the development part of your question. And as it relates to those that are already in commercial production, they are out there driving growth and ensuring the penetration of the incredibly efficacious biologic drugs, not just in the developed markets, but increasingly also in some of the higher growth markets. So we see really the demand drivers here going beyond any one country's monetary policy and continue to see that in a very positive light. So Fed policy is one thing. The specific markets that we play in, we would be less impacted by any of the incremental rate increases that are being discussed.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then Dan just asked about CapEx going in on the CDMO side. I wanted to ask a similar question but focused all the CapEx going in from the bioprocessing players. Back at the Analyst Day, you talked about $1.5 billion of your own CapEx. Some of your peers are talking about a lot of more investment going in the single-use and just bioprocessing, broadly speaking. So, as you look across everything going on, just talk about supply versus demand and how you feel whether that -- just your views on that broadly speaking?
Rainer Blair: Sure. Well, let me characterize that a little bit. So the large CDMO investments that you see there are really a derivative of what we talked about in your question before, which is the strength of the biotech market. These are typically smaller companies that don't want to invest their precious cash into manufacturing facilities, and we'll outsource that to CDMOs. And as we talked about, if you think about the fact that just in monoclonal antibodies over the last five years, we've seen a huge increase in the number of projects in the funnel. If you think about nucleic acid therapies, there we've seen a 10x increase in the development funnel. And now you're seeing those work their way through the clinical trial process and that requires capacity. So that's what the CDMO investments are about. And of course, the customer -- our customers are also CDMOs and we're helping them build those capacities so that they can take care of those developments going forward. And then we also continue to see drugs going commercial. And as these drugs go commercial, that's a 10 and 100x increase in production capacity requirement. And all of this then, if you aggregate that, is what's pulling on our demand and is why we are so confident in the investments that we've made. And I mentioned this not just for the short term, which, of course, is important to ensure that they're owning the supply bottlenecks as we work our way through the pandemic here, but also for the long term so that we continue to be that partner of choice that has the broadest portfolio, can integrate that portfolio horizontally and can deliver it to the point of impact around the globe with the necessary experts to help our customers get their drugs in the market more quickly and at a lower cost.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.
Patrick Donnelly: Hi, Rainer. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the bioprocessing piece. I know you touched a little bit about what the cadence could look like going forward. But that's certainly the question I think we get the most from investors. So I just wanted to circle back on it. I mean it sounds like you feel really good about that underlying base business growing in the low double digits. And then the vaccine piece, maybe a little bit more of a variable. But can you just talk, I guess, about the trajectory? It sounded like '22 is a decent proxy where maybe COVID comes down, and you shake out somewhere in the mid-high single digits as a whole for that kind of $7.5 billion business. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we go through kind of the next few years. And again, that vaccine piece comes down, but the base business seems like it's good enough to offset that and then some, but just wanted to get a better handle there.
Rainer Blair: I think that's right. As we look at 2022, I mentioned the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic bioprocessing business. They'll probably be roughly flat here in 2022. Again, the assumption being that we're starting to see the pandemic going endemic on the one hand. On the other hand, what you start seeing -- you start seeing to happen is, if you will, we're going from 1.0 compounds to 2.0. So some vaccines and therapeutics are viewed as less efficacious in the current environment with the current variance, and so those become less of a factor. On the other hand, you have new monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics starting to be proposed that show much higher efficacy here with the variance that you have. And then for those that are already in market and quite effective, we're starting to see the recurring revenue as those companies are starting to recognize the recurring need for booster shots, not just here but around the globe. So we think that that's a good baseline to move forward with and how to think about it. And we've continued to view, as we've said in our long-term guide around the bioprocessing business, that that's a high single-digit grower. And I think that's the way to think about it in '22. And as we said, we think '23 will look a lot like '22 as well.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. And I know the order book typically you're taking orders for within a year. Is any of that building into '23 yet? Or should we think about that as mostly a 12-month order book and then maybe conversations beyond that?
Rainer Blair: It's a 12-month order book in conversations beyond that.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay. And last one, just the same topic for Matt. Margin profile, COVID versus not for the bioprocessing, it's pretty similar, right? I just want to double check on that.
Matt McGrew: Yes. In bioprocessing, margin difference between COVID and not, is that what you're asking?
Patrick Donnelly: Yes, exactly.
Matt McGrew: Yes. No. No real difference. I mean we're -- I would say that it's all, again, just depending on mix of what goes in there, product-wise, but no margin profile wise it's the same..
Operator: And this will conclude today's Q&A portion for the call. I'll turn the call back over to Matt Gugino with any additional remarks.
Matthew Gugino: Thanks, Ashley, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're around all day for questions.
Rainer Blair: Thank you everybody.
Operator: And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-21 08:00:00) =====

As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales, references to core revenue growth including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair : Matt, thank you and good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team delivered another outstanding result in our third quarter with over 20% core revenue growth, nearly 40% adjusted earnings per share growth, and strong free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day. I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our Virtual Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase the strong foundation we’ve built for generating sustainable, long-term outperformance. We highlighted our fantastic portfolio of market-leading franchises in highly attractive end markets, the exceptional team we have out on the field every day, and how we differentiate with the Danaher Business System. And we certainly saw this powerful combination in action during the third quarter as our results attest. Now we also talked about our sustainability efforts. And just last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report. This year's report reflects the measurable progress we've made across the three pillars of our sustainability program, which are innovation, people, and the environment, and how we use the Danaher Business System to execute on this increasingly important strategic priority. Now, I hope you all get a chance to read through the report and learn more about the important work that we're doing across Danaher, to positively impact the world around us for generations to come. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered 20.5% core revenue growth with portfolio-wide strength led by Diagnostics and Life Sciences. Geographically, high-growth markets grew approximately 25% and developed markets were up nearly 20%. In fact, revenue in each of our three largest markets; North America, Western Europe, and China, was up approximately 20% or more in the quarter. Our gross profit margin increased by 550 basis points to 60.3% primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix, and the impact of prior-year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Now, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.39 and were up 39% compared to 2020, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 5.2 billion, which is up 46.5% year-over-year. We continue to accelerate organic growth investments across the entire portfolio, and increased our research and development spend by approximately 30% year-over-year. At our Investor Day recently, we highlighted how we use DBS growth tools and processes to accelerate innovation and bring more impactful solutions to our customers faster. In fact, recently launched products like the SCIEX, ZenoTOF 7600, and the Triple Quad 7500 and Beckman Life Sciences, CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter are just a few great examples of how we're driving market share gains through proprietary innovation and enhancing our growth trajectory going forward. We're also making substantial investments to expand production capacity across our bio-processing businesses and at Cepheid. Near-term these investments are supporting existing customer demand and driving meaningful share gains. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see significant runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the sectors they serve. And we expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' need today and well into the future. So, now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 24.5% with core revenue up 20%. This growth was broad based across the segment with most major operating companies achieving high teens or better core growth. Now these strong results were led by continued demand for our bioprocessing solutions as in Cytiva bioprocessing and Pall Biotech, both grew more than 30% in the quarter, including low double-digit, non-COVID related core growth. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue continued to be strong and now exceeds $1.5 billion year-to-date. At Cytiva, we passed an important milestone last month when we exited the last of our transition services agreement with GE. We successfully completed this process ahead of schedule, which is a testament to the entire Cytiva and integration team and their collective commitment to the Danaher Business System. Cytiva also added more than 1,500 new associates to the global team since joining Danaher to help ensure that we are supporting our customers today and continue meeting their needs well into the future. Now, in August, we successfully closed our acquisition of Aldevron, and we're thrilled to officially welcome the team to Danaher. Aldevron is a leading producer of high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA, and proteins, and provides a fantastic beachhead for us in our genomic medicine enterprise. We're seeing the rapid development of gene and cell therapies, DNA, and RNA vaccines, and gene editing technologies, and Aldevron expand our capabilities in these areas to ultimately help our customers bring more life-saving therapies and vaccines to market faster. We're really excited about the quality, the scale, the turnaround time, and the reputation that Aldevron brings to the Danaher portfolio. Now in Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 28.5% led by more than 60% growth at Cepheid. Each of our other major diagnostic businesses, Beckman Coulter, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems grew low-to-mid teens in the quarter as clinical diagnostic activity and patient volumes around the world largely returned to pre -pandemic levels. In respiratory testing at Cepheid, we further expanded manufacturing capacity, which enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 16 million cartridges during the quarter. COVID-only test accounted for approximately 80% of those shipment, and our 4-in-1 combination tests for COVID-19, Flu-A and B, and RSV represented approximately 20%. In non respiratory core growth, Cepheid was up double-digits as well, led by demand for hospital acquired infections, sexual health, and urology testing. We also saw strong growth in our installed base, as system placements continue to exceed pre -pandemic rate. And we believe the team's thoughtful placement of the GeneXpert and Infinity systems over the last 18 months is setting up Cepheid very well for future growth opportunities. First move to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 7% with core revenue up 7.5%. Water quality grew mid-single-digits, and our Product Identification platform was up low double-digits. Across our water quality businesses, we saw good underlying market strength, particularly in food and beverage and various industrial applications as activity returned to more normal level. Municipal projects picked up given the improving funding environment and as more customers return to in-person work. Now on product identification, both VIDEOJET and our packaging and color management businesses were up low double-digits in the quarter. Comparable stirrings across consumables, service, and installed base growth was driven by more normalized levels of customer activity and investments. We believe that our ability to meet our customers needs, particularly on the equipment side at VIDEOJET, enabled us to gain market share and expand our industry-leading installed base printers. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through regional and end-market trends. Most major regions and countries around the world are largely back to pre -pandemic activity levels. Customers have adapted to the current operating environment and protocols and broadly resumed in-person commercial activities and site access. Now this is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe, and China. And this momentum is also reflected in our strong order book growth w which is trending above revenue growth. Now we're mindful of potential COVID-19 variants or outbreaks and selective lockdown. But we're not currently seeing any material negative impact from these scenarios. And while we are seeing some global supply chain constraints, we're leveraging the Danaher Business System tools like daily management and actively working with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate any impact. Across Life Sciences, we're seeing robust customer activity and demand across all major end market. Lab and other site access is largely back to pre -COVID levels, and we're seeing this through more normalized productivity levels, installations, and project initiations driven by a strong funding environment. Now, Biopharma continues to lead the way as the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies and development and production continues to rise, and it's augmented by the ongoing work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And at our recent Investor Day, we spent time covering how well-positioned we are to support this complex life changing work that our customers are pursuing. Our combined bio-processing portfolio across Cytiva and Pall Biotech is the broadest offering in the industry with leading positions in upstream and downstream applications. And we further support our customers with best-in-class scientific services, partnering to solve their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. And our global reach enabled us to reliably and consistently meet our customers' needs. Now, in addition to the industry-wide opportunities in biologics and genomic -based medicine, we continue to see significant demand related to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our customers are working to address emerging variants and increased global supply. And given that only about a third of the global population has been vaccinated, we believe we'll see durable growth in this Biopharma segment for the foreseeable future. We continue to expect about $2 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021. And since we spoke at our Investor Day, we now expect to enter 2022 with approximately $2 billion in COVID-related backlog versus our previous expectation of $1.5 billion of backlog. This increase is driven by the recent enhanced visibility for booster shots and the likelihood of vaccine availability for children under 12 years old in the US. Moving to the clinical diagnostic market, non - COVID testing volumes are essentially back to pre -pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening, and other elective procedures. In Molecular Diagnostics, strong global demand persists for Cepheid point-of-care PCR respiratory testing, as a result of the Delta variant and outbreak, along with lower vaccination rates in many regions. As I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 16 million respiratory tests during the third quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 55 million tests in 2021 versus our prior expectation of 50 million. As we head into the traditional respiratory virus season, we're hearing from customers that they expect this to be a much more active season than last year's, in preparation their preferences for our four-in-one combination tests. So we're seeing an uptick in demand for those cartridges, particularly given the recent outbreak of RSV across the U.S. Cepheid 's 4-in-1 test was also recently approved with a third gene target for SARS-CoV-2 detection, ensuring it can continue to accurately detect future COVID-19 viral mutations and reinforcing Cepheid's competitive advantage in the respiratory testing market. Now moving to the applied market. Customer activity has largely rebounded to pre -pandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates across both consumables and equipment. In the global municipal market, consumables demand remained solid and the pace of instrument oriented project activity continues to pick up with the improving funding environment and broad return to work. Now, let's look ahead to our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter core revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range with high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, and a mid-to-high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter, a similar level to what we achieved in the third quarter. Now for the full-year of 2021, we now expect to deliver more than 20% core tail wind and our base business will each contribute more than 10% to our 2021 core revenue growth rate. So to wrap up, we're proud to deliver another terrific results here in the third quarter. Our performance is a testament to the power of our unique portfolio, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. And this unique combination differentiates Danaher today, and it reinforces our opportunities ahead for sustainable, long-term, outperformance. So with that, back over to you, Matt.
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Emma, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Rainer Blair : Hey, good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson : Hey. Rainer, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more on China. There seems to be growing noise on pressure, local competition. It seems to particularly be impacting some of the Diagnostics tenders with that process getting pushed out from the provinces. Are you seeing anything there for Beckman or Cepheid? I know China was up 20% overall, but I'm just curious if there's any pressure on the Diagnostics business based on what you're seeing?
Rainer Blair : Sure. So let me start with -- we are not seeing any material impact related to some of the tenders or some of the other things that we hear out of China. In fact, the Anhui Province tender is really an exception in diagnostics and actually more common in other industries, and we'll see this kind of thing from time-to-time, but it's neither unexpected nor do we see it as material. But what we're seeing generally in China is really very consistent with what we've seen over the past several years. China has been very forthcoming with its Made in China 2025 Initiative as well as several others, all of which we see quite aligned with our strategy. Starting with our portfolio, which is clearly aligned with the healthy China 2030 agenda, where you see the need for both improved Diagnostics solutions as well as Life Sciences research and bioprocessing, as well as the desire to protect the environment where water quality really plays big, as well as the desire to improve and protect the food supply where we see PID playing large as well. We think we're really ideally positioned here to meet the needs of where China is going. Now, at the same time for years, we have been investing in China as our business gains scale to ultimately localize our production. And that's been the case here for some time, positioning us very well in China, and that will continue to be the case going forward as our businesses continue to gain scale there.
Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. Supply chain, you flagged some constraints, obviously, you guys are generally very good at kind of mitigating any impact here. But I'm curious as you look out over the next couple of quarters, are there areas where maybe you are more or less concerned around supply chain that you might flag?
Rainer Blair : We haven't really seen a material impact on our ability to meet our customers' demand, but we are seeing some modest inflationary and supply chain pressures in certain areas just to name a couple, of course, electronic components, freight, and logistics and some labor shortages. But really this is where the Danaher Business System is a differentiator for us in this environment. In fact, despite the additional work that ensues, we see this really as an opportunity for ourselves to differentiate with our DBS toolset, for instance with daily management, which brings our cross-functional teams together on a daily basis, drive disciplined execution and accountability, as well as the sense of urgency in real-time problem solving. And at the same time of course, we're qualifying additional suppliers and building safety stocks. So, this is how we make sure that Danaher continues to not only meet its customer expectations, but also has opportunity to gain share. Now at the same time, of course, we see some inflationary pressures and we're offsetting those with more active cadence, of price increases, and those would also be incrementally larger than in the past, as well as freight and fuel surcharges. So, on the one hand, we're driving as always to reduce our cost of goods sold. At the same time, we take additional offsets with moving on some of these surcharges and price increases I mentioned. I think also importantly, to note here that this is not a top down process. The Danaher operating companies have this process muscle and are able to execute effectively whether that's ensuring the security of the supply chain or whether that's ensuring that we can offset cost increases via price and other methods. And ultimately, we think that differentiates us and we think we are gaining share as a result of that in PID water quality, Cytiva and Pall, Radiometer and elsewhere.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's great. And then before I hop off, just one on Cepheid , you're exceeding your targets here in the near-term. Should we assume your estimates for 2022 are still intact? I think you talked about 45 million tests before or have you kind of revisited those as well?
Rainer Blair : That's correct, Tycho. We're really pleased that the team was able to ship more again here in the third quarter with the capacity increases, and demand still exceeds our ability to supply. But for today's view, 45 million cartridges for 2022 is our point of view.
Tycho Peterson : Perfect. Thank you.
Rainer Blair : Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Rainer Blair : Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar : Good morning, Rainer. Congrats on another impressive print here. Just one on testing here. I think I heard the number 55 million tests for '21. The implied Q4 number, I think is about 15 million. That's a sequential step-down from 3Q. I'm curious, just given the testing trends, whether that step-down makes sense and any change to your -- I think your prior expectation was 45 million tests for fiscal '22. Is that still relevant given the current run-rate?
Rainer Blair : Sure. Thanks Vijay. So, the way to think about the fourth quarter here in terms of testing, is we would expect also 16 million cartridges in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in Q3. While we're always working to increase capacity, we think 16 million cartridges is the right way to think about it. And of course, if you add up the quarters, let's call it about 55 million, I wouldn't want you thinking about a step down here in Q4 for Cepheid. That's not the case. Now as you look forward to 2022, we still think that 45 million cartridges where we sit today, is the right way to think about it. And as we come to our fourth-quarter earnings call in January, we'll revisit the topic then.
Vijay Kumar : Understood. And now my second question, Rainer. This is maybe a bigger picture question. I think at your Analyst Day, you updated Cytiva outlook as high singles. Now, when you look at your peers in the Biopharma space, most of them are in the double-digit range. Is there anything different about your Cytiva business mix versus your peers and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Cytiva gaining share versus peers?
Rainer Blair : So to start with, the Cytiva and the Poll Biotech businesses together are by far the most complete portfolio in the marketplace. And we continue to see pockets where we're taking share because we've been able to invest not only in capacity, but our customers really appreciate the scientific capability and the help that they get from Cytiva and Pall in solving the challenges that are associated with making biologics of high-quality with high yields at the targeted costs. So we really see ourselves in an advantage position here and believe that we continue to take share whether that's on a quarterly or on an annual basis, that's for sure the case. Now, as we think about the long-term growth, and perhaps our timelines needs to be aligned here. As we think of long-term growth, you might recall, when we acquired Cytiva, we thought this was more of a fixed percent type of growth business. And what we've seen here is that certainly the growth of this business is rerated higher. And certainly in the pandemic, it's quite a bit higher. Once again, as we think about the long term, we think it's prudent to think about a business at that scale in a high single-digit. And we think that will compare very favorably with any other business out there in the short, medium, and long term.
Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Rainer. And just to summarize that, there's no reason to think Cytiva growth should be below market. Is that a fair summary?
Rainer Blair : We continue to believe that we'll take share now and in the future.
Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys.
Rainer Blair : Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: We'll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Rainer Blair : Derrick, good morning.
Derik De Bruin: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a couple of ones. Can we talk a little bit about operating leverage as we go into '22 and '23? You guys are investing really heavily in R&D. You're doing a lot to drive innovation in the business. How can we think about OP leverage as we go in there and then, just to get a sense of where the margins are going to come on?
Rainer Blair : Sure. Derrick, as you know, we have been and as you just mentioned, investing very significantly in the business. This is not only the case in capital expenditures, where we're investing in our manufacturing network throughout the world. But we've also been investing significantly in research and development in feet on the street to drive proprietary innovation in the short and long-term, as well as to ensure that we can continue to drive share gains with our direct business model. Now as we think about the operating leverage, you know that our fall through here had been in the 40% range. And we think that's a good way to think about the quarter here as well. In the long term, historically, our fall-through has been more in the 35% range. And we think that's probably the better way to think about fall -through for the long term, just because we want to find that balance of reinvesting in the business, as well as driving profitability expansion. And we think that Flywheel works for us. Mid-single-digit plus growth on the one hand; on the other hand, 50 to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion, free cash flow conversion over net income over a 100%. All of that then to drive double-digit plus EPS growth. And when you couple that with our current balance sheet of positioning with our bias to deploy capital towards M&A, we think that sets us up very nicely here, both from an operating leverage perspective, as well as driving our growth franchise forward.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Can we talk a little bit about the analytical instrumentation sales? I'm curious just on how SCIEX is comparing to 2019 and some of the other instrumentation. And specifically, I'd like to know developed world versus China and what that is -- just trying to gauge overall, are we seeing accelerating analytical demand from 2019 versus where we are today?
Rainer Blair : Well, let me start with that. We are seeing accelerated analytical demand versus prior year today. That's the case in all of our more instrument bias -- businesses and that is certainly the case for SCIEX as well. We do see that the funding environment labs opening up are helpful here and have accelerated instrument demand going forward. And SCIEX has done very nice here with over mid-team core growth in the quarter and that also read through to China as well. SCIEX in particular, as you know, has been on a great streak of -- and continuous streak of innovation launching at the ZenoTOF 7600, as well as the 7500 Triple Quad an d Echo MS, and is not only benefiting from the tailwinds of and attractive funding environment, which we see here in this year and certainly in the second half of 2021. But they're also benefiting through this innovation that is really allowing our scientists to answer new questions and that's resulting in share gain.
Matt Mc Grew : This is Matt. Just to put some numbers to what Rainer said. I mean, if you look at SCIEX in particular, on a two-year stack, you're talking about high single-digits here in ' 20and '21, which is that's actually better than where they were in '18 and '19 on a two-year stack. So I think like Rainer said, we're seeing some pretty nice acceleration, really new product-driven as well, but it's been a really good story here for the last couple of years.
Derik De Bruin: Great. And if I can sneak in one more. The COVID vaccine backlog for '22. Is there even some additional upside there? Is that already committed orders, or is that more tied to your instrumentations on [Indiscernible] etc.
Rainer Blair : We are close to those $2 billion of backlog and for the bio-process business for 2022 today and certainly expect to be there by the end of the year. We think that sets us up pretty well. We will see what 2022 brings and we'll talk more about that in January. But the fact that we've up that backlog by 500 million here going into 2022, we think is a good sign for things to come.
Matt Mc Grew : Derik, so definitely, those are committed orders. That is not a --
Derik De Bruin: Great, Jack. Thank you. That's what we're working. Thanks.
Matt Mc Grew : Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Rainer Blair : Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis : Good morning. Rainer and Matt and Matt and John. Thanks for taking my question. I am kind of curious. I mean, logistics, prices, and labor cost, inflation or challenges and all the stuff doesn't seem to really have impacted you guys much. Maybe a little bit at ENAS. And you've made a comment, Rainer on capturing price, but it looks like price was sequentially flat. Is that something that you would expect price to be a little bit more dynamic going forward or is it just kind of a mix impact to some products where priced just doesn't need to go up?
Rainer Blair : We're about a 150 basis points up year-over-year and we continue to move price increases through the system. So I think you're going to continue to see that filtering through here going forward, Scott. So mix plays a role as you suggest; timing is another one, but all of these actions are in the works and it takes some time to get through the system.
Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And the R&D -- the spend up 30%, is that -- is it headcount up 30% too or people are costing you more? How do you think about that and how do you think about getting productivity on that spend as making sure projects are focused and there's some sort of return on that investment?
Rainer Blair : Scott, that's a great question. And the 30% increase is primarily related to a number of points. One, of course, you have more people working on more projects. But in terms of the productivity, the way to think about that is any project that we do, has its business case and we ensure that that productivity to the delivery of that business case makes sense for us. So we view this, of course, as an investment in the future that ultimately drive defensible proprietary share gain through research and development. And the increased comes in terms of people that comes in terms of additional equipment, testing equipment that's required. It comes in terms of additional alpha and beta system that are out in the field with our customers. So myriad ways that we invest that in order to drive innovation.
Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck, Rainer. Thank you and congrats on a great year so far, guys. Thanks. That's [Indiscernible].
Rainer Blair : Thanks, Scott.
Operator: We'll go next to Dan Brennan with Cowen.
Rainer Blair : Morning, Dan.
Dan Brennan: [Indiscernible], thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions here. I wanted to ask as a follow-up to the first question on this bio process. You maintained the outlook for vaccine therapeutic contribution this year. Just wondering, is there capacity for you to exceed that in terms of is there demand for that or your capacity constrained for 2021? And then related to that, as we think about 2022, you've already discussed the 2 billion firm order book, but how do we think about the contribution within that from boosters and from kids to that. I think that in previously, you had boosters included in that. So maybe that's the first question. Thank you.
Rainer Blair : Very good. Well, let's start with the topic of the contribution that's in the 2 billion. In fact, we did not include the kid 12 and below into our $1.5 billion original backlog estimate for 2022. That and, of course, now the approval of boosters for various groups of the population is really what is driving that increase from $1.5 to $2 billion of backlog for 2022. What it doesn't include is the approval of these vaccines for kids 12 and younger, for example, outside of the US. That's something that is still in the future, and there's not sufficient clarity for us to start thinking about that in quantitative terms, but that's something that would be excluded in that. Now coming back to your capacity question, as you likely are aware and as we talked about also in our Analyst Day, we have been investing in capacity expansions in the biotech business now, for some time. In fact, we ensured that the investment continued even prior to the closing of the acquisition from GE and we have continued with those investments that have come online here, nearly in a continuous fashion through the second half of 2020 and 2021. And we expect those capacities to continue to increase here going into 2022. So we feel very comfortable that we're able to meet our customers' requirements here now and going forward, and we think that differentiates us in the marketplace. And why, among other reasons, we are confident that we are taking share.
Dan Brennan: Great, thanks, Rainer. And then as a follow-up, I know Matt discussed previously, a stack growth on, I believe is on Cytiva. I just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of stack-free overall business. I know the commentary throughout the conversation reflected business largely back to normal, which is great. But when we look at like the base growth ex - COVID then we consider like a stack, and this is clearly very imprecise. But in Q3, that base growth on a 2-year average basis was around 4, maybe a little bit below that. And I believe in Q4, the high single-digit base guidance implies like a 2-year stack that might be closer to 3. And this is compared against what we consider Danaher 's underlying growth rate probably somewhere in the 6% to 8% range when things get back to normal. So just trying to reconcile some of this underlying stack and is it just conservatism right now? Are things back to --
Rainer Blair : Yes.
Dan Brennan: -- normal or maybe it's just too imprecise to do this analysis with COVID? Thank you.
Matt Mc Grew : Yes. Dan, let me just give you the numbers because I think may be disconnect here. I think the simple frame for Q4 is like we, talked about, we increased our expectations from low double-digits to low to mid-teens. And like you said, we are up in the base business. We think the base business is going to be high-single-digits in Q4, which as you said, was probably a little closer to 10% here in Q3. And I would look at that delta between kind of high-single-digits and 10 and say that that's really just more a function of kind of prudent planning given the current operating environment and some of the things we've talked about. In particular, you think about Q4 and logistic challenges, etc. that might be there. So I think we're just trying to give a little bit of -- from a planning perspective, high-single-digits from about the10% we've seen, but really not much of a change here in the environment.
Dan Brennan: Okay. Great, thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Jack Meehan with Nephron.
Rainer Blair : Morning, Jack.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to a little bit more color on the funding environment, was curious as you look into the fourth quarter, what customers might be telling you around the potential for a budget flush and what is the guidance assume versus historical patterns?
Rainer Blair : So Jack, first of all, we see the funding environment across the board improving. So if we start with yes, we do see customer activity increasing, we do see more work occurring at the workplace, and with that, more projects being tackled both in the capital as well as operating investment categories. And we would expect that to continue to improve here going forward as the economy continues to pick up speed and return to normality. As we think about Life Sciences, research funding is up, whether that's government funding, whether that's venture capital funding, or whether that is Biopharma funding from the pharmaceutical companies. We've see n a step-up here in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that new breakthroughs and technologies that you're all aware of, as a result of COVID, all -- creating a great deal more awareness of the possibilities here in therapeutics. We see, generally speaking, a great environment in the Life Science area. Bioprocess, we talked about with continued capacity increases to meet the needs of the very fast-growing therapeutic pipeline. We talked about the fact that monoclonal antibody pipeline is up 50% in terms of the number of projects over the last five-years. Genomic gene cell therapy pipeline is up an order of magnitude to 10x versus 5 years ago. That's creating very healthy drive here whether that's in the research - side of Life Sciences or in the bioprocessing. And then when you come back to diagnostics, patient volumes are nearly at full rate pre -pandemic rates, if you will, in nearly every geography. And we continue to, of course, the COVID driving additional diagnostic demand and so across the board a very positive funding environment. And we would expect that the one of the other budget is going to be taken advantage of here in the fourth quarter. We'll see. There are a number of different perspective there but the environment is generally very positive.
Jack Meehan: That's great. And then as a follow-up, just curious on Aldevron on how the early integration feedback's going. And as I look at the fourth quarter, you've given us the core guidance. What do you have M&A contributing? 2.5 points or so? Does that sound right?
Matt Mc Grew : Yeah that would be probably -- sorry. Go ahead, Rainer.
Rainer Blair : No, go ahead. Go ahead, Matt, please.
Matt Mc Grew : The M&A contribution is probably going to be about -- it was 40 here in Q3. But I think you're probably pretty close with what you've got, 40 million.
Rainer Blair : So we -- actually coming back to the front end of your question there, we couldn't be happier with both Aldevron as an entity, but even more importantly, the team in Aldevron that have embraced joining the Danaher family are embracing and pulling hard on the Danaher Business System and are really focused on driving and growing their business. There's plenty of opportunity as you likely know, in the core businesses of Aldevron. And we see that. We see that in the order book. We see that in revenues. And we will see that also in their earnings contributions, all of which is running as we expected, when we updated during the acquisition. So we expect to see $400 million of revenue this year, growth rate in 20% plus range, and we expect to see $0.20 of EPS in year 1, growing to $0.30 of EPS in year 2. So Aldevron -- incredibly pleased with the motivation and the engagement of the team and the important work that they're doing. And proud to have them as a part of the Danaher family.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.
Matt Sykes: Good morning. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow up on Jack's question on Aldevron. You guys had mentioned when you made the acquisition that they were relatively underexposed to international and I know you're -- you've got a lot of things going on with the integration. But as you think about expanding Aldevron footprint internationally, how are you thinking about that and are there any kind of timelines that you have for that?
Rainer Blair : Very much a part of the investment hypothesis is to expand Aldevron's activities, as you say, internationally. And we, of course, are focusing first and foremost now on the transition into Danaher and are helping the team with their number 1 priority which are to take care of the expansion that they are finalizing as we speak. And we're already in the process of the next set of those expansions. And so in terms of timeline, we'll talk about that when that becomes something that's on the top of the agenda. But currently it's all about ensuring an effective transition, taking care of our customers, transitioning the team on to DBS and they're incredibly excited about that. And of course, subsequent expansions as we go forward.
Matt Sykes: Great, thanks and just maybe just one follow-up. You're obviously generating impressive amount of free cash flow and even very active in M&A, but what are your thoughts in terms of inorganic investments as you move forward, looking at where you are in terms of leverage and what you want to accomplish?
Rainer Blair: We really like the way we're positioned. Both in terms of the franchises and the platforms that we have as well as how we're thinking about our earnings Flywheel. I talked about that earlier in the call. Driving that mid-single-digit plus growth, the double-digit EPS expansion, and of course then having a very strong balance sheet position in order to continue to prioritize capital allocation towards M&A. And as we think about our balance sheet position this year, after the Aldevron deal, by the end of the year, we should probably be back to about 2 times net debt -- 2 turns of EBITDA over net debt. And we think that puts us in great position and our funnels are active. And we continue to work as we always have at Danaher to ensure that we have the next deal ahead of us and take advantage of the balance sheet that we have. We're very well positioned there. We feel good about where we sit.
Matt Sykes: Great. Thanks very much.
Rainer Blair : Thank you.
Operator: We will take our final question from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Rainer Blair : Good morning, Luke.
Luke Sergott: Morning, how are you? Thanks for squeezing me in. So just quickly on the backlog, and you think you're raising your guidance there or your expectations of what you're expecting in 20 -- to exit the year. Can you give us a sense of the mix between the vaccine and the therapeutic revenue, or how that order book is shaping up?
Rainer Blair : Sure. Sure. So rough numbers here, Luke, thinking about 85% vaccine, 15% therapeutics. That's roughly -- those are the rough numbers there.
Luke Sergott: Okay, that's helpful. And then, we were expecting a little more balance between the 4-in-1 and the just pure COVID tests. Can you give us a sense of the order there, the -- how the orders are starting to shape up ahead of the flu season? It makes sense that we haven't had flu season yet, but -- and then really how -- trying to figure out how to think about the first half of '21 through that winter season.
Rainer Blair : In terms of the mix here in Q3, we saw 80% COVID only 20% 4-in-1 test. And as you think about Q4 here, we see that heading towards the 50-50. A good way to think about it as 50% of the COVID -only test in Q4 and 50% of the 4-in-1. Now as we think about the first half of next year, I think the best way to think about it right now is the 45 million tests that we've been talking about. And generally speaking, the same kind of mix ratios that we have within flu seasons and outside of flu season. So within flu season, probably around 50/50 is the best way to think about it: 4-in-1 and COVID only. And then if we're outside of the flu season, probably closer to 80-20.
Luke Sergott: Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Rainer Blair : Got it. Thank you.
Operator: I will now turn the program back over to Matt Gugino.
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Emma. Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we are around all day to get your questions.
Rainer Blair : Thank you, everybody.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Crystaal and I'll be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.
Matthew Gugino: Thanks, Crystaal. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 5, 2021. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.  Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the second quarter of 2021, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we're presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth includes Cytiva sales in the calculation of period-to-period sales growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We're very pleased with our strong start to the year with another terrific results in the second quarter.  We saw broad-based strength across the portfolio, which helped us deliver over 30% core revenue growth, more than 70% adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation. This well rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business Systems every day.  During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through significant high impact organic growth investments and enhanced our portfolio with strategic growth accelerating acquisitions.  We prioritized innovation across Danaher and increased our production capabilities, all of which we believe contributed to the market share gains in several of our businesses.  We also announced our pending acquisition about Aldevron, which will expand our presence into the fast growing and important frontier of genomic medicine.  Putting it all together, we believe the combination of our leading portfolio and DBS driven execution differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance.  So, with that, let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion and we delivered core revenue growth of 31.5%, with strong contributions from all three of our reporting segments.  Geographically, high growth markets grew nearly 35% and developed markets were up more than 25%. Revenue in each of our three largest markets, North America, Western Europe, and China, was up 30% or more in the quarter.  Our gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix and the impact of prior-year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Our operating profit margin increased to 27.8%, including 775 basis points of core operating margin expansion, primarily as a result of higher gross margin and continued lower operating expense as travel and other related costs remained below pre-pandemic levels.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.46 were up to 71% compared to 2020. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up over 40% year-over-year.  In June, we announced our intention to acquire Aldevron, a producer of high quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and protein, serving academic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers. The addition of Aldevron will expand our capabilities into the important field of genomic medicine, where we're seeing the accelerated adoption of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing technology.  We anticipate Aldevron will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels as we expect the business to generate $500 million of revenue in 2022, with more than 20% annual revenue growth and a strong margin profile. We look forward to welcoming this incredibly talented and innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes.  In addition to announcing Aldevron acquisition, we also accelerated several organic growth investments across the portfolio. One of our core values at Danaher is innovation defines our future. And we have made a significant commitment toward our research and development efforts, increasing our research and development spend by more than 30% year-over-year to bring more impactful solutions to our customers.  At SCIEX, we launched the ZenoTOF 7600, a high resolution accurate mass spectrometry system that enables scientists to identify, characterize and quantify molecules at previously undetectable level, helping to advance the development of new biotherapeutics and precision diagnostics.  At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, we recently introduced the DxA 5000 Fit, a compact automation solution designed for small and mid-sized laboratories that reduces up to 80% of the manual steps typically required for sample preparation.  These are just a few great examples of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher to support our customers and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation.  Additionally, we're making substantial investments to expand capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and Cepheid. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand, driven by both the market and meaningful share gains. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see tremendous runway ahead, given the underlying structural growth drivers in the market they serve.  We expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. We believe the strategic combination of these organic and inorganic investments across our portfolio will reinforce our competitive advantage and accelerate our growth trajectory going forward.  Now, let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segments. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 41.5%, with core revenue up 35%. This growth was broad based, with most of our major businesses in the platform delivering 30% or better core growth. We continue to see strong demand for our bioprocessing solutions with combined core revenue growth of more than 40% with Cytiva and Pall Biotech.  Our non-COVID related bioprocessing business was up low double digit, where we saw robust customer activity and order rates. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenues were consistent with the first quarter and exceeded $1 billion over the first six months of the year.  So, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to reflect on Cytiva's fantastic first year as part of Danaher. We've established a new company with a new brand name, added more than 1,500 associates and made substantial progress in the transition to Danaher, all while maintaining world class support of our customers, significantly ramping production capacity and growing revenue by more than 50%.  When we announced the acquisition, we talked about the strategic and value creation opportunities we saw, and we're excited to welcome such a talented and engaged team to Danaher. I think it's fair to say they've exceeded our expectations in every way. And that's really a testament to the Cytiva team who've embraced Danaher and the Danaher Business System and continued to execute exceptionally in support of our customers.  Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 40.5% and core revenue grew 37%, led by more than 50% core growth at Cepheid. Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems each grew more than 30% as patient volume and clinical diagnostic activity approached pre-pandemic levels around the world.  At Cepheid, growth outside of respiratory testing was led by our sexual health and hospital acquired infection assays, particularly among newly acquired Cepheid customers. In respiratory testing, we believe we continued to gain market share as expanded manufacturing capacity enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 14 million cartridges in the quarter.  As expected, COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of these shipments, while our four-in-one combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 20%. This broad-based performance across Cepheid was driven by the team's thoughtful installed base expansion over the last 15 months and is evidence of the significant value Cepheid provides to clinicians with unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results, and the best-in-class, easy-to-use workflow at the point of care.  Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 15.5% and core revenue was up 13%. Revenue growth accelerated across both platforms with water quality up high single-digit and product identification up approximately 20% in the quarter.  In our water quality businesses, demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by improving activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end markets. Equipment order rates accelerated as customers got back up and running and began to invest in larger projects.  In product identification, Videojet was up mid-teens and our packaging and color management businesses were up more than 25% in the quarter. This acceleration reflected a broad-based recovery with growth across most major geographies and end markets.  So, with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through trends geographically and across our end markets. Looking at conditions around the world, most major regions and countries have broadly returned to or are approaching normal operations. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the US, Europe and China.  That said, we're mindful of the emerging COVID-19 variants driving further outbreaks, and have taken action to help minimize the potential impact on our respective businesses. And at this point, we've seen no material impact from recent variants or selective lockdowns. We saw positive momentum across our businesses with order growth trending above revenue growth. Most of our end markets have largely recovered, with growth rates at or above pre-pandemic levels as customers have adapted to the new environment.  In-person commercial activity continues to rebound, and we're seeing our teams spend more time on site with their customers, a trend we expect to continue as we move through the year.  Across Life Sciences, we're seeing healthy demand in most of our end markets, led by biopharma where the pace of customer activity remains elevated. Biotech funding levels are robust and the number of lifesaving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise, and it's further augmented by the work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.  Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is more than 50% increase from just five years ago. We also see over 1,000 gene therapy candidates in development today, a tenfold increase over the last several years as these technologies mature and therapies gain regulatory approval. Given that many of these candidates are still in early stage research, we expect the growth rate of this market to remain strong for many years to come.  In addition to the growth in biologics and genomic-based medicines, there is significant demand related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, both on the market and in development today. Given the interest we're seeing from customers looking to address emerging variants and increased global supply, as well as evolving vaccination guidelines globally, we expect to see durable growth in this segment of the biopharma market for the foreseeable future.  At the current pace of vaccination, it's clear that vaccine demand will continue well into next year. We expect to recognize $2 billion in COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021 and anticipate entering 2022 with approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-related backlog. These assumptions do not include the potential contribution from booster shots or an expansion of availability to populations under 12 year old due to the level of uncertainty around each of these scenarios.  Given the growing numbers of drugs being developed and the increasing scientific sophistication required to discover and manufacture these complex therapies, customers are looking to partner with vendors who can reliably supply them with solutions for their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale.  Our comprehensive bioprocessing portfolio and scientific expertise positions us well to do just that. And we're confident our proactive investments in innovation and capacity will help us meet this growing customer demand now and far into the future.  In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness check, routine screening and other elective procedures.  In molecular diagnostics, while PCR respiratory testing volumes in the US have declined, we're seeing persistent demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care. Outside of the US, which makes up approximately half of Cepheid's revenue, we continue to see strong demand for our testing as vaccination rates lag and emerging variants drive outbreaks.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 14 million respiratory tests during the second quarter, up from 10 million shipped in the first quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 50 million tests in 2021.  Looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point of care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. And given Cepheid's leading positioning around speed, accuracy, and the ease of use workflow advantages, we believe we'll continue to gain market share.  The combination of these market share gains, the expansion of Cepheid's leading global installed base and the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market creates significant opportunities ahead for broader utilization and demand for Cepheid point-of-care molecular testing solution. Moving to the applied markets, we're seeing a continuation of the steady improvement over the first half of the year. Customer activity is accelerating in line with broader economic activity, which we see in healthy order rates for consumables and increasing investment in equipment.  Across municipal markets globally, consumable demand remains solid as customers continue to test and treat water and instrument-oriented project activity is accelerating with the improving funding environment.  Now, let's look ahead to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver third quarter core revenue growth in the mid to high-teens range. We anticipate high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the third quarter and for the remainder of 2021.  For the full-year 2021, we now expect to deliver approximately 20% core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwind will be an approximately 10% contribution to the core revenue growth rate. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up 10% for the full year, an increase from our prior expectation of high single-digits.  So, to wrap up, we've had a great start to the year and we've seen meaningful opportunities across Danaher to build upon this outstanding performance. Our second quarter results reiterate the power of our portfolio and our exceptional team, a unique combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance. With that, back to you, Matt. 
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Crystaal, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Congrats on the quarter. Rainer, I think one of the debates around the stock is still around the testing outlook, in particular around 2022 for Cepheid. I know you came out in the first quarter and talked about the fact you thought trends would be sustainable heading into next year. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the field, how you're thinking about variants in the near term and what gives you confidence in the outlook for 2022? Obviously, you're more hospital with PCR, not antigen. So, we get all those dynamics. But I think there's still some debate as to whether testing could drop off more significantly next year.
Rainer Blair: As we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 15 million tests in 2021 for COVID, either COVID only or four-in-one. And we've taken that up from the 45 million test guide before. And the confidence that we gain here is really through what we've seen. As we've ramped up our capacity here and shipped 14 million cartridges in Q2, you'll recall we originally expected to ship 11 million in Q2. 50% of that outside of the US, 50% of that inside the US. That really has given us the confidence that there's still plenty of demand for our solution at the point of care.  And here's why? We're really not perceiving a slowdown currently in our testing demand, and we're shipping everything that we're producing. So, while it's true that we see core lab tests trending downwards, we continue to see strength in the demand for our testing solution.  The other thing that we are considering here is we're a bit concerned about some of the RSV breakouts that we're seeing in the US, but also elsewhere in the world, which makes us think that we'll start seeing testing skew more towards the four-in-one solution which, of course, tests for RSV in addition of Flu A, B And COVID-19.  So, as we think about where we sit today, we feel comfortable that we'll see 50 million tests this year, and we don't have anything that would indicate that our previous guide for 45 million tests in 2022 would be materially different. We continue to see plenty of opportunity. Keep in mind, we've increased our installed base by 40% since the beginning of the pandemic, and of course, have the largest testing menu with 30 plus tests outside the US and 20 plus tests in the US. So, we feel we feel strongly that that demand should be available to us once again because of that unique value proposition at the point of care.
Tycho Peterson: A follow-up on Aldevron. I think you mentioned when we spoke on the deal that you've been looking at this asset for about five years. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about synergies? I know there's capacity expansion that's coming online next year. So, if you could talk to that. And then, I think to get to half a point of growth, the implied growth rate is closer to 35%. Definitely greater than 20%. But I'm just curious how you're thinking about growth outlook and synergies with Pall and Cytiva, in particular.
Rainer Blair: As we look at Aldevron, we really see it as our entry into the genomic medicine market, and are seeing it really as a standalone in that regard, specifically with plasmid DNA, protein and mRNA, and are really not looking initially here at synergies related to Cytiva or Pall. There's plenty of opportunity inside that scope to invest, expand capacity in the existing product lineup, as well as to globalize that. The great majority of Aldevron's revenues are actually in the US. So, we see great opportunities to globalize that.  And from a growth perspective, like we said, this is in 2022 going to be $0.5 billion business growing at 20%, adding about 50 basis points to Danaher's overall growth profile, as well as adding $0.20 of EPS in year one and $0.30 EPS in year two.
Matt McGrew: Tycho, they have a little bit better growth historically than kind of that 20%. But I think, again, just sort of from our perspective, to be prudent from a planning perspective, that's sort of what we've laid out. I think we've had a lot of success with that type of setting up, if you will, for acquisitions in the past. That's sort of why we've kind of come to there versus where they have been a little bit more historically higher.
Tycho Peterson: Matt, can you just comment on the bioprocessing order book? I think you said bioprocessing up 40%. I assume that was revenues. What was the order book up?
Matt McGrew: It was north of 60%. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Hey, this is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. A couple quick ones. Just to clarify, on the COVID contribution for the fiscal year, it sounds like you're saying 10%, which is roughly unchanged from prior, but you're seeing a lot more cartridges coming out. The four-in-one solution should have some better pricing if you're going with that versus the COVID-only. And the COVID vax is doing better and the order book is strong. So, are there some other moving pieces there? Or is this just some uncertainty back half of the year? Just want to reconcile that.
Matt McGrew: I think the way to think about the COVID tailwind is we sort of took up the number for the full year, Mike. And I think what I would kind of think about that is that most of that is the $200 million better cartridge performance that we saw here in Q2 sort of rolling through for the full year. So, if you think about the COVID contributions, I think we're up $200 million versus where we thought we would be. All of that is just going to be sort of rolling that Q2 beat through to the full year for the COVID. side.  As far as the four-in-one goes, as we think about the contribution kind of going forward, we still think Q3 is probably going to be pretty close to what we saw here in Q2, which was – 80% of that was COVID only, 20% was the four-in-one.  Given what Rainer said and what we saw last year as well, but what Rainer said around the RSV sort of outbreak here that we're seeing in the south, we think we might have a little bit of a different or more of a respiratory season than we did last year. So, sort of as we move forward, we're sort of thinking, Q4, that split moves more to kind of a 50/50, 60/40. We'll see where it comes out, but something more like that in the fourth quarter. 
Michael Ryskin: Could you comment a little bit on instrument trends in some of the analytical markets? I didn't get a clean SCIEX number. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in LCMS markets as far as base business recovery? 
Rainer Blair: If we start with the topic of customer activity in these analytical markets, they're really at or very near pre-pandemic levels with the underlying recovery well underway. And we're seeing the customers adapting readily to new work environments that we're in there where it's still necessary or are fully back to normal where the infection rates are really low. So, that manifests itself in better order rates, our funnels are stronger, we see higher instrument and service sales. Keep in mind, SCIEX over 30% core growth here in Q2, just as a marker. But really, all of our major life science operating companies were at or over 30% core growth for the quarter. So, we're seeing some very nice momentum there.  And if you look at the two-year growth stack there, we're really at or very near to pre-pandemic growth rate. While this is driven by more customer activity, but we also have to say, in our instrument areas is a place where we have been accelerating R&D investment and we've seen great traction for some of our new product introductions. I mentioned the SCIEX ZenoTOF, but we've also introduced the 7500. And at Beckman Life Sciences, we introduced the CytoFLEX cell sorter. So, those are all things that contribute to what we think is outperformance here in the instrumentation market.
Matt McGrew: Mike, just to give you a sense, outside of life sciences, just overall, equipment was up north of 20% and consumables were north of 30%. So, just to give you a sense of – that's not all that different from what we saw elsewhere as well.
Michael Ryskin: One last quick one if I can squeeze it in. I think you called out CapEx of $1.5 billion for the year. That's a pretty nice step up even with Cytiva in the numbers. Just wondering how much of that is specific to more cartridges for Cepheid, for COVID or more on the bioprocessing side? And is this a fair jumping off point for 2022 and beyond? 
Rainer Blair: I think, Mike, normally even inclusive of Cepheid or Cytiva, we'd probably be more like $850 million in CapEx. So, I think you can kind of size the delta on that $1.5 billion with that. I would say that the preponderance of the increase that you're seeing there is going to be at Cepheid and Cytiva as at Pall on the bioprocessing side. So, those would be the three big ones that will be sort of driving that increase.  I suspect – you'll see that, obviously, this year. I suspect we might be at something in between those two numbers. Maybe we're at the higher end of that number, the $850 million and the $1.5 billion as we head into next year. But I think, over time, that probably does start to come down a touch. As we've talked about, we've been pulling forward a lot of the capacity increases that we were already planning for all of those businesses, just given the demand now, plus the longer-term secular growth drivers.  This is sort of more of a pull forward is the way I think about it, and I think you'll have a little bit of a bolus [ph] here for a couple years and then probably come back down to a lower landing level. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. 
Vijay Kumar: Congratulations on a solid print this morning. Maybe one on vaccines and bioprocessing, Rainer. The commentary around backlog, exit backlogs stepping up for the year in light of 2Q, it feels like maybe the order conversion, maybe that's stepping down in back half. And is that the right way? This is just more of a timing thing that we're thinking about on the vaccine side when you think about the revenue cadence? And then, ex vaccines, when you think about pace, bioprocessing, we just had a major Alzheimer's drug approval. I'm curious what it does to either industry growth or perhaps at your business.
Rainer Blair: Let's start with bioprocess and how to think about that. So, just to level-set, we expect to do for vaccines and therapeutics this year $2 billion in revenue, and that second half is going to be consistent with what you saw in the first half. And so, the activity level remains elevated. And any decel that you're thinking about is purely related to comps. And now more broadly speaking, speaking really for total Danaher, the Q2, Q3 prior year step up is over 1,000 basis points. Right? So, if you keep that in mind, I think that characterizes the activity level appropriately. We continue to see strength in vaccine and therapeutic. Orders, Matt has talked about it with Tycho, 40% plus on the revenue side in Q2, 60% plus on the order side. So, the activity level remains very high. And we expect that this will continue, which is why we're confident in talking about $1.5 billion of backlog for 2022, which sitting here on July 20 looking forward is a good place for us to be. And it gives us, as you think about 2022, a number of quarters to continue to strengthen that. So, there's a great deal going on in the vaccine and therapeutic space. Keep in mind, the rollout that we've seen has been primarily a developed market story. We're starting now to see some of the emerging market vaccine manufacturers kicking in and ramping up. There's three in China to say an example. Another one in Russia, of course, and several more. And they're just starting to kick in. So, we expect that all to provide really some sustained strength for some period of time. 
Matt McGrew: Vijay, maybe just a 100,000 foot view, just to kind of think about – in each of the last five quarters in biotech, the bookings have been higher than revenue. And that was also true in Q2, just to kind of – there's all kinds of numbers and comps and everything else, just take a step back and just kind of keep that in mind as we head into the second half here. 
Rainer Blair: Now coming back to your Alzheimer drug question with Aduhelm, first of all, we can't comment specifically on any particular drug. But we're absolutely delighted to see that science and the pharmaceutical industry is making progress on this disease. Alzheimer's, as you know, afflicts so many around the world and there's a real need for a solution. At this point, it's early days. As you know, there's quite a bit of discussion around the efficacy of the drug, the size of the target population, reimbursement, and a number of other questions.  But I might say that this is one drug. There are several others that are in late stage qualification and approval processes. And so, we do see here this indication of Alzheimer's disease becoming more and more relevant for monoclonal antibodies.  Awfully early to say what impact it has, but we can say that with the breadth of our portfolio, the capability of our team and the penetration that we have in the market, it's fair to say that we're represented on all of those projects and are confident that we can supply those, should there be an elevated need.
Vijay Kumar: Matt, one quick one for you. Appreciate you're trying to simplify the numbers. A lot of numbers flying around. With orders above revenue for five quarters, I think that's straightforward. Assuming mix is – ignoring the mix impact for 2022, any comments on margins or incremental margin for fiscal 2022 as expenses come back?
Matt McGrew: Vijay, I'd love to have the crystal ball for 2022 for you, but I'm just still hoping to get some insight into the second half, frankly. Like you said, besides the mix, we are starting to – as we got into the quarter and we had pretty good fall through here in the quarter again, but we are starting to see activity resume a little bit, especially late in the quarter. A little bit more travel activity, a little bit more kind of people doing in-person things. And so, I think, in my mind, there's two things. It's when do the costs come back because I do believe we will have some costs come back, and how fast that happens. So, it's just really kind of balancing those two. And I think there's still enough uncertainty out there that it's difficult to pin that down. I'm hoping that as we get into the fall here that we get a bit more color on that, and hopefully be able to provide a little bit more when we talk about 2022 later in the year. But unfortunately, I think it's a little early for us to think about it. But that's where we are today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: I was really surprised. I thought you might mention labor and logistics costs and some challenges there, particularly in E&AS. Is there a meaningful impact on margins, more broad based in E&AS, if so? I'd just leave it there.
Matt McGrew: It's a fair point. We have definitely seen it. I think, again, similar to the travel sort of as we've moved through the quarter, I think we are definitely seeing inflationary pressures here and supply chain pressures. I would say that, right now, for us, it is modest. And we're able to manage through it, some of that with better price on our side and some of it just being able to on the daily work, if you will, from a DBS perspective, but we are definitely seeing that. We are seeing it in resins, in plastics, in metals. Again, not a huge part for us, but we do see it where that happens. I think the two biggest pieces for us, Scott, our freight is definitely an issue. Fewer cargo flights obviously means it's a little bit more expensive to move things by air. And then, I think as everybody has read and saw, electronics, particularly the supply chain around the chips globally, has been a challenge for us as well.  So, again, haven't seen material impact. I do believe that as we move forward into the second half that that probably does not abate, if anything might step up a little bit and clearly a challenge here for us. But so far, we've been able to work through it with some hard work and a little bit of price and some PPV.
Scott Davis: Just to follow-up on that, Matt. Does times like this really make looking at things like on-time delivery kind of wonky and hard to even think? Can you still use that metric with any real sense of confidence since orders are so high?
Rainer Blair: We don't compromise on that. The core value, customers talk, we listen. And our focus on quality, delivery, and cost remains our Northstar. And we drive our processes. And with that, anybody who's associated with that, starting with what we can control internally, but also our supply partners who have been stepping up to the plate supporting us here and making the necessary investments. But we're not going to compromise on on-time delivery and meeting or exceeding our customer's expectation.
Scott Davis: Well, congrats, guys. And congrats on a great start, Rainer, in your CEO tenure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: I want to go back and try to kind of take a different angle on some of the questions regarding durability of growth when it comes to all things post-COVID. So, on Cepheid, there was an earlier question on the outlook for testing volume in 2022. You've noted before, your GeneXpert install base increased by about 40% since the beginning of the pandemic. You've also previously talked about your efforts to be as smart as you can about where you place boxes. Essentially, the goal has been to as much as possible pull forward placements, especially in areas of the world where you may have been under indexed in an effort to make sure that these instruments are used durably over the long term. I was wondering if you could share some specific data on how you're having success with newer accounts driving utilization of these boxes for non-COVID-19 purposes? And additionally, is it possible that there are some new assays coming over the coming quarters that might move you into additional testing categories that also boost your confidence in the outlook for durability? I ask because right before the pandemic got going, we had picked up on some signs that there were some notable advancements being made on assay development initiatives, including some of those talked about in the past by old Cepheid management, which would greatly increase the TAM for the company. I think a lot of lingering concerns about this category would be further assuaged by combining what we saw in Q2, which was really strong with the outlook for assay menu expansion and some positive signs in terms of what's going on with newer accounts.
Rainer Blair: I think you're on to a strong point here, which is – and we saw this in Q2, but just to level-set for everybody here on the phone. Once again, we've increased our installed base here since the beginning of the pandemic by 40% plus, and that's with thousands of instruments in places where they haven't been before. And we've tried to do that very strategically, always, of course, wanting to help with the COVID pandemic and the near-term requirements and needs, but also looking beyond that to see whether those care settings would be able to use the menu that we have available today and the one that, of course, we develop every day in order to launch new assays. And we have seen that starting to play out in places where perhaps the COVID need is not as strong and particularly at new customers. And that's manifested, for instance, in our sexual health or hospital acquired infections assays, which are up 30% plus, here in the second quarter, and provide us with an additional pillar of strength. And so, we're very pleased with that. And we expect that to continue here as we not only made progress in the US, but in the rest of the world. So, very important point. The menu is gaining traction, and we're starting to see that play out here in the second quarter and expect that to continue to be the case going forward.  Now, as it relates to new assays, please know that we are working on new assays every day. And you can expect that, over time, to continue to broaden that lead in menu breadth, as well as depth over time. So, that's absolutely a part of our daily activity here.
Doug Schenkel: Hopping over to really the Pall and the Cytiva side of the equation, as we've talked about it a few times, the expected backlog heading into 2022 is $1.5 billion. The potential for upside, I think, seems pretty clear specific to COVID. That said, there is still some investor uncertainty with regards to what happens if demand were to slow in this category. A basic but important question is if demand were to slow for COVID related products and services in this category, is it fair to say that you're comfortable that there was enough demand more broadly across biopharma to essentially compensate for that? Our thinking has been, this has been an area where there just hasn't been enough good supply of products and services, and that's presented you with a fantastic opportunity to basically solve that problem. Even if the COVID demand were to slow, presumably, you're still going to be able to essentially reallocate these products and services for other purposes. Is that a fair way of thinking about things?
Rainer Blair: I think so. And before we move on to the non-COVID strength out there, let's reiterate in relation to that backlog number that we talked about what assumptions are in that and which assumptions are not in that number. So, in that $1.5 billion backlog, that's in addition to the $2 billion that we're shipping this year, that includes all the approved vaccines, whether those are approved in the US and Europe or elsewhere, as well as those in late stage trials, which you can imagine we're very close to. So, that's absolutely a part of how we're thinking about that. And it includes these emerging market vaccines that I was talking about. But what it doesn't include is the booster shot. And we know from Israel, we know from the UK, we know from China that those countries are now moving to booster shots, but we have not assumed that to be a part of our numbers here, nor have we included the younger kids, 12 and under, in a vaccination schedule, which you can imagine on a worldwide basis is a pretty big number. So, we've kept that out. And we think that that's an appropriate assumption.  Now as we look to the non-COVID demand, which has consistently been in the low double digits here, with one or the other quarter perhaps even above, we feel very confident that the number of projects in the pipeline, we talked about it, over 1,500 monoclonal antibodies in the development pipeline, over 50% more than just five years ago. And then you add, related to that, the gene and cell therapies and genomic medicines where you have over 1,000 projects in the pipeline, which is an order of magnitude more than just five years ago, we feel quite strongly that the capacity utilization will remain very robust here for the mid and long term.
Operator: And your last question will come from the line of Daniel Leonard with Wells Fargo.
Daniel Leonard: Two, if I may. The first one on bioprocessing. We're still hearing about supply shortages in the market for filters and such. When do you think we're going to see more of an equilibrium, when supply catches up with demand? Is there any change in your thinking on customer inventory dynamics around stocking and such? 
Rainer Blair: Let me start with this. I think that, in general, there is a strong supply of filters, as you mentioned, perhaps single use products and such in the market and that there might be pockets where there's some shortages, but I think I would prescribe those to individual type product shortages as opposed to a broad-based shortage as the industry and, particularly, Danaher has continued to ramp capacities with some of the investments that we made. So, I think that what the industry has been able to do is accompany the growth here and continue to support that.  Now, as it relates to your inventory question, here we have been very, very rigorous in our interactions with our customers who we've asked and encouraged to give us their orders as early as possible to give us the visibility that we need to ensure that they get what they need. And as such, we don't believe that there's pockets of inventory that are sitting here in the industry. You can never ignore that there might be one or two places that perhaps that might be the case, but it's really not material in the overall size of the industry. So, we think that the industry is tight on supply. Everybody is working through it with each other, we with our customers with a great deal of visibility, but of course also with our suppliers who we mentioned earlier, who have also had to ramp up to support us and the value chain. 
Daniel Leonard: My follow-up question is similar to Vijay's earlier on the margin side. Could you perhaps maybe bridge the expense base today when you have these COVID sales tailwinds to a world where those tailwinds might abate? Are there any expenses that that go away? Or just maybe the rate of expense increase starts to moderate? 
Matt McGrew: I think maybe the way to answer that is, today, we've been sort of seeing in the last, I guess, five quarters, our VCM has been kind of 50%. And as I look forward and think about the expenses coming back, and it's not just COVID, I would say it's kind of broadly speaking across the business, we think it's going to start to ramp here in the second half and be in the sort of 40% fall through. Dan, if you think about where we've been more historically, it's probably been more like 35%. And so, I think what we'll see is that the expenses – and here again, the uncertainty in the timing is what I'm still not sure on, but I think what we'll see is that that expense base will come back a little bit more closer to that normal, longer-term 35%. And part of that is not only are we – we're sort of seeing the benefits, I think, of the investments that we continue to make and we have been making in innovation and kind of go-to-market.  And I think with that, if you think about today, our base business on a two-year stack for this year is going to be 6% to 7% core growth, which is 100 basis points plus where we were in 2019. And so, I think the investments that we're making are paying off on the growth side. And I think both Rainer and myself are inclined to want to kind of keep making those investments, while recognizing that we're going to have some costs that come back as we get back to the office and we start to travel again.  So, maybe, Dan, the way to bridge it would be 50% today, I think, probably is a little bit more like 40% in the second half, and over time, I think it probably is something more like 35% if I had to guess. 
Operator: We have reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gugino for closing remarks.
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Crystaal. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. And we're around all day for questions. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Lori, and I'll be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Lori. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 6, 2021. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the first quarter of 2021, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we're presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth includes Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth comparing the current period Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to acquisition. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of 2021, we got off to a very strong start, delivering better-than-expected core revenue growth across our portfolio. Our broad-based performance was driven by double-digit core revenue growth in our base business, our ongoing contributions to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and strong demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests. Our record top line performance also contributed to outstanding earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. Our well-rounded first quarter results are a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our commitment to continuous improvement. We have an exceptional collection of market-leading franchises and technologies all powered by the Danaher Business System, that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. We generated $6.9 billion of sales in the first quarter with 30% core revenue growth. All three of our reporting segments delivered better-than-expected growth, led by Life Sciences and Diagnostics. We believe we continue to capture market share, particularly at some of our larger businesses, including Cytiva, Pall, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Hach and Videojet. Over the last several years, we've prioritized high impact growth investments in innovation, sales and marketing, to ensure that we're well positioned both near and long term. Through new product introductions and the impact of our Danaher Business System growth tools, we've enhanced our competitive advantage and believe we've achieved notable market share gain. Geographically, revenue growth was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets. We saw over 20% growth in the developed market, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up more than 45%, largely driven by the recovery in China. Our gross profit margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 62% in the first quarter, largely due to higher sales volumes and the positive impact of higher-margin product mix. Our operating profit margin of 29.1% was up 1300 basis points year-over-year, including more than 900 basis points of core margin expansion as a result of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses, as we continue to see limited travel and other related costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.52 were up 140% versus last year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 135% year-over-year. Now in the first quarter, we deployed more than $400 million of capital towards mergers and acquisitions across all three segments. Most notably, IDT and Cytiva completed their first bolt-on acquisition with IDT adding Swift Biosciences, which brings complementary capabilities and a broad portfolio of next-gen sequencing library preparation and enrichment solutions for DNA, RNA and methylated DNA samples. And Cytiva acquired Vanrx Pharmasystems, which provides innovative, automated aseptic tolling technologies used to fill vials, syringes and cartridges, a critical final step to complete the bioprocessing workflow. We also continued to make significant organic investments and high-impact growth initiatives across all of Danaher. Over the past six months, we've invested in a meaningful expansion of production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences. Near term, these investments will support COVID-related demand, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses, where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying growth drivers and the durability of the markets they serve. Between these four businesses, we're investing more than $1 billion in 2021 to continue to meet our customer’s needs today and well into the future. So now let's take a look - a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 115% as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, and core revenue was up 41.5%. We saw strong double-digit core revenue growth across all of our largest operating companies in the platform, led by Cytiva, Pall Life Sciences, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. In our bioprocessing businesses, accelerating demand for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and production drove a combined core revenue growth rate of more than 60% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Excluding the impact of COVID-related activity, our underlying biopharma business grew in the low 20s range. We believe that our ability to continue meeting customer’s needs across their bioprocessing workflows enabled us to gain market share in the quarter, particularly within our cell culture media and single-use product line. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 34%, and core revenue grew 31%. Each of our largest operating companies in the platform achieved high single digit or better core revenue growth, led by Cepheid, which achieved more than 90% core revenue growth. In response to the unprecedented demand for Cepheid's rapid point-of-care molecular test, the team again increased production capacity and shipped over 10 million respiratory test cartridges in the first quarter. Roughly half of the tests shipped were COVID-only tests, and the other half were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV. We also saw increasing demand for non-respiratory tests across Cepheid's market-leading test menu, including sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and urology, demonstrating the broad applicability of Cepheid's molecular diagnostic offering. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 3.5%. Our Water Quality platform was up slightly and product identification was up high single digits. Our Water Quality businesses support customer’s day-to-day mission-critical water operations, providing water testing, treatment and analysis across a variety of applications around the world. We saw good underlying demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables during the quarter, and we're encouraged by the improvement in equipment sales, which returned to growth as customers got back up and running at more normalized levels. In Product Identification, we saw mid single digit core revenue growth in our marking and coding businesses and double-digit growth in packaging and color management. Esko and X-Rite benefited from the underlying market recovery and saw good momentum from customers initiating new projects and investments in the first quarter. So with that context from what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look - walk through some of the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies. Customer activity around the world is approaching pre-pandemic levels as we all collectively adapt to working in this new environment. We're seeing this in the form of strong sales funnels and order book growth. Service levels at or near pre-pandemic levels and an uptick in equipment revenues. While some of this dynamic is a result of pent-up demand in the wake of widespread lockdowns, we're starting to see underlying recovery across most of our end markets that were impacted. Now if we take a closer look at these dynamics by geography, China appears to be the furthest along in terms of reopening, with activity levels largely back to normal. The US is not all the way back just yet, but is moving in the right direction. And an increase in vaccination rates across the country appear to be driving some of this progress. Europe is improving broadly. And while certain areas have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, we've not seen any material impact. In Life Sciences, activity in the broader biopharma market remains robust. There has not been any slowdown in the double-digit growth trend we've seen over the last several quarters across non-COVID-related biopharma activity. Within COVID-related biopharma activity, the significant ramp-up of vaccines and therapeutics is driving record bioprocessing demand. We're involved in the majority of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway around the world today, including all of those in the US that are currently on the market or in later-stage clinical trials. Our operating companies are playing a significant role in the development and production of new therapies and vaccines across the biopharma pipeline. And given the breadth of our offering and the production capacity we're adding in 2021, we're uniquely positioned to support our customers in their mission today and well into the future, which is to make more life-saving treatment available to more patients faster. In clinical diagnostics, we continue to see heightened demand for rapid point-of-care molecular testing. As we look across the COVID-19 testing landscape and consider the durability of the demand that we're seeing, we believe that Cepheid's positioning is the strongest amongst the various testing modalities and settings. Cepheid's leading presence at the point of care, combined with the speed, accuracy and workflow advantages of their molecular offering, uniquely positions the business to support customer’s testing needs, not only for COVID-19, but beyond the pandemic as well. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major geographies as elective procedures and hospital visits have rebounded from last year. Consumables growth is accelerating as a result, and we're encouraged by the momentum of instrument placement. Finally, in the applied market, consumables remain solid across essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And growth is picking up on the equipment side as customers get back to more normal operations and initiate capital investments. Now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver second quarter core revenue growth in the mid-20s range. We anticipate low double-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a low double-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to have operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver high teens core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be a high single-digit to low double-digit contribution to the core revenue growth rate. This would include an estimated $2 billion of 2021 revenue at Cytiva and Pall Biotech associated with vaccines and therapeutics, which is higher than our previous expectation of $1.3 billion. And at Cepheid, we'll continue ramping capacity through the year and now expect to ship approximately 45 million tests in 2021 compared to our prior estimate of 36 million tests. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up high single digits for the full year. So to wrap up, we had a very strong start to the year and feel good about the momentum we're seeing across all of Danaher. Our first quarter results are a testament to the commitment and capability of our team and a durable, balanced positioning of our portfolio. We believe this combination differentiates Danaher and sets us up well to outperform in 2021 and beyond. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we'll strive to keep building an even better, stronger company and to positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways for all of our stakeholders. We see tremendous opportunities ahead to do just that. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Lori, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, good morning.
Rainer Blair: Good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: I'll start with bioprocess. Obviously, very strong numbers there. Did you give the Pall, Cytiva order number? I didn't hear that, if you did. And then as we kind of think about the durability of the trends there, I appreciate your kind of raising guidance here for both the vaccine and the testing tailwinds. But how do you think about kind of the durability? And then also, was there any stockpiling? We've heard from one of your peers about customers building inventory given supply chain concerns? Thanks.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Tycho. So as it relates to orders growth for our vaccines and therapeutics businesses we're talking primarily here, Cepheid and - I'm sorry, Cytiva and Pall Biotech, first quarter orders growth was over 60%, just to give you a sense of the strength of that. And as we look towards the rest of the year here, you heard us talk about the fact that we're confident now that our total business for the vaccine and therapeutics for 2021 will be $2 billion rather than the originally estimated $1.3 billion. So we continue to see that order build here, as noted here in the first quarter, and that's really continuing to drive strength here for the full year. Now as it relates to stockpiling, we occasionally hear about that on certain and limited products. But in general, and certainly, as we run our business, we're in constant communication, both with our customers and our suppliers to ensure that we don't have pockets of inventory, either a finished product or raw materials sitting idly by holding up any manufacturing of vaccine or therapeutics.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on margins. Obviously, good upside here as well. In particular, on the Life Science side, you had 24% last quarter, now you're 33%. Can you maybe just talk to how you think about the durability of that margin improvement?
Rainer Blair: Well, certainly, the volume ramp here has given us a great deal of volume leverage. And we also, of course, see through the increased consumption of our consumables, a skew in the mix towards the positive. So the margins are very strong. And as we look forward and the comps change and we continue to invest in our businesses, as well as we expect some costs to come back as we get to a more normalized travel situation, I would expect those margins to moderate a little bit.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then before I hop off, just one last one on capital deployment. You mentioned the bolt-ons for IDT and Cytiva. Obviously, we're seeing M&A pick up in the space more broadly. Just curious your thoughts on the landscape appetite for something more meaningful?
Rainer Blair: We continue to be excited about our balance sheet and how quickly we've been able to rebuild that. Now having said that, it's just a year ago that we actually closed the Cytiva acquisition, and there's certainly plenty of work to do there. But having said that, our funnels are very active across all four of our platforms, and we think that we have plenty of opportunity ahead of us.
Matt McGrew: Tycho, its Matt. I just want to get - kind of going back to your first question, just to give you some numbers around sort of the order growth. You had asked about sort of, I think, kind of the continuation of it. Maybe the way to think about it, at least how I think about it is in - for Pall and Cytiva in the vaccine and therapeutics, we did, call it, $500 million in Q1. I think that's going to be pretty consistent here, Q2, 3 and 4. So I think we'll probably do $2 billion for the full year in the vaccines and therapeutics, which will be, like I said, pretty consistent. And then I think when you think about maybe sort of the rest of it, the Cepheid part, that's going to ramp up as we go through the year, given the fact that we've talked about we're going to be doing a little bit more kind of volume here than we initially thought. So that's probably another $2 billion revenue. So total revenue, $4 billion for kind of that COVID tailwind. And one piece, the Cepheid piece will ramp up and the other piece, the vaccine and therapeutics, pretty steady through the year.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. Should we assume some of that vaccine work also spills over into 2022? I know it's only the first quarter of '21, but that's the obvious question we're all going to get is what we set up for 2022 looks like?
Rainer Blair: Yeah. So I think the way we're thinking about that is that we continue to build and ramp on orders growth here. And after the $2 billion, again, vaccine and therapeutics, we expect to have $1 billion of backlog vaccine and therapeutics going into 2022. And that's assuming, right now, with the approved vaccines that are in the various jurisdictions, which are eight currently. So that's the assumption there. And that's not assuming any booster shots or vaccinations of kids under 16. So we do expect to see further vaccine and therapeutic production well into 2022.
Matt McGrew: Yes maybe, Tycho, a simple frame on the numbers of that, too, just to kind of give you a sense of it because I know Rainer mentioned it was $1 billion backlog. But the way that I think I'd frame it is, if you think about '20 and '21, we're probably going to see orders of, call it, 3.6, 3.7 billion cumulatively. I think we did $650 million in sales last year. We think we're going to do $2 billion in sales this year. So that $3.6 less, call it, $2.6 billion in sales is why we end up with a backlog at December of this year to take into '22. And like Rainer said, that really sort of doesn't kind of - that's just where we stand today with the assumption, as Rainer mentioned, that we are not really assuming kind of a fall booster/third shot. We're not assuming that vaccines are going to be out there for kids at this point either. So that's really just what's on the market now, the eight that are cleared and the ramp that we're seeing here in the developed markets largely.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. I’ll let others jump in.
Rainer Blair: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, Rainer. Congrats on a pretty solid print this morning. Just to follow up on that last question. I appreciate all the color. So you guys did $650 million of revenues, vaccine and therapeutics in 2020, cumulative of, call it, $2.6, $2.7 in 2020 and '21. And that does not include children or booster. Just assuming booster, I think most people are leaning towards a third shot. Given that we've recognized about $2.7, a booster third shot would imply another $1.3, like half of the $2.7 as potential incremental perhaps in 2022. Would that math make sense? I'm curious.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. I mean Vijay, I think it's a little early to tell. I mean I think you're right in the assumption that most people, I think, are assuming there's a third shot or a booster. But again, I think it's - the timing and the amount and what it looks like is just a little early to tell. So that's why we sort of wanted to kind of give you what we're seeing now, the framework that doesn't really include it because that's still a bit of an unknown, but just so that you know sort of how we're thinking about where we stand here early - still pretty early in '21. But as that plays out maybe in the second half and in '22, kind of give you an update, but that is not inclusive of the numbers that I just laid out for you.
Vijay Kumar: Understood. And then I did have one follow-up on how to frame what the future could look like. And I'm not asking for guidance in fiscal '22. It's more perhaps broad strokes. And I think the debate has been for some of your peers with the exposure to COVID tailwinds. The debate has been whether companies can grow earnings in '22. I think you guys could end up being one of the few companies that can grow earnings off of fiscal '21 levels. I think Rainer, some of your comments on gaining share in biopharma. And you alluded to the fact, Cepheid, really strong demand. It looks like that increased installed base should flow through to other tests in post-pandemic. Am I right in thinking about some of those broad strokes about '22 earnings being above '21?
Rainer Blair: So Vijay, let me lay out how we're thinking about '22 on the back of '21. And as Matt was just saying, it's a little early to get into specific specifics, as you can imagine. 2022 in this dynamic environment is a ways away. But having said that, we feel confident around the durability of our COVID revenues. So let me try and lay this out a little bit. As I mentioned, we think we entered 2022 with $1 billion in vaccine and therapeutic backlog. And the potential upside that we talked about based on the assumptions, not including boosters, not including kids being vaccinated, nor including at this point, other vaccine programs that might be earlier stage in the pipeline. If you think about that in our very, very broad portfolio, both in terms of upstream and downstream solutions, independent of the vaccine or therapeutic modality, we really see that we're very well positioned there. And that $1 billion backlog is sort of the beginning of that story. Now as we think about testing, so diagnostic testing for COVID, COVID is going to be or is already endemic, and we'll be testing at the point of care for a long time. And so while some folks are talking about 2021 being a peak year for testing for the market, we think Cepheid is uniquely positioned. You recall my example of the concentric circles with the highest durability tests being in the center, representing really Cepheid's point-of-care workflow. And as you think about Cepheid expanded installed base, the very strong menu that we have, we believe that we'll do roughly the same number of tests in 2022 as we are doing in 2021. And you'll recall, we just raised that from 36 million to 45 million tests. And then if you think about our base business, here, we really are and continue to be exposed to a number of attractive secular growth drivers. Biologics, more generally in life science research, along with molecular diagnostics and the decentralization of health care. And then, of course, environmental sustainability as you think about our water quality group and packaging needs continue to proliferate. So net-net, we feel we're uniquely positioned to outperform in 2021 and beyond.
Vijay Kumar: Well, that is impressive. Thanks for the comments, guys. Congrats.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to go back to guidance. And I think it's a math question. I'm just wondering if you could help us bridge essentially the delta between your prior core revenue growth guidance for low double digits and the updated range of high-teens growth? More specifically, I'm wondering where you're seeing the most improvement from a business perspective relative to where we were at your last update. And along those lines, what are you now assuming for the core operating environment, particularly as we look ahead to the second half of the year?
Rainer Blair: Sure, Doug. So let's come back to the full year guide going from mid to high teens. And a simple frame if we start at the top there would be that we see the full year base business now at high single-digit core growth and full year COVID tailwinds to be in the high single, low double digits. Now if we start with the base business, we see that sustaining certainly at the current levels with customer activity around the world continuing to resume and approaching pre-pandemic levels. And then, of course, customers are adapting to this new work environment, and we see that in the form of strong sales funnels and our order book growth. Even service levels are at or near normal as we have much better site access than we have had for more normalized operation. And we're also seeing an uptick in instrument revenue as customers are starting to initiate new projects, upgrading and doing some capital investments. Now as I've mentioned here just a minute ago, from a COVID testing perspective, we still see the point-of-care testing at Cepheid easy workflow, the right answer being in short turnaround being the solution, the durable solution. And we see Cepheid actually accelerating here to 45 million tests versus the 36 million tests that we've spoken about. So we're seeing no falloff in demand for Cepheid tests. And the way to think about that is we did about 10 million here in Q1 and expect to increase by one million about each quarter. So 11 million in Q2, 12 million in Q3 and 13 million in Q4. And an important point to recognize here is our mix in Q1, COVID only versus foreign one was 50-50. Now as we go into the summer months here in the Northern Hemisphere, we see that mix going from 50-50 in Q1 to 80-20, 80 COVID, only 20 for 1 [ph] for Q2 and Q3. And then for Q4, we see that going back to - as we enter flu season and so forth, back to 50-50. So keep that in mind from a mix assumption perspective. Now if you look at this by segment, we see the Life Sciences growing over 20% here for the full year. Of course, bioprocessing that's non-COVID related, remains robust in the low double digits. As we've talked about, we're seeing our instruments improving. So if you think of like a microsystem, think about SCIEX, trends improved through 2021 as these projects are resuming as we speak and return to work. And then of course, the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics revenues we just talked about of about $2 billion. As you think about Diagnostics, here, we see ourselves in the high teens. Point of care, I talked about the expected 45 million tests at Cepheid as that capacity continues to build here through the year. And in our core and reference lab businesses, we see the volumes continuing to recover and the lockdown is really not having a material impact. So thinking about Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems in the low double digits here for the full year. And then from an EAS perspective, we see that in the mid single to high single digits as the consumables demand remains solid as it has been, but now we're starting to see equipment placements improving as well and in positive growth territories. And then lastly, if you build it out by geography, China, up over 20% for the year with a very strong recovery. North America, also in high teens, with Western Europe at low double digits. So that's how we're thinking about the frame here, by business as well as by geography, as well as base and COVID tailwind. Hopefully, that helps with that.
Doug Schenkel: Yes. That is super helpful, and that's a lot of great detail. Maybe a very quick follow-up. And I think you sort of alluded to this or referred to this at the end, Rainer. But in terms of just high growth markets, growth was extremely strong in the first quarter. Some of that, I think, was just fundamental improvement. Some of that was favorable comps. But just kind of your last point, it does sound like you're expecting some sustained improvement in high growth market growth over the balance of the year, that kind of what we saw in Q1 is expected to be sustainable.
Rainer Blair: We do. As you correctly point out, China, in particular, Q1 last year essentially was shut down. So the first quarter numbers we're very, very high. But having said that, not only in the market but also in our businesses, we see sustained, very strong growth in the high-growth markets, China being the best example of that with growth over 20% for the full year.
Doug Schenkel: Great. okay. Thank you, again.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Scott.
Scott Davis: Good morning, Rainer and Matt. And Matt, good morning. Yes. Can you hear me, guys?
Rainer Blair: Yes.
Matt McGrew: Yes, we can hear you. You're good.
Scott Davis: Okay. Okay. Good. I have a new headset, so I'm not sure if it works or not. So hopefully, it works. But anyways, Rainer, you talked a little bit about the capacity adds. Can you give us a little sense of the kind of the scope, how - I mean, you're talking about adding new lines in existing facilities? Are you talking about new facilities? And are you in process on this? Or is it done? Just a little bit of color around that would be helpful.
Rainer Blair: So we are talking about all of that, Scott. We are opening up new facilities. For example, we're starting up a new plant in South Carolina. That will be targeted initially at single-use technologies, will be coming online, supporting both Pall Biotech as well as Cytiva. We've recently completed a small deal in China, buying out our joint venture partner and are expanding our single-use technology capacities on the ground in China as well. And then we have additional lines going in, in several facilities throughout the developed market. Once again, for single-use technologies, but also other biopharma-related portfolio increases. So all of the above and coming online here in the shorter term.
Scott Davis: Now to the 40% incrementals that you're guiding to, which obviously seems conservative based on your history, is the new capacity - I mean, it probably comes in at a fairly low profit level at first. Does that play into this guidance at all? Or is it not really a big issue?
Matt McGrew: No, Scott. It's not a huge issue for us in this year. I mean a lot of the stuff, too, when you think about what's coming online, think about capacity at Cepheid, that's pretty good margin for us. So if anything, it's probably on the margin, helpful, but it won't be a big drag.
Scott Davis: Okay. All right. Good luck, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks for the questions. And congrats on the quarter. Maybe a two parter on COVID. So it's interesting, the outlook for 2022 that Cepheid will remain consistent with '21. Can you just share some of your assumptions around that? Like what's kind of implied here are you thinking? And how are you thinking about the overall testing market that kind of gets you to that number? And then b, just on the vaccine therapeutics. I know kind of maybe dovetailing on kind of Scott's question in terms of capacity. Just what - can you share with us kind of where you are today from a total capacity in terms of being able to meet the demand that you see? How tight things are? And then as eventually COVID flows with the additional capacity building out, kind of how does that filter into the base bioproduction business?
Rainer Blair: So let's start with COVID testing and the durability of that, Cepheid coming back really to what we're seeing today. We see no slowdown in the demand for Cepheid tests for COVID. So while the market, as I mentioned earlier, might peak this year in terms of testing, and we'll see if that's the case. But if we take that assumption, we continue to see that the value proposition that Cepheid offers at the point of care and as those tests wander from more distant testing setting back to the point of care that Cepheid's value proposition there in terms of workflow, speed and accuracy are really in the center of that concentric circle, and it's really - that's so important here to keep in mind. Also, we've increased the installed base of the gene experts now since the beginning of last year by over 40%. So a significant installed base increase. And that's actually the largest installed base of molecular diagnostics point-of-care test around the globe. At the same time, our broad menu, 30 tests approved outside the US, 20 inside of the US, is getting us into a care setting that we expect to provide strong durability here for the future. So that's what allows us here as we continue to increase capacity quarter-over-quarter to continue to increase our shipments. And as you think about 2022 going forward, first of all, the vaccines will take likely years to roll out to the entire world. Secondly, their effectiveness is on a continuum, some of them as high as 95%, others in the mid-60s. And so we're already seeing breakthrough infection. And there's also a number of people around the world who prefer not to get vaccinated. So testing will be continuing and very likely so at the point of care. And that just gives us the confidence based also on our conversations with our customers who are giving us outlook here for the next 18 to 24 months, that we're going to be able to maintain in 2022, the level of test shipment that we had here in 2021. So 45 million is what we're looking for, for 2021. Now as we think about - to your question on total capacity, is capacity tight? I think certainly, we are running very hard. But as I've mentioned in other settings, we have invested continuously here over the last 18 months in expanding our capacity. If we think about Cytiva in particular, even prior to the close with GE, we had an arrangement where we continued to increase capacity, and we've continued to invest very significantly in those capacity increases. So we're working together with our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we're able to supply the needs here in 2021 and going forward. Now to the other aspect of your question, once you have this capacity online, should vaccination and therapeutics peak, how do we think about that capacity going forward? And here, again, we're very bullish based on the development pipeline of biologic drugs, which continues to grow significantly. So even if you put COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics aside, the capacity requirements going forward continue to be significant. We're very confident that the capacity investments that we make today and tomorrow are very much needed here to supply the future needs of our customers. And they're certainly in dialogue with us specifically on that point.
Dan Brennan: Sounds terrific, Rainer. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Just on Cepheid, I know it's been asked in the past, but we did, did a survey that showed there's likely to be a continued high usage level for a lot of these boxes that are placed. Just as we get beyond COVID, just any way to think about what Cepheid was like the growth rate you were thinking about before COVID and what that could be now given this dramatically larger installed base in the sense of how much of these boxes going to continue to get used beyond COVID? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Well, you've heard us speak about our frame of pre-pandemic and sort of post-herd immunity or post vaccination, where we saw Cepheid really growing in the low double digits pre-pandemic based on the menu at that time, which we've since expanded and will continue to expand going forward. And so the way we think about it is, at the very minimum, we should be able to drive continued low double-digit growth at Cepheid on the one hand. On the other hand, we do have now an endemic disease, COVID-19, and you really need to layer that type of testing on top of sort of this base testing rate that we have seen in the past. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's what gives us confidence in the durability here, both in the near term and in the future.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you, Rainer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Dan.
Dan Leonard: Hello. So a few questions. First off, on the guidance, I appreciate all the line item detail. But at a high level, how much conservatism do you think is still baked into that high single-digit view on the base business outlook given all of your commentary in the low single-digit comp?
Rainer Blair: So as we look at our base business, we really see this as an appropriate view of what remains here of the year, and there's good reason for that. We continue to see labs opening up, patient volumes return. In the base business, we see in our Environmental & Applied Solutions business activity levels continue to pick up with our consumables running at a good strong rate and instrument continuing to be placed here as capital project go forward. And this is why we've increased that forecast on the base business from mid single to high single digits, and we think that's appropriate. As we look for the year, we still have a good part of the year ahead of us and think that's the appropriate way to think about it.
Dan Leonard: Okay. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up. How are you thinking about prospects for inflation and your ability to offset inflationary pressures, maybe even from incremental efficiencies you've learned from operating during a lockdown?
Rainer Blair: We've been in these kinds of environments before, and the Danaher Business System and the tool set that we apply every day really helps us to offset this. On the one hand, we're working closely with our suppliers and ensuring that we are working our price performance variations and the tool sets that we have there. Of course, we value engineer every day of the week. And then going forward, we also work on the pricing side to ensure that we're able to protect our margins and ensure that we capture the value of our differentiated and oftentimes IP-protected solutions going forward.
Dan Leonard: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one more question. Your final question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Hey, how are you guys? Thanks. Rainer, you touched on it a little bit a couple of questions ago, but I wanted to drill in on the bioprocessing piece outside of the vaccine. Obviously, vaccine demand gets a lot on the headlines understandably. But can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market, kind of the underlying demand in the bioprocessing, bioproduction world? What do you think that market growth rate looks like over the next few years? And then to your point, how confident you are in that demand being enough to kind of fill the capacity that you're building out in the post-vaccine world, which, again, to your point, feels like it's multiple years away? But just wanted to talk about that market a little bit 
Rainer Blair: Sure, Patrick. There is a number of data points to consider here. Let me start with the fact that biologic drugs are highly efficacious and in very great demand, and that the penetration of these drugs throughout the world is still in the single-digit percentages, again, speaking now outside of COVID vaccine. So the penetration of these highly efficacious drug is still relatively low. On the other hand, when you look at the surge of capital investment that we see going into drug development, whether that be in traditional pharma or small biotech and throughout the world, we see that the drug pipeline and the associated number of drugs in the clinical - in clinical trials continues to ramp very significantly. And even if you apply sort of traditional success rates to the number of projects in those pipelines, you have to expect a very, very solid and continued growth here for the future, and we certainly do. And we expect that growth to be in the low double digits here on a sustained basis. And if you have any sort of additional leverage here as it relates to the transition from, for instance, stainless steel manufacturing solutions to single-use technologies for greater flexibility and ease of use and lower risk of cross-contamination, that provides additional impulses and catalysts to the growth rate, which will require the capacity that you see coming online. So we're very confident that the capacity that we're putting in place for our customers and to support their future growth is required here in the future.
Patrick Donnelly: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to follow up on one of the cap deployment questions from earlier. We've seen some peers kind of step into other industries like the CRO world. I know you've talked a little bit about your interest or lack thereof in that type of space previously, but some thinking has evolved in other places. So I was wondering, is that a market that you'd be interested in getting into? And just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
Rainer Blair: So we obviously don't want to comment on specific things happening here in the market. But what I can say is that we're really happy with the approach that we've taken with the acquisitions of Cytiva, Pall, IDT and Phenomenex. We're providing very specific practical and material solutions to our customer’s pain points. These are all companies that are in the forefront of technologies with proprietary solutions, with high number of touch points and high customer intimacy and very importantly, recurring revenue, which is exactly the kind of businesses that we want to be in. And once again, coming back to the nature of this industry, in this industry, more often than not, scientists are making - or at the very minimum, heavily influencing the purchasing decision as opposed to economic bundles really being a point of leverage. And why is that? Because the value in getting a, for instance, biologic drug to market faster by just one week, if it's a $1 billion drug a year, is $20 million. The value of increasing your yield by 2% to 5% is several tens of millions of dollars. So that's how we think about the fact that our strategy and the way we're focused is, is the way to be.
Patrick Donnelly: Very helpful. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. I will now return the call to Matt Gugino for any closing comments.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Lori, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're around all day for questions.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Danaher Corporation's first quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 08:00:00) =====

As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales, references to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth comparing to current period Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to the acquisition. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year. As we all know, 2020 was the year that brought many unforeseen challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our contributions and testing, treatment and vaccination have helped with the global effort to combat COVID-19, there is still much more progress to be made to overcome the pandemic.  It's also not lost on us that part of our financial performance in 2020 was driven by the work we're doing to tackle a health crisis which has had such a devastating impact on so many around the world.  That being said, we're also very proud of our contributions to fight the pandemic. And we'll continue to work tirelessly to support these global efforts in 2021 and beyond, as necessary.  So, as I look back on 2020, I'm most struck by our associates' teamwork, dedication and invaluable contributions during these difficult times. They are truly making a difference in the world.  And since the onset of the pandemic, our team has met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to help our customers, patients and the global community. Their efforts have been both humbling and inspiring.  I'd also like to recognize and thank our customers, suppliers, and business partners, many of whom we called upon for additional support to continue meeting demand throughout this pandemic. We're incredibly grateful and won't forget their collective efforts over the past year.  One of our five core values at Danaher is the best team wins. And I believe we truly saw that in action in 2020.  So with that, let's turn to our 2020 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue growth, 170 basis points of core operating margin expansion, 43% earnings per share growth, and over $5 billion of free cash flow.  We also closed the largest acquisition in our history, welcoming Cytiva team to Danaher in March of last year. Cytiva is a global leader in bio processing and has played a major role in supporting the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics.  In 2020, the business generated more than 25% core revenue growth and over $4 billion of revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with Cytiva's early results, all driven by a highly talented, engaged and innovative team that has embraced the Danaher business system.  So, now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. We generated $6.8 billion of sales with 15.5% core revenue growth and believe we continued to capture market share across many of our businesses through accelerated investment and new product innovation, enhanced commercial execution, and by deploying new engagement techniques, new customer engagement techniques during the pandemic. COVID related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,200 basis points to core revenue growth, while our underlying base business was up approximately 3.5%.  Geographically, we saw broad-based and consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Developed markets were up mid-teens, with similar growth in both the US and Western Europe. High growth markets were up low double-digits, driven by another excellent quarter in China.  Our gross profit margin was 58.5%. And our operating profit margin of 23.7% was up 390 basis points, including 360 basis points of core margin expansion.  Our outstanding margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core revenue growth and the impact of the Danaher business system on productivity and operations across all of our platforms. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.08 was up 63% versus last year. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion for the full year, up 134% and 79%, respectively.  Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 149% for the full year and marks the 29th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. The combination of our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet gives us more degrees of freedom earlier than anticipated after the Cytiva closing and positions as well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities.  Given our strong margin and cash flow performance, we took the opportunity to accelerate investments and high impact growth initiatives across Danaher, including innovation and collaboration projects.  We're also expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand for COVID-related testing and treatments, while positioning the businesses for continued long-term growth.  So, now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increase as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, with core revenue of 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 30% or more at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, Beckman Life Sciences, and IDT.  We continue to see strong demand from our biopharma customers during the quarter and our non-COVID related biopharma business was up double digit, and we also saw an acceleration in activity focused on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We also saw customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities to support the development and production of COVID-related tests and treatments.  In our more instrument oriented Life Science businesses, order trends and installations improved as academic and research labs continued to reopen.  SCIEX benefited from this uptick in activity and delivered mid-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by demand for new products, such as the 7500 Triple Quad and the Echo MS.  Moving over to diagnostics, reported revenue was up 23.5%, with core revenue up21.5%, led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid, driven by elevated COVID-19 testing demand and GeneXpert Systems placement. Cepheid achieved a significant milestone in December, the passing $2 billion in annual revenue just one year after hitting the $1 billion mark. It's a tremendous accomplishment by a fantastic team. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, both delivered high single digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks steadily resumed through the quarter.  Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue was up 2% and core revenue was up 1%. Our water quality platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth and product identification was down slightly.  Across our water quality businesses, we saw solid demand for our consumables and chemistries as we continued to support customers day-to-day mission-critical water operations.  Equipment declines moderated as more customer facilities got back up and running. And by end market, municipal activity and project continued to resume and industrial declines moderated. ChemTreat delivered its 52nd consecutive year of core revenue growth in 2020, an impressive accomplishment in any year, but even more so given the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic.  Across our water quality platform, the team's focused execution, combined with our innovative offering and the positioning of our portfolio, enabled the water quality platform to achieve positive core revenue growth for the full year. At our product identification platform, positive results in our marking and coding businesses were offset by moderating declines in packaging and color management. Consumables and services held up well globally as we continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic.  So, with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let me give you some color on the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies.  Customer activity around the world remains broadly consistent with what we saw back in October and through the fourth quarter, and we expect this relative stability to persist near term.  Despite rising COVID infection rates and new targeted lockdowns in certain regions, customers are adapting to working in this new pandemic environment and we have not yet seen a material impact on demand.  Within Life Sciences, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity continues to drive record bioprocessing demand. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bio processing exposure, and their combined order growth in the quarter was up more than 50%.  As a market leader across the bio processing workflow, our teams are playing a significant role in the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, while working to ramp up manufacturing capabilities on a massive and very compressed timeline.  We are involved in the majority of more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway globally, including all of the vaccines in the US that have recently received FDA emergency use authorization or are in late stage clinical trials. We're very proud of our team's tireless efforts which will directly impact the lives of so many people around the world.  From where we stand today, we estimate the 2021 revenue opportunity associated with COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics at Cytiva and Pall Biotech will be approximately $1.3 billion, roughly twice the amount we recognized in 2020. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains strong and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. Turning to our other life science end market, and as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs are continuing to reopen, albeit at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people in the lab at any one time.  In clinical diagnostics, heightened demand continues for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point of care settings. Since launching the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped approximately 9 million test cartridges in the fourth quarter.  As anticipated, approximately 60% of the respiratory tests shipped in the fourth quarter were COVID-only tests and 40% were four-in-one combination tests for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV.  The team also placed a record number of new systems in 2020, increasing Cepheid's installed base by more than 35% year-over-year to over 30,000 instruments globally, and reinforcing its market-leading position in molecular diagnostics.  Cepheid's differentiated offering and leading presence at the point of care position the business to help meet customers testing needs in 2021 and beyond. As a result of this strong positioning and the elevated COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates we are still seeing today, we expect to ship at least 9 million tests per quarter for the duration of 2021.  Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes remained steady as elective procedures and wellness checks continue at a similar pace as we saw through Q4. We're closely monitoring patient activity in areas that have recently implemented new lockdowns, but we've not seen any material impact at this point.  During the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics expanded its COVID-related test menu with the addition of a high volume antigen test. This automated test is designed to run on Beckman's immunoassay analyzers and can help address the challenges associated with scaling up antigen testing to make higher volume mass testing possible.  Beckman's automated antigen test is another important addition to our COVID diagnostics offering and a testament to the Beckman team's strong cadence of innovation, having launched six new COVID related tests in as many months. Finally, in the applied markets, consumables remained solid as customers sustain essential business operations, like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And we're encouraged to see sequential improvements on the equipment side as customers initiate new project and capital investments.  Looking ahead now to the first quarter and full year 2021. We expect to deliver mid to high teens core revenue growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 1,300 basis points to core revenue growth, with mid-single digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID related businesses.  For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth, with growth moderating sequentially in the second half of the year as a result of tougher prior-year comparisons.  We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 500 basis points to core revenue growth for the full year, with mid to high-single digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID related businesses.  So, to wrap up, 2020 was an exceptional year for Danaher. Our team took the challenges presented by the pandemic and turned them into opportunities to support customers across all of our businesses and also directly contribute to the fight against COVID-19. We're all humbled by our associates efforts and believe that Danaher's future is bright, thanks to their dedication.  2020 was also a transformative year for Danaher, with the addition of Cytiva. This was one of several strategic portfolio moves we have made over the last few years to build a better, stronger company, and establish Danaher as a global science and technology leader.  Looking ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, excellent portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher business system, positioned Danaher to outperform in 2021 and beyond.  So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. 
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Maria, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Nice quarter. Rainer, I'm curious if you could talk about the sustainability of the Pall, Cytiva order book as you lap tougher comps. I know you talked about the $1.3 billion in revenues tied to COVID vaccines, but question is more on kind of the order book and then timelines for the manufacturing capacity expansion you alluded to.
Rainer Blair: In terms of the sustainability of the order book, the way we're thinking about this, and we've mentioned this at J.P. Morgan as well, is about – we're looking at a backlog here of about $1 billion coming into the first quarter and we expect the total year to have COVID-related sales of about $1.3 billion. And that's really based on the approved vaccines that we see out there in the marketplace, as well as the volumes that we see related to clinical trials as it relates to other vaccines. So, we think that we have good sustainability and strong backlog here to be able to make sure that we cover that $1.3 billion.  Additionally, and coming back to your capacity point, we have been expanding capacity continuously, even prior to the close of the transaction we had agreed with GE to continue capacity expansion. We had then, after the close, continued to invest whether that with Cytiva, Pall Biotech or elsewhere in order to make sure that we are able to meet our customers' demand, and that will continue to occur here through the year 2021 and beyond.
Tycho Peterson: For McGrew, one on just the margin dynamics here. As we think about Cepheid, 9 million tests a quarter and then Cytiva, Pall continued to kind of trend at these levels, what were the margin implications between these two tailwinds in your view for the year?
Matt McGrew: Tycho, maybe the way to think about it is that it helps to kind of sustain a similar margin profile to what we've seen before. So, maybe if you think about from a fall through perspective on the core growth here for 2021, and frankly for Q1 as well, we are sort of assuming we are going to see about a 40% or so fall through, like I said, for both Q1 and 2021.  Now, that's down slightly from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. But I think we want to stay aggressive in what we've been doing on the growth investment side, one. And two, we are starting to see a little bit of inflationary pressure, particularly around freight and a little bit in the supply chain as well. And then, China also is – we've got some targeted lockdowns, as you know now. But in the fourth quarter, we really saw China sort of having inter-country, if you will, travel be pretty significant. They're moving – they're moving around quite a bit and getting back at it.  So, I think we're sort of thinking instead of maybe the levels of fall through we've seen, it might be more like 40%. But again, I think we will be able to hopefully sustain something like that, given what you talked about, which is pretty good margin profile, both those businesses that will continue to be pretty strong here next year.
Tycho Peterson: If I could ask one more before I hop off just on M&A. Rainer, it seems like you're telegraphing a desire to do something more meaningful. Any incremental color you could provide on willingness to do a larger transaction and any framework you can talk about?
Rainer Blair: It's great to be able to talk about M&A here in January of 2021 having just closed the Cytiva deal. And no question, between the better performance that we've seen out of Cepheid – I'm sorry Cytiva, as well as the equity raise that we've done and the free cash flow that we've seen, we definitely see more degrees of freedom here earlier than we've had. But we still have work to do here with Cytiva, standing them up as an operating company, and we'll always be in the game, but likely more focused on smaller to mid-size deals here for now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: I guess just following up on Tycho's question on the margins and just sort of thinking about the bottom line. You didn't give an EPS guidance for 2021, but is there any reason to think that something in that $1.90 to $2 range on a quarterly basis isn't sustainable for the rest of the year?
Matt McGrew: I think I'd kind of go back to take your 40% VCM and the fall through and whatever revenue assumptions you sort of put in, I think the math would kind of take care itself.
Derik De Bruin: One big question that's coming up from investors is thinking about instrument placements in the diagnostics area. Obviously, not only has Cepheid placed a ton of instruments, but a lot of your competitors, all your other companies selling molecular diagnostic tools have placed enormous numbers of instruments. Are you worried that there is going to be a glut of machines out there that don't get used, or are you being very selective in sort of like where you're placing it? The question is like, what's going to be the follow-on demand once we're sort of past COVID for your installed base?
Rainer Blair: Our instrument placements as we think about Cepheid, we have placed now and have an installed base of over 30,000 instruments, growing that over 35% here in the year 2020. And we've been very thoughtful about the placement of those instruments.  First of all, and helping here during the pandemic and making sure we have those at the point of care where diagnostic decisions are being made and the answer has to be fast, and it has to be right, and the Cepheid GeneXpert is just a perfect solution for that.  At the same time, we've been thinking about those placements for the long-term. You may be aware that Cepheid has the largest molecular diagnostic menu in US with over 20 tests and outside of the US with over 30 tests. And so, we've placed those instruments primarily there, where we see that even in a post-COVID world, they would find great utilization based on the full testing menu.
Derik De Bruin: Just one cleanup question or just one follow-up question. How should we think about the EAS segment in 2021?
Rainer Blair: The EAS segment has been improving sequentially here throughout 2020. And we're really pleased with the fact that water quality in particular has had positive growth, but also PID was essentially flat here in 2020 as well. And so, we see that recovery, and we will continue to see that recovery here as we go through 2021 and expect them to be in the mid-single digit range, not only as the consumables remain solid as they have been, but as those instrument placements which have been in moderating decline start picking up, as we've seen these customer projects in our funnel.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Congrats on a solid print here. Rainer, maybe I'll start with some of the base business here, right? The assumptions here for the guide in a base business at mid-singles and obviously the comps were pretty easy in 2020 given the disruptions. And I look at the Q1 guide here, mid-to-high teens, you guys just at mid-teens inclusive of days impact. Correct me if I'm wrong. It feels like the base business is accelerating here in the Life Science, particularly it seems to be growing double-digits in the back half of 2020. I'm curious what's driving that acceleration in base Life Sciences in the back half of 2020 and why is the guide assuming mid-singles for 2021?
Rainer Blair: Vijay, that's right. We have seen a sequential acceleration of our more instrument-related life science businesses as labs have continued to open. They've been able to work out their social distancing protocols. They are not up to full capacity yet, but they certainly have been improving and that's given us more lab access to continue installations and of course bring the service business back online. So, that's been continuously improving and we would expect that trend to continue here in 2021.  Now, as we think about the guide here, mid-to-high teens, look, we have our base business there at mid-single digits, which is 100, 150 basis points acceleration as well as the COVID tailwind accelerating here to 1,300 basis points. So, we think we're well placed there.  And just as a reminder, we've got a couple of working days less also in the first quarter of 2021.  And then lastly, as it relates to the COVID tailwinds, keep in mind that Cepheid already last year in the first quarter had a very strong quarter as physicians were trying to rule out flu, if you will, with more flu testing in the absence of an actual COVID test.
Vijay Kumar : One for Matt. Matt, I know you said the 40% incrementals, we can do the math, but I just want to clarify, I'm getting to north of 28% operating margins for fiscal 2021. Does that seem ballpark – in the right zip code for you guys?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. Again, if you think about the fall through at kind of 40%, there are some moving pieces here below the line, but they largely offset each other. So, I think it is pretty straightforward that whatever your revenue assumptions are going to be that that should be a pretty good way to think about. Where we land on that I think will dictate where you come out on the bottom for sure.
Vijay Kumar : Rainer, one last quick one for you, please, on the high volume antigen test. I know you sort of mentioned in your press release about screening opportunity. Is that an upside in the model here for the guide or how should we think about up high volume antigen tests?
Rainer Blair: The high volume antigen tests, you're right, we just launched that here in December. And in fact, that will be available on our installed base of about 16,000 instruments. So it is a broadly applicable test for us here in our installed base at Beckman.  Having said that, we've been very moderate in our planning assumptions here as it relates to including higher volumes of antigen test until it becomes much clear on how those will be applied here, not just under the Biden administration in the US, but throughout the world as people start setting standards as to what the test results for antigens mean from a diagnostics perspective, but also in terms of how you might think of large volume serial testing for schools opening up and other institutions.
Vijay Kumar : Congrats again guys on the impressive print here. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Just one nitpicky question. On E&AS, is there a meaningful difference between the incremental leverage on the recovery in water versus product ID?
Rainer Blair: Not really, Scott. Those businesses are pretty similar from a fall through perspective.
Scott Davis: Like 35% to 40% ballpark?
Rainer Blair: I think that's a great place to be.
Scott Davis: Okay. And then when you guys were thinking in terms of like the four-in-one versus – the four-in-one take rates, the 40% number, is that kind of uniform around different geographies or is there a particular higher take rates in different geographies around the world?
Rainer Blair: Scott, so it actually does differ by geography. Let me see if I can do something about the echo here. Can you hear me okay now?
Scott Davis: I can you hear you fine.
Rainer Blair: Okay. So, that differs by geographies, particularly in the US, you are looking at 60% COVID-only and 40% of the four-in-one. In Asia, in fact, there is a real pressure for the COVID-only test as the flu is not as prevalent there and as seasonal. As you go to Europe, here we increased adoption of the four-in-one, but that's a little staggered as the improvement by country roll in.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Maybe just a quick follow-up on an earlier guidance question. It looks like you're assuming a two-year stack base business growth of around 5%. That doesn't seem to imply a full recovery as we think about the steady state for your portfolio. So, just to be clear – and I think we know the answer to this, but I just want to confirm it, seems like the philosophy for this year embed some assumption for continued recovery in line with recent trend that's based on backlog, but not a full reopening over the course of the year.
Rainer Blair: Doug, that's exactly how we're thinking about it. We are still in the middle of the pandemic, as we all know. And while we're hopeful that things get better as the vaccines rollout and the adoption there improves, we are not expecting 2021 to be a year that is, if you will, a post-COVID herd immunity year. This is going to continue to be a transition year and probably not quite back to the pre-COVID rate.
Doug Schenkel: Pivoting quickly back over to Cepheid, I believe, Rainer, that you said that the guidance assumes Cepheid should continue to sell around 9 million assays per quarter in 2021. It doesn't seem like that's reflecting any potential capacity increases. I just want to make sure that's the case. And if so, why? And then kind of building off of that, is the expectation that the mix of kind of COVID only and four-in-one test will remain kind of in that 60/40 ratio?
Rainer Blair: Let's start with the first one. And as you may know, we in Q2 of last year shipped 6 million, 7 million in Q3. We were planning to ship 8 million cartridges here in Q4 and we were able to exceed that by shipping 9 million. So, as we think about our capacity improvements, which we continue to work on, we do not yet have those in place. And in view of the pretty dynamic situation, also as it relates to the actual pandemic, we think it's a good planning number to take the 9 million cartridges here per quarter for the full year. And of course, as we continue to work on, and we are working on and investing in capacity increases, we'll provide further updates.  Now in terms of the mix, I think that is a good planning assumption, the way you're thinking about that, with 60% COVID-only tests and about 40% of the four-in-one test. That's how we're thinking about it as well.
Doug Schenkel: Just one last one. I just want to dig in on your comments regarding capacity expansion within bio-processing. Presumably, at some point, you're going to be well positioned to transition-out the building COVID-19 capacity over to other large molecules. You were building that out even in advance of the pandemic, as you've mentioned in your prepared remarks. So, do you think that bio-processing revenue can be sustained at 2021 levels even when we look forward to the day where vaccine and therapeutic tailwinds related to COVID-19 abate? Do you think there is an air pocket or a sustainable demand that trends enough to support revenue at least at 2021 levels?
Rainer Blair: Well, when we look at that pipeline of drugs and vaccines, so therapeutics and vaccines, that are not COVID-related as well and it's chockfull, it continues to grow and that business has been very, very solid. So, there's a couple of things here, Doug. One we expect that pipeline to be very relevant to the capacity that's being traded today. In fact many of our investments are nearly pulling forward things that we had planned for several years down the road. That's kind of one point. But the second point is that, it also looks as though vaccine manufacturing will be with us for some time, not only as it relates to COVID, but as you think about the bolus of investment that is now gone into biotech companies that are looking at new vaccine technologies to get at diseases where we've yet to develop vaccines. We do see increasing number of projects there as well. So, as it relates to this incremental capacity, we feel really good about where we're positioned, got the right portfolio and we think our utilization is going to be very strong.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, just to give you a little bit of color around kind of the capacity side and maybe tying that back to how we're thinking about the sustainability of what we're seeing today, I think as Rainer said, as everything he just kind of laid out, when you think about what we've seen in the core base biopharma business, we've seen last three or four quarters here where we've got a low double-digit kind of core growth, and that's even probably a little bit above where it was a couple of years ago, given everything Rainer just said.  Now when you put on top of that what we've seen here on the vaccines and therapeutics, still lot of unknowns obviously going forward, but you're looking at, as we talked in Q2 and Q3, the order growth at Cytiva was well north of 50 and it was north of 50 again in Q4. So, I really think we've got good sustainability as we head into 2021, given the backlog, given what we saw in order growth in Cytiva in Q4 and given the base business, sort of going low-double digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.
Steve Beuchaw: I actually wanted to rewind almost all the way back to the beginning of your prepared remarks, Rainer, and a point that you made about accelerating investments in innovation and collaboration. It's one of the sort of high-quality problems that has emerged for companies that are part of the solution around COVID. I wonder if you could talk us through how you've gone about identifying areas to make those investments. And if you could flag for us any particular areas of emphasis, I'd really appreciate it. And I do have one follow-up.
Rainer Blair: The way we've been thinking about these growth investments is very broad across our portfolio. We've always looked at this as an opportunity to strengthen our capabilities and exit the pandemic stronger than we entered, whether that's in businesses that are benefiting from COVID tailwinds or businesses that are not in that particular application. And so, what we do is we work together with our teams to identify where the most attractive projects are, not just on a return perspective here in the near-term, but also strategically positioning us for competitive advantage and then we will invest aggressively in those and that's been the case here for several quarters now. So, we'll continue to do that.
Steve Beuchaw: Look, a lot of good questions have been asked about margins, earnings and the businesses. I'll try to round it out a little bit and just ask about core Beck Dx. I wonder if you could give us a perspective on where you are with the DxA rollout in the replacement cycle and to what extent COVID has impacted that. I could see it having some puts and takes. So any perspective on how that's going and what you're thinking about for core Beckman – core Beck Dx, I should say, for 2021, would really appreciate it. 
Rainer Blair: I was just going to say, we've just launched the DxA and we couldn't be more pleased with the initial interest in that. But if we back up to the Beckman Diagnostics business for a second and see how that's been performing, we've continued to see sequential improvements here quarter-over-quarter and practically every region and couldn't be more pleased with the way, in fact, that business has positioned. You were speaking earlier about these kinds of growth investments that we're making. Well, we've just launched the hematology analyzers along with the DxA for the DxH's 9000 and 5000, as well as just launched six new COVID-related tests. So, that's just an example of your first question also as it relates directly to Beckman Dx. So, we've been tracking exactly what we wanted to hear with the DxA and that's been really going well for us.  Matt, did you want to add anything there?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, I just wanted to sort of address the question of what we thought they'd do from a growth perspective here in 2021. And I think we're sort of thinking that as the rebound continues a little bit with the patient volumes, we expect them to be up sort of high-single digits here for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan at Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on expectations around capital equipment. So, you obviously ended the year on a strong note, but just given some of the recent flare-ups, do you think that sustains as you go into the first half of the year?
Rainer Blair: Jack, you are right. We have seen the capital equipment purchases picking up here. As labs open up, that's increased. And then we close very strong here. We saw that in many of those instrument type businesses in the end of Q4, with some high-single digit performance there. In fact, we continue to see that. We've pulled our businesses and customers and they're learning to work around the pandemic with the necessary social distancing measures. And we continue to see that accelerating here going into 2021 and we see that also reflected in our guide here for both Q1 as well as at a low double digits for 2021.
Jack Meehan: I know you've given a lot of color already on bioprocessing, but one follow-up just on the expectations built into the guidance. So, you have it roughly doubling the $1.3 billion from COVID tailwinds in 2021, but that kind of looks like you're annualizing the benefit you saw in the second half. So, is there anything – maybe just talk about how you see the demand playing out throughout the year. And is there anything tailing off maybe on the therapeutic side? What are you assuming there?
Rainer Blair: As we think about the bioprocess order book, recall that we had orders growth at Cytiva and Pall Biotech of over 50% here in Q4 and that was a further acceleration from what we had seen and we expect that acceleration here to continue. So, our backlog position is really strong. We entered the year with $1 billion and we are confident that that $1.3 billion of revenue are really solid.  But that also had some assumptions behind it, which is, here we are supplying the approved vaccines, as well as those that are in clinical trials. And you know we're well positioned not just on the vaccines in Project Warp Speed, but the over 400 projects that you have both vaccines and therapeutics. So, as you think about 2021, while we do expect a moderation in the second half of the year, that's entirely related to more difficult comps as opposed to a trailing off of the actual absolute demand. So, we believe that that will continue.
Matt McGrew: To give you some sense, Jack, on how that order book is going to flow through, we saw at Cytiva and Pall Biotech, in the second half of the year, we grew, call it, north of 35%. We've got that backlog position now. Some of what you said, some of it came in during the year and booked and shipped in the year to give us 35%, but we're going to get off to a pretty good start here at Cytiva. Q1 core growth in Cytiva is going to be probably north of 50%. So, I think we'll have a good strong start. Let's see how that order book sort of develops through the year as more vaccines and therapeutics sort of make their way through the systems to the approvals. But that's sort of how we've framed it as we stand now with kind of the $1.3 billion opportunity.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Maybe just a quick one, more high level on a geographic basis. China, I think was low double-digits in the quarter on a core growth basis. Can you just talk about the pace of the recovery there, which markets are growing strongly? And then also, just the expectations baked in for 2021 on that front?
Rainer Blair: As you say, we did see a very nice recovery in China here, both in Q4, as well as what we're planning here going forward. So, low double-digits in China in 2020 and that's really across the businesses. So, we saw that both in our Life Science and Diagnostics businesses as well as in EAS as China has really ramped here, not just in the healthcare sort of related businesses, but also in the applied markets.  And as you look forward to 2021, starting with Q1, we expect our businesses to be over 50% in China in terms of the growth in Q1. So, really getting out of the gates there very strongly. Of course, they had a lower comparison there in Q1 of 2020.  And as we think about the full year, we really see China in the mid-teens. So very solid performance, very strong recovery after a full year, which really came in at the low-single digit. So, 2020, China low-single digit; 2021, mid-teens, speaks to a strong recovery there.
Patrick Donnelly: Maybe just one more on Cepheid. I know it has been touched on a few times. But I guess as you think about kind of the sustainability of that $9 million a quarter, how are you thinking about the overall, I guess, COVID testing market in the back-half? Are you assuming that shrinks and Cepheid gets a bigger piece?  And then, on the back of that, do you see point-of-care becoming more and more important as we go here and maybe this ends up being a positive inflection point for this as a piece of the market on the go mode? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Looking to point-of-care here, and COVID testing in general to the second half, it's very hard to forecast right now how COVID testing will play out in the second half. Just because as we think about vaccines rolling out, we're already now talking about a variant, who knows how many more of those will occur. And of course, often the dialog tends to be about what's happening in the US, but, in fact, other places around the world are not vaccinating yet at that rate or even don't have vaccines yet. So, we think that that planning assumption of 9 million per quarter is a very solid planning assumption.  And then, as it relates to Cepheid in particular, at the point-of-care, you may have heard this concentric circle metaphor, but point-of-care is really at the center of that in terms of the durability of that testing for the long-term because that's where the doctors need fast turnaround time, that's where they need an accurate result because they're going to make a therapeutic decision. They're going to make a decision as to what happens next. And the outer portions of those concentric circles are the ones that have increasingly less durability as the general public becomes vaccinated and, over time, although it's going to be interesting to see whether that's achieved in the second half of the year, whether herd immunity is even relevant.  Keep in mind, herd immunity is not something that happens in a country. The whole world is a petri dish here. And if we continue to travel, interact with each other, there is a high likelihood that high testing volumes will continue for some time.
Operator: And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Matthew Gugino : Thanks, Rainer. Thanks, Matt. Thanks everyone for joining us here today. And we'll round our day for questions.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Maria.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Crystal and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation’s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Crystal. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today’s call, our third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 5, 2020. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the third quarter of 2020 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher’s overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales, references to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth comparing to current period Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to the acquisition. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Well, thanks Matt and good morning, everyone. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team’s dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. So, before we run through our third quarter results, I’d like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort and the team’s commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination tests for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments differ greatly. And this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome. Now, as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid’s easy-to-use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians testing arsenal and we are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team’s fast and innovative response to the pandemic. We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics’ new IgM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear and it’s complimentary to Beckman’s IgG tests, providing greater insight over the course of a patient’s infection and immune progression. While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post-vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies. We are also proud to support the scientific community’s pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva’s products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. As the market leader across the bio-processing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. So, now, let’s take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth, while our underlying base business was approximately up – was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens led by North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up approximately 10% driven by sequential improvement in China and India. Our gross profit margin was 54.8% and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points, with each of the three segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59% respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. We also continue to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher, with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19. So, now, let’s take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5% led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences, and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We are continuing to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continued to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment achieving low single-digit core revenue growth driven in part by demand for new products, such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market. Moving over to diagnostics, reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5% led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert System placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continue to resume throughout the quarter. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segments, reported revenue and core revenue were down 1% with similar results at both our water quality and product identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continued to resume driving growth in North America and China and this was offset by softness in the industrial end-markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remained steady, supporting customer’s mission-critical day-to-day water operations and equipment declines moderated and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running. Now, during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics Solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data and these capabilities combined with Hach’s deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers’ workflows. At our product identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end-markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let’s take a look at recent trends across our end-markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as phased re-openings proceed across these regions. We are keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels. Within Life Sciences, bio-processing demand continues to lead the way, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale of occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprised most of our bio-processing exposure and collectively these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bio-processing workflow. Non-COVID related bio-processing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. Now, as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time and we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity. And in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels. Moving to clinical diagnostics, we continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care settings. Since launching the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter. Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter expanding their market leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels, with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe given its earlier reopening. In the applied markets, consumables remain solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume and we are seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new project and capital investments. So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter, modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19 related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. So to wrap up, we are really pleased with our results this quarter and we are proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities and our strong performance is a testament to our associates focused execution and commitment to our customers. With the Danaher business system as our driving force and the powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future. Now, before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial month as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio and extraordinary team and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I have had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher business system and our culture of continuous improvement. It’s clear that DBS is what drives it. It’s who we are. It’s how we do what we do. It’s our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well, everywhere. So, our future is bright and I am excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments and innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward. So with that, I will turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Crystal, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line that Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Rainer, 50% order growth in Pall Cytiva was certainly impressive and a notable acceleration from last quarter. So, could you maybe just touch on the manufacturing scale-up you alluded to and how quickly can additional capacity come online and where are you making those investments?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So, first of all, good morning, Tycho and thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to backup one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We are incredibly well-positioned through the combination of course of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves. And then of course the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all the downstream fluid management filtration and chromatography solutions. And so I think what you saw there and that step up here, quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction, we are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline and we are playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so, the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of add-backs. And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here, going forward, we think that as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly as we think about ‘21 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there and just to give you a sense of that, we year-to-date have $1 billion, well over $1 billion of COVID-orders in the combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech. And that’s before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward.
Tycho Peterson: Great. And then maybe I guess a similar question on Cepheid. I know you have been committed to scaling up the manufacturing there and you talked about 8 million tests in the fourth quarter, but can you talk about where you think that needs to go from a capacity standpoint? And any headwinds we need to think about from a lighter flu season here for you guys in the fourth quarter and early next year? The flu trends early on are still kind of light. Thanks.
Rainer Blair: So. just to level set on that one, Tycho, we have had extraordinary demand for our COVID tests here from Cepheid. In fact, you noted in my comments that in Q2 we had 6 million tests shipped; in Q3, 7 million tests shipped; and now in Q4, we are looking at 8 million tests shipped. And we also at the same time, at the end of September, launched this 4-in-1 test, which really positions us uniquely and extraordinarily in order to be able to address the opportunity and the need in particular here as the flu season arrives. As you can imagine, as patients present, particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly and the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we are really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond.
Matt McGrew: And maybe just to put some numbers around that for you. So, if you think about sort of the capacity that we talked about at Cepheid, sort of to begin this, in Q2, we sort of had 6 million tests that we had. That increased to about 7 million here in Q3. And we expect that to go in Q4 to call it maybe closer to 8 million. And as we sort of ramp through ‘21, we are going to be adding additional capacity as well. Now, I am not sure exactly when we expect all of that to come online, but as that happens, we will sort of kind of keep people updated. But yes, for sure, we are going to add a little bit here in Q4 and then throughout 2021 as well.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thanks. I’ll hop off and let others step in. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik de Bruin: Hey, good morning. So, just to…
Rainer Blair: Hi, Derik.
Derik de Bruin: Follow-up on – hi, just to follow-up on Tycho’s question, just because I am getting some pings from investors. How are you thinking about pricing on the 4-in-1 test? And I mean, when we have done some calls with labs, I think there is some concern about how they are going to get reimbursed for some of these multiplex tests. Can you sort of talk through pricing and sort of like what’s – what is the strategy for your customers to get paid for these?
Rainer Blair: Sure, sure. So, let’s start off with, just to level set that we in fact have launched this 4-in-1 test here in September and are already shipping. And we are seeing great customer demand for that. So, customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and hospital, to be able to diagnose and help customers. Now, this test here – and, of course, this always depends on the type of customers. But the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test, and that compares to the COVID-only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth. But that gives you a sense of it. Now, from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test and that is going to be so useful for clinicians to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And then – so, as you think about that, today already there are multiplex tests being used for respiratory type ailments and they are used all the time. And so, we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don’t see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test.
Derik de Bruin: Great.
Matt McGrew: Derik, maybe just to give you a little bit of context, sorry as well on some numbers on that, on that 4-in-1, obviously, it’s got a higher price point, like we talked about. But just to make sure that we kind of level set on how we think about when that will come online. So, I think in Q4, thinking about maybe 60% of our test volume in Q4 is going to be COVID-only. And then the other 40% would be the 4-in-1. And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about – we are still going to be producing COVID-only, and the kind of staggered adoption because – one, you have got high growth markets that really don’t experience seasonal flu. So, the demand for that is just not going to be as high if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It is going to be country by country, it’s not going to be kind of uniform like it might be in the U.S. So, just maybe to think about from a modeling perspective, that split would be the way I think about that.
Derik de Bruin: Great. And the – I guess on that one – well, actually, let me follow-up on something else. And so, I guess, can you talk a little bit about the pacing in SCIEX and academic labs? I mean – and basically the – talk about are you see any signs of any increased activity in terms of like a fourth quarter budget flush? Just sort of like the end market dynamics and sort of what is going? I mean, you talked about labs being open, but what is really the spend potential there, and just sort of like what does the, sort of, customer spending environment look like?
Rainer Blair: Sure. So, Derik, we have seen lab activity around the world pick up. As we mentioned, we see China nearly at or at pre-pandemic level. And I would say in North America and Western Europe, we see those lab capacities at about 70% to 80%, which is a sequential improvement, and we saw that. And so, our teams are able to now get in to see the customers to install the systems, provide the services and so forth. But we still see some capacity limitations, as I mentioned earlier, related to social distancing measures and so forth. Now, having said that, in Q3, our tools business grew 10%, we are very happy about that. And that was driven certainly by IDT and Beckman Life Sciences, but also by new product launches which were incredibly important for us and our customers, for instance the Echo MS, which is the high throughput screening tool used in front of mass spectrometers which has been seeing an extraordinary uptake. The launch of the Triple Quad 7500, I mentioned that. That is the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market, seen great uptake for that. And that’s driving – that actually drove a positive low-single digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3. And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the Stellaris, a confocal microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So, this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace, more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services, has been helpful. But I think we have also been buffeted by these aggressive new product introductions that we have invested in here too for the future.
Derik de Bruin: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Scott.
Scott Davis: Good morning. Good morning, Rainer. Welcome.
Rainer Blair: Thank you.
Scott Davis: Hey, Rainer. Anything the board wants you to do kind of differently than your predecessor, anything to focus on differently?
Rainer Blair: That is a great question. And right now, I would also like to take this opportunity to start out with thanking Tom and the Board and all the associates for the fantastic transition that they have provided me here over the last months and getting me off to what is a great start here for Danaher in Q3. So, I have worked for Tom a decade, and with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the board, have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company, and you will see that I am very passionate about the topic of innovation. You heard me comment on that today already as well as talent. And so, you will see us to continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent, in our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company. Now, having said that, with all the similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which will continue to focus on M&A and, particularly, on making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward. And when I started this role, just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals, but certainly, initially with the balance sheet, I mean, some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation and that – one, our free cash flow is stronger, Cytiva’s performance is even better than expected and we couldn’t be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that’s really put us into a situation where we just have more degree of freedom. And so that from an M&A perspective also puts us in a position of being able to do certainly small and medium sized strategic deals, and then as we go forward, get back into a stronger position pretty quickly.
Scott Davis: That’s helpful, Rainer. Is Aquatic the type of deal that we should expect going forward? I am not sure you guys sized that. Maybe you could help us understand if that’s material or not?
Matt McGrew: So, yes, Scott, – I can give you a little color on at least the size of it. I mean, this is a deal in water for the Informatics, and Rainer can talk a little bit about it. But it’s a pretty small deal. I mean, it’s a sub-$20 million in revenue and profitability, call it, $80 million to $100 million type deal, kind of deal for us. So, it’s not huge.
Rainer Blair: But it is exemplary of the deals that we continue to like. It’s nothing new. You have seen us do technology deals here that strengthen and round out our portfolio and we like Aquatic Informatics positioning and capability. So, certainly, you will see more of those types of deals and we consider that a smaller one.
Scott Davis: Perfect. Well, good luck to you Rainer. We wish you well.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Doug. Welcome.
Doug Schenkel: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to go back to Tycho’s first question on capacity build out. How do you balance the desire to fulfill acute RX and vaccine development demand related to the pandemic with the outlook for post-pandemic demand? I mean, I guess to be more to the point, do you believe the capacity you are building today will continue to be used even post-pandemic and thus, should we view the elevated revenue levels associated with your build out as being durable even after the surge in pandemic-related demand subsides? And I guess well on this topic along those same lines, you are placing a lot of GeneXperts today. They are going to be used for the foreseeable future as much as people can get those, at least in our opinion just given what’s going on. But post-pandemic, how do you think about the durability of these placements and the associated revenue potential?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Doug. What I would like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you – to hear how we think about the long-term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looked like pre-vaccine or pre-COVID, call it. And let me start with our base business, through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments, have already been transitioning to a higher growth and earnings profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so, we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre-COVID where we were already a 5% to 6% grower. And to your point, it’s included in that with Cepheid growing at low-double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point we didn’t even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking, as we were diligencing and going to close that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. So, as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. But then also to your point, Cepheid, it might be back to low-double-digit and it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020, with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace. Because we are at the point of care, because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID, we really see this point of care positioning as unique. And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020, we really see this as a long-term improvement. Then you add to that Cytiva, which we are seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration process chromatography and many more things, that we are getting so many add backs with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccine that will ultimately receive approval. And so, we think that that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative, and that for the long-term we really can think high single-digit there as well. Then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy which is biased toward M&A. You add that on top here. And we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile. Now, there’s lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks, think of government spending, taxes, there are a number of variables here. So, it’s a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward.
Doug Schenkel: Super helpful. And then just one more quick follow-up on, I think, it was one of Derik’s questions. Just keeping in mind how strong your business has been this year, it seems pretty clear that you are going to be in a position to get your debt-to-EBITDA ratio down in the neighborhood of 3x by the end of this year. You referenced M&A here in answering my last question. How ready is the organization for M&A given everything that’s going on? But – the balance sheet is clean, but there is just a ton of demand on your infrastructure. So, I am just wondering how you would characterize your M&A readiness right now? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: It’s a great question. First of all, speaking to the balance sheet, I think you are in the right neighborhood there, that those are numbers that we could confirm based on the free cash flow and the EBITDA that we see in our current debt profile, that our balance sheet is in a very good position. I would also say, we couldn’t be more pleased with the progress that we are making in the transition of the GE Biopharma business, now Cytiva, into Danaher, and they are firing on all cylinders and we continue to extricate ourselves there from the transition services that GE provides us and standing up this organization and see just extraordinary, not only efforts but real results there. So, we always, at Danaher, maintain leadership and management capacity to ensure that the opportunities that we generate, that the market provides us, we can take advantage of. And so, while we are transitioning Cytiva into Danaher and nearly complete with that, that doesn’t keep us from being ambidextrous here and keeping our eye and being able to take advantages – take advantage of the opportunities that market provides.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, great. Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter here. Rainer, maybe a question on our Cytiva, no surprise, but if I look at how the Q played out, so Cytiva was 500 basis points of contribution in 3Q and I am looking at the order trends which is accelerating. Maybe talk about the Q4 guidance here, which implies a modest step down here for Cytiva. Is that a timing element or perhaps flesh out why contribution perhaps steps down in the context of accelerating orders?
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Vijay, and good to hear you. So, Q4 Cytiva, perhaps it’s helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It’s really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we had three working days less, and particularly for the consumer-oriented businesses that’s been impactful in the calculation. And having said that, if you think about the bioprocess industry today, already these companies are producing vaccines. So, if you think about operation work speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the biopharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they are already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see – vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government. And so, there’s a great deal of aggressiveness there. And so, that’s already happening here at the back end of Q3 and you will see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we are hopeful that that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well.
Matt McGrew: Vijay, maybe just as a kind of some context around it, I mean, we have talked about sort of year-to-date we have got north of $1 billion of COVID orders between Cytiva and Pall Biotech. The way to think about that is that those are orders that we have already gotten, that are booked, probably 50% of those orders are going to ship here in 2020, but the rest are going to move to 2021. Just to give you some idea of sort of how that order book is played out and it’s going to move its way through the P&L, like Rainer was just talking about.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Matt. Rainer, one more follow-up on that, you spoke about the order book. As vaccine manufacturing ramps up, do you need to make incremental investments? And I am just thinking about incremental margins here. It’s been really strong the last two quarters, mid-40s, well above historical trends. How should we be thinking about spend levels and incremental margins? Because I am assuming travel steps up as the economy reopens. Thank you.
Rainer Blair: Yes. So, Vijay, I will start here and then I will pass it on to Matt. So, first of all, we absolutely are and continue to invest in capacity expansions. In fact, we were in the capacity expansion program at Cytiva as we brought the company into the Danaher fold and are, of course, accelerating that. And you can expect additional investments here in Q4, that are capacity related certainly but also related to standing up the organization. And then as we continue to go into 2021, you will see continued investment, and of course that has – that plays out in our margin assumptions as well. And I think, Matt, you were just about to jump in on that.
Matt McGrew: Yes, I think for Q4, I think you are right, Vijay. We have seen sort of Q2, Q3, we have had really good fall through on the growth. I think as we sort of look at Q4 though, I think probably a 30% to 35% fall through is a better number to use. Like you said, we kind of, as we look at where that’s come from in Q2 and Q3, and we have had some really, really good mix, on where the growth’s come from Pall Biotech, think about Cytiva and Cepheid. And now that some of the other businesses are contributing more, I think we are going to have a bit of a mix impact. And then as you mentioned, the lower OpEx and less travel and trade show is certainly a part of it. Things are sort of getting going again as you saw with the growth rates. And then, Rainer talked about the accelerated growth spend we are going to do that in Q4. We have got some projects already that we have got underway. I think that will have an impact on it. And probably lastly frankly, we are – given where we have seen some of the growth and we have got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, on around bonuses and things like that. It will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us. So I think it probably moderates a little bit here, as we get into Q4 from where we have been, but still feel even with that, I still think we are going to be able to put up some pretty good EPS growth here.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful context. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.
Dan Brennan: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I know you just kind of outlined the $500 million plus or so for the vaccine opportunity or therapeutics for your biologics business, I am just wondering if you can kind of raise the scope up a little bit higher and just help us think through ultimately like the addressable opportunity for Cytiva and Pall just given the magnitude of therapeutic and vaccine development that’s ongoing. So, it’s nice that you got the orders in hand, but kind of how big is the market you feel that you are addressing as we look out for both vaccines and therapeutics related to COVID?
Rainer Blair: Dan, that’s a great question. And let me refrain just a little bit and give a little bit of background on this topic. It’s so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still makes very solid and defined projections, pretty challenging. You know there is a lot of questions around which kinds of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved and we have seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given, these are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA and there are number of wildcards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So, it’s really important to understand that prior to approval, picking what are the future “winners” is very difficult. The other thing that’s also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they are produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production. We also have a lot of questions around the number of doses. Is it going to be a one-time shot with a booster for life or is it going to be much like we see for influenza, an annual type injection that everybody needs, these are big questions that of course affect any kind of estimates that you make. And then lastly, there is a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. So, we see that – we see that it’s very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps quarter or so, we will start seeing approvals were very helpful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know about doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing. And then I come back to what Matt said, if you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval, so we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so, but again coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers, it’s tough.
Matt McGrew: Well, and remember too, Dan, that, that 1 billion is for orders that we have got today as of the end of the third quarter. So while Rainer sort of talking about you guys are talking about what’s the opportunity as we go forward sort of longer term, anything that we have here in the short-term in Q4 from an order perspective, we will just keep adding to it. So sort of the near-term, I think we still have some upside here as we get kind of into Q4 and then as the vaccines get approved and then as we start to learn some of these unknown variables that we can start to give you guys a bit better kind of view of it. But so far, I think it gives you a frame of what we have got. We have got the Q4 how that plays out. And then as we know more, I think as we get into early next year, we will probably have a better frame for you hopefully to get some clarity on that.
Dan Brennan: Great, thank you. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one more on Cepheid, I know you have kind of addressed it a couple of times, but I think there is similarly a moving target to figure out how testing evolves, particularly related to COVID as we get into 2021 with a vaccine and as potentially, there is a lot more testing done as point-of-care and you know the kind of the rapid antigens and much cheaper faster alternatives. So anyway, to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look out to ‘21 under some of those scenarios, because I think you are in the interesting position where you are not the kind of batch-based [indiscernible] kind of sitting between two different areas. So any color on that would be great?
Matt McGrew: Yes. Sorry, go ahead, Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Yes. I was just going to say that, Dan this is a really critical question, right. Lot of people talk about the antigen tests and most of those are used in different care settings are the Cepheid solution, GeneXpert that is used at the point of care in critical care environments and in the hospital when speed, workflow and accuracy really count. So, those clinicians on the basis of that test are going to make a call as to what therapy they prescribe. So, it has to be right, it just has to be right. And so that’s why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that’s why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect independent of the number of infections that we see other types of modalities really breathing either higher or lower depending on the infection rates. But as you think about the point-of-care hospitals, in particular and other point-of-care settings, that’s what we see this gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test to have an extraordinary amount of durability. And we see that right and you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 to 7 in the fourth quarter, 8 million and you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid, GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that is the fact that we have increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position and that installed base continues to grow.
Dan Brennan: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.
Rainer Blair: Hi, Steve.
Steve Beuchaw: Hi, good morning. I am not going to ask about COVID testing or bioprocess just to be clear. I was going to ask one on China and one on Beck Dx, I will just ask both here and then jump back in queue. One is I wonder if you can put more granularity on the growth in China, how it progressed through the quarter and any areas of comparative strength and weakness of acknowledging of course that it’s all recovering right here, it would be helpful just to get that regional perspective and to the extent you are comfortable talking about where that might sit in 4Q? And then I will go ahead and ask my second question, which was actually on Beck Dx, which we generally touched on here in the Q&A. I wonder if you could talk about the capital side, what your expectations are given DxA is now available in some regions I believe how you think about capital in Beck Dx prospectively? And then to the extent you have a window on it given that you have that business in the broader diagnostics platform, how are you planning for, for the fourth quarter and next year, as it relates to some of the specialty testing categories that are so important in hospital settings both for this business and then for just getting folks back into the hospital to get the kind of care they need, whether it’s related to cardiovascular or other specialty settings and I will apologize now for the very longwinded two questions and get back in queue? Thank you.
Rainer Blair: No worries. Thanks, Steve. Well, let’s start with China. China has been an extraordinary story as you all know in terms of the speed of the recovery and what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So, not only do we see of course extraordinary return to lab capacity, which are nearly or at a pre-pandemic level, we also see the return of patient volumes and to some degree approaching normality. And what’s unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So, the recovery in China in contrast to North America and Western Europe is broader based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have industrial businesses we have with Pall, we are seeing very nice recovery there. And like we said, in China we saw, essentially, 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well, as that economy continues to build momentum. And that’s really across the portfolio. Now, as we think about Beckman Diagnostics and our business there, we’re really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectation, and the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. So, we have a great deal of momentum here and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly. And as we think of capital, we’re starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placement. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so, those conversations are starting to happen. Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor, as we see COVID hotspots continue to pop around – pop up around the world, is that for now we haven’t seen anything that on the margin impacted in the patient volume return; meaning, that we see wellness testing and elective type procedures continuing to ramp and not be significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots, so cautiously optimistic here that the progression that we have seen for Beckman Diagnostics and more generally with patient volumes, continues to move forward positively.
Steve Beuchaw: Thanks for the perspective there and welcome to the call here, Rainer.
Rainer Blair: Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it.
Operator: We have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Crystal and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are around all day for questions.
Rainer Blair: Thanks everybody. Stay safe and healthy.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Maria and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today’s call, our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 6, 2020. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the second quarter of 2020 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are only available in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher’s overall core revenue growth profile, we are presenting core revenue on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. References to core revenue growth, including Cytiva sales and the calculation of period-to-period sales growth compare to the current period of Cytiva sales to the historical period Cytiva sales prior to the acquisition. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation, and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team’s commitment to the Danaher business system and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today. We are tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable, long-term value for shareholders for many years to come. Before we run through our second quarter results, I would like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future. Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of the global community’s attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19 and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular tests for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid’s test performance is best-in-class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. As a testament to Cepheid’s commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments are very different. So, the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter ahead of the upcoming flu season. In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double-digits and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid’s install base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world. Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter Diagnostics serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begins to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world’s ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. As we look beyond testing, a global race designed to find effective treatments for COVID-19 and we are proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva’s products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bio-processing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster. In addition to our market leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva’s innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall’s process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster and in one instance accomplishing in just a few weeks would typically take months or even years. These innovative bio-processing solutions are just a few examples of how we are helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure. Now, let’s look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion of sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter just under 10%, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid single-digits led by North America and Western Europe. High growth markets were up slightly driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single-digits year-over-year. Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both growth and operating profit margins increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points driven by slightly lower volume, excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow combined with a strong balance sheet positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment. We are also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19. Now, let’s take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8% led by high-teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations. Demand for our bio-processing, genomic and automation solutions, was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatments. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. And despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marked SCIEX’s most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we are continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 2.5%, with 5% core revenue growth led by continued strength at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid’s COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter further expanding Radiometer’s market leading global installed base. This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness business visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. At our water quality platform, mid single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial and market softness, while municipalities remained stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region. Core revenue at our product identification platform was down double-digits largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well – as well as we continued to support customers throughout the pandemic helping to keep their essential business operations up and running. So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let’s take a closer look at recent trends across our end-markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough with modest improvement as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed with many states only recently beginning phased re-openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19 related research and development, among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers, is generating strong demand for our bio-processing genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID related bio-processing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprised the majority of our exposure to the bio-processing end markets. And collectively, these two businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer term opportunities we are seeing here. Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID related research lab activities. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen, but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S., while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building. Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings. In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remains solid as customers sustain essential business operations, like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate and we are encouraged by recent order book trends. In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid to high single-digit quarter revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19 related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit – low double-digits, Diagnostics up high single-digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat. So to wrap up, we are proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We are excited about the portfolio that we have today and how it will continue to differentiate us going forward. And we are fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely positioned Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future. With that, Matt, I will turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Maria, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hey, I got a couple to start with. I think the first one is, can you – we are getting a number of questions on the margin math for the second quarter and the inventory step-ups. Can you talk about the dynamics of that? And the better – the more important questions like, how did the gross and operating margins progress now that Cytiva is fully into the numbers and how should we think about the rest of the year?
Tom Joyce: Yes, sure, Derek. I will take it. So the gross margin, we saw kind of a decline of 200 basis points sort of year-over-year. Like Tom said in the prepared remarks, that is entirely driven by inventory step-ups related to the Cytiva acquisition in the quarter. So, if you exclude that impact, our gross margins are, I call it, closer to 58%, which would have been up a couple of 100 basis points year-over-year and again, I think largely driven by Cytiva. And that should be sort of one-time here in the quarter, Derek, that we get by as we start to move. That’s a one time thing here in the quarter. So going forward, you shouldn’t see that.
Derik De Bruin: Okay, that’s – yes, I just want to clarify that and how should we sort of – and how should we think about the SG&A and the R&D the OpEx lines?
Matt McGrew: I don’t know that we had tremendous amount of kind of step-up issues in either of those two lines. I think about the R&D line, I think while I do think we will continue kind of invest in accelerate some spend here in the second half, I think more or less, the R&D line should stay pretty constant, again, outside of the investments that, that we are going to make here in the second half, largely around Cytiva. I think we are probably a little bit heavier investing there. But generally speaking, I think we are biased here in this environment to continue to try and spend to make sure that we position ourselves not only for where we are in the short-term here in ‘20, but to make sure that as we head into 2021 that we are in the best position possible. So might be how I think about it going forward.
Derik De Bruin: Great.
Tom Joyce: Yes. I would I would add to that, Derik, just echoing Matt’s comments, we are obviously very fortunate to have a portfolio that now includes businesses like Cytiva, Pall Biotech obviously, Cepheid, driving outside performance and with outstanding operating margins. And I think you know our track record historically is, we like to take advantage of situations like this to continue to invest for the future. And some of that investment shows up in the sales line, some in the marketing line and certainly some in the R&D line. And I think you will see us continue to try to do that, because we feel well-positioned in our markets and we think that there are selective opportunities to continue to invest with growth and that will set us up exceptionally well, not only for rest of this year, but most importantly, I think for next year as we see the environment improve.
Derik De Bruin: Great. If I can squeeze in one diagnostics question, you mentioned the 4-in-1 test coming out, it’s like how are you pricing that multiplex test? And also just talk about Cepheid capacity expansions, I mean, you have obviously picked it up since you – since March, but how should we think about where your cartridge development year can go or your production can go over the next couple of quarters?
Matt McGrew: Sure. Well, we are not yet at a point where we are in a position to talk about pricing on the 4-in-1 test. But certainly, this is a test that is going to be incredibly important in the market. We are going to continue to produce standalone tests as well, but there is no question our customers have expressed very strong interest in a targeted respiratory panel that brings together COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. So we will be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and be coming back with that. So, we think there is a tremendous opportunity there. Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You will recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests. And we are going to – we have released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity, some of that capital that we have released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We will see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021. I think key to this, Derik is our view that there is a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables, there is plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there is no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So, we are going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Derik.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Tom on the COVID tailwinds, you noted 3Q [Technical Difficulty] comment on Cepheid, how much of the volume do you expect to go to 4-in-1 versus standalone COVID testing going forward?
Tom Joyce: Tycho, I am assuming you can hear me clearly, we couldn’t hear anything on your question on, unfortunately, just except for the very last part of the question around 4-in-1. So, I am going to try the 4-in-1 answer and then we will see if you come through clearer.
Tycho Peterson: Okay.
Tom Joyce: So, I think your question was how much volume is going to move to the 4-in-1? We do not know the answer to that at this point. It’s we believe it will be significant and material, but in terms of putting a number on it quite yet, we just don’t have enough voice of customer yet. Obviously, we haven’t developed the pricing model yet and we are building capacity. So, we will have to come back to you probably in the next couple of months with a better sense of how we see that volume ramping. Again, we will continue to produce the standalone test so there will be a balance there. Time will tell on the overall volume. So, let’s try the earlier part of your question again.
Tycho Peterson: Yes. It’s just [Technical Difficulty] vaccine and therapy work, why shouldn’t you see a more material COVID tailwind in 3Q?
Tom Joyce: Okay. We only caught – we really apologize, we only caught the tail end of that. I am looking at my team on video and they can’t – they couldn’t hear that either. But let me just try to – let me try to hit it a bit, because I think you asked about vaccines…
Tycho Peterson: Why wouldn’t a 3Q tailwind be more material than 2Q for COVID?
Tom Joyce: Why? Let me see if I got that. You were asking about the Q3 tailwind?
Tycho Peterson: For COVID.
Tom Joyce: Okay, got it.
Tycho Peterson: Why is that more material given how much you have grown the Cepheid installed base and you have got Cytiva and Pall, why wouldn’t it be more material in 3Q versus 2Q?
Tom Joyce: Sure, sure. Absolutely. Sorry. I apologize that the transmission was so poor, but I think we got it now. We are going to see that volume continue to track. I think there was an outsized impact, certainly at Cepheid during the course of the second quarter with that instrument volume boosting at the rate that it did. We don’t expect that, that necessarily will continue to grow quite at that rate. So, I think that’s one mitigating factor. And I think as it relates to both Pall Biotech and Cytiva, I think we will see continued traction there. But at the moment, we think that what we are seeing from customers is a demand that is again given the quick ramp that was associated with the 200 or so vaccine and therapeutic-related efforts that are going on that those are likely to be more consistent in the third quarter rather than differentially higher. So, those are just some of the factors that perhaps that’s a little bit conservative. If so, we will take that, but in line, that’s our best estimate at the moment.
Tycho Peterson: And then Tom, can you put in the – go ahead, Matt.
Matt McGrew: Yes. No, I just wanted to kind of get out. We are expecting – from a tailwind perspective, we are expecting a modestly higher benefit here in the quarter for everything Tom talked about sort of more or less the same volumes at Cepheid, but with a bit of a tailwind or a headwind here on the instrument side. But I mean, I think if you think about what we are going to be doing here in the fourth quarter and into ‘21, particularly around the build-out on Cytiva and if you think about our tailwinds build on the Cytiva – sorry build on the Cepheid capacity that’s coming online. And then probably as importantly, we had 40% growth in orders at both Cytiva and Pall Biotech here in the quarter. And while we don’t expect all of that to show up here in Q3, that does portend well for what we think the second half will sort of look like and as we head into ‘21 and that was not just on vaccines, but that was sort of kind of evenly split between vaccines and the therapeutics, which you know are a big part too. So, while we may have a more modest expectation for the third quarter, I think that there is a ramp as we head through the second half and then particularly into ‘21.
Tycho Peterson: And then lastly, is there any color you can put on the vaccine and therapy work for Pall and Cytiva, I mean, you are not doing fill/finish work. So, there is no kind of per dose calculation, but could you just help us think about the magnitude of that work?
Tom Joyce: There are. Gosh, I mean, we are certainly working on that and given our exposure across the broad range of human clinical trials that are going on right now. We are starting to get a handle on those opportunities, but there are still so many unknowns to make sizing it tough. I mean, it’s the number and different types of winning vaccines and therapeutics, questions about production volumes, number of steps in each process. So, I mean, there is no question that it’s going to be a large and sustained opportunity, but it’s just – it’s just become – it’s a very hard number for us to wrap our minds around today. But I am sure we will get a handle on it as it becomes clearer who the winners are and how that production volume will ramp within any individual winner. We are not going to have dozens and dozens of winners here. I think we will have several winners and once we have more line of sight to where the winners are then obviously we can get a better sense of their dosage production volumes, our position there and what that means when you translate that into a sales volume.
Tycho Peterson: Alright. Thanks, guys. Sorry about the quality issues before.
Tom Joyce: Yes, sorry Tycho. Thanks, though.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid execution through. Maybe I will start with Cytiva, 40% order growth, the implication of that is – I mean, if that business is contributing about 400 basis points of growth right now and the order book is running 2x that of the growth rates right now. The implication is that business should contribute 400 to 500 basis points of growth in fiscal ‘21 if assuming all of the orders that we are seeing flow-through get recognized as revenues in fiscal ‘21? Does it make sense?
Matt McGrew: Yes, I mean, I think it’s – this is Matt. I mean, I think the issue with that – the math can make sense, but it’s the assumption around the timing, I think that we just are still kind of TBD on, Vijay, whether that starts to flow real hard here in the third or fourth quarter or if it starts in the first half of ‘21. I think that’s the only question that’s really around the timing. But like I said, earlier with my comments, I mean, I think we are pretty encouraged by the start of Cytiva both on top line, the core business outside of COVID and the COVID opportunity that’s starting to emerge that you saw with that level of orders growth.
Vijay Kumar: And just on the margin itself, Matt, I mean, if you look at I think the deal model had Cytiva running at mid-30s. It looks like it came in well above 40%. Is that – is there any timing element on those margins or how sustainable is the Cytiva on the margin side?
Matt McGrew: Yes, sure. Cytiva margins did come in north of 40 in Q2, which is obviously, like you said better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there is three things to think about on the reason for that. One, you know, we had higher volume here north of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from the fall-through perspective from a VCM perspective. So, we did have higher volumes. The other thing – the second thing is there is probably a very favorable mix element here. We had sort of the higher margin businesses like process chromatography grew double-digits, while more of the equipment heavy businesses will call it low single-digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter. And the third thing is and I think you’ve seen it a lot of places, we just have a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right, travel, trade shows, etcetera, was sort of much lower. So I think if you add it all up, that’s how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40, but I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin, think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 was sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way, but there is two things that I think to think about as we head forward into Q3 in the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses, we alluded to that earlier in the call. But in particular, this business one, given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bio-processing and frankly the business we have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past and we are very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity affording to them. So that’s one. And then two, we are 90 days into this from a kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our standup costs, the number of people we have hired, the cost that we put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus that is going to ramp as we go through the second half. And that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well. So good, good start for sure, little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm. But I do think there is some moderation coming.
Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Matt. And one big picture for Tom. Tom, if you look at the balance sheet, $5 plus billion of cash in hand, free cash looks like we are run-rating well above $5 billion. I am just curious I think at the time of second week, you guys made comments about the ways being opportunistic? I am just curious how your thoughts on cap deployment are evolving in the current environment? Thanks, guys.
Tom Joyce: Sure, Vijay. Thank you. Yes, we are in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet and that position continues to be reinforced by really exceptional free cash flow, a $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot. When I talk about opportunistic, that’s a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we are coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter and that sometimes creates opportunities that for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming, businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden, they have a change of heart about their future and we are able to take advantage of that. But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see is continuing strength net free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year and that goes across each one of our platforms, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, water quality and PID, each of them continuing to focus on key market segments, where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities, where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and in some cases bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers everyday. And so I think we are in a great position. We are starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter. One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics in the second quarter, that was a deal that was essentially put on hold earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up. But as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and we are able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that’s a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform. And we are looking forward to do that team playing significant roles. That’s just one example. But I would say we are generally seeing an improving environment one that we can not only be opportunistic, but I think, continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time.
Vijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Is this the author? Is this the author?
Scott Davis: Well, no comment. I should have done it under a pseudonym, I guess that are anonymous. I’d get less hate mail.
Tom Joyce: I have gotten through the – I have gotten through the introduction. I didn’t get directly to the Danaher chapter, but thank you. Welcome, Scott. Good morning.
Scott Davis: Well, thanks, Tom. It’s very kind. But hopefully the book helps you sleep at night, couple of pages, and you are out like a light, but anyways, I – lot of good detail already and you just talked a little bit about M&A and what do you envision Tom in the next kind of 12 months, I mean, this is a strange environment. Is it a better environment for bolt-ons? Is it better environment to take bigger bets like you did with Cytiva? Is it – I mean, just a little bit of color around that just given how strange things are right now?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Well, first of all, Scott, I think over the next 12 months, I think we will see without any question an improving environment from an M&A and capital deployment perspective. I mean, we all know that, March, April, I mean, things were essentially locked down in to great extent people were frozen in place in many different ways. And so there is no doubt that you come off of a situation like that. And I think we will see improvement. We are already seeing a little bit of that already. I would say normally what happens particularly on the back of a very large acquisition, like Cytiva that we have done, you have historically seen us do more, small, mid-size bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally, on the back of a big deal, we tend to do a few smaller deals. Now, all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we are in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow certainly that Cytiva has helped with. So, in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach. I mean, obviously, Cytiva was outsized, but I think we can be pretty balanced in terms of taking advantage of an improving environment.
Matt McGrew: And Scott, it’s Matt. Maybe put some numbers to the context of what Tom just talked about, we have got pro forma EBITDA, this year, that’s going to be close to $6 billion. And as of right now, we are less than 3x net debt to EBITDA. So to Tom’s point, we have got some flexibility to be aggressive with larger or the smaller stuff.
Scott Davis: Yes, for sure. So, natural follow-on just again, in the context of this is kind of a strange environment and you have got amazing growth rates in so many of your businesses, how do you integrate Cytiva for the long-term, I mean, in this environment. And I mean, really specifically, bringing in DBS tools and really culturally, I mean, bringing the best of the Danaher culture kind of into that organization even obviously talk about standing it up as kind of a decentralized business, but how do you do it and is it at all delayed at all? And you don’t want to kind of disrupt the business flow right now given how high the growth rates are or is it already begun and you are really, it’s similar playbook is maybe your past acquisitions?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Scott, we have had to – we have certainly had to be creative in this environment. And I think we have been able to do that, I will describe what I mean by that here in a minute, but obviously with the restrictions on travel and being and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we have had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objectives in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start. So, I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year to regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We have gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment, because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. Add to that the fact that the team reports indirectly to Rainer. Rainer will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he has maintained that relationship and continued to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So, we have gone through what we call ECO. You have heard of that before executive champion orientation, a lot of that very familiar to that, that team because they are well down field in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. So, yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that, that business and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So, net-net, the combination of using virtual, our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business. We can safely say right now, we are very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face to face environment. 
Scott Davis: Okay, good. Thanks. Congrats, Tom, congrats, Matt and good luck for the rest of the year.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Scott.
Matt McGrew: Thank you, Scott.
Scott Davis: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Starting with another one on Cytiva, your growth, even excluding COVID-19 was definitely a bit above your deal model assumptions of course, the role you are playing in advancing COVID Solutions helps the growth profile as well it is early but I am curious how these trends impact your view on Cytiva accretion and returns longer term, especially given the early and pronounced non COVID strength?
Tom Joyce: Well, Doug, I will start with the top line and then Matt will jump in with how we see that that flowing through when you are accurate, it they are off to a start that is better than what we anticipated in the growth model. You heard us talk to numbers that were in the in the 10% range. And that core growth in 2019, if you go back to that was about in that range. And yet as we came into this year, they came in with a strong order book, good backlog, and then you had the COVID impact on top of that and so when you then kind of separate that you see there what you might say there non-COVID base business growth being in the mid-teens and the COVID volume obviously taking that volume growth over 20%. So, I think the key message there is this is a business as a base business put COVID aside for a second that is off to a phenomenal start that continues to lead in its market and is continuing to build the order book day in and day out.
Doug Schenkel: That’s helpful. It’s actually a good second question. In your remarks, you have commented on Cytiva and the Pall Biotech order book, your order book looks like for capital equipment. It’s like the recent [Technical Difficulty] of airtime in the Q&A today but it’s clearly better than expected [Technical Difficulty] end market, some momentum building in academic research, but in both categories, it seems like consumable and service were well equipped for them. So the reason I am asking about the broader order book and answer it however you want, of course, but I am just wondering if you think there is pent up capital demand heading into the second half and if there is evidence that this could start to turn into revenue over the course of the year?
Tom Joyce: So Doug, there was a part of that question. Early on that we did not catch. It broke up, but I think we definitely caught the back end of your question. So I am going to hit that assuming we didn’t miss anything at the front end, which was really around you are talking about consumables and service versus equipment in my prepared remarks, and you were asking about pent up capital demand. And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent up capital demand in a number of different areas. I might site one example if I turned to our Environmental applied solutions business segment and I look at a Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, we have seen much more weakness in our in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that equipment has a lifecycle and requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment, as consumer packaged goods, volumes have grown. And so I would, very much expect to see that fuse one example that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order, I think ditto on as labs reopen in the life science market. We are going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we have dialed some of that improvement in even the third quarter as we start to see labs reopening we are going to see some of those orders that would have normally flowed through in the first and second quarter come through in the third.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. 
Matt McGrew: Yes, Doug, this is again – Doug it’s Matt again. I started just kind of put some maybe some numbers in context to the overview Tom gave. I mean, you saw here in Q2 our order book grew nearly 10% from an order perspective. So, that’s – it’s an encouraging sign to what Tom just talked to and we have got the core business, if you will, without the Cytiva – or sorry without the COVID tailwinds was down kind of 3% here in the quarter. And as Tom just mentioned at the end, we are sort of anticipating because of that nearly 10% order growth, I think you will see an improvement of that, minus 3% sort of going to flat here in the quarter.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, that’s super helpful. I will try to sneak in one last one just a clean up question, hopefully you can hear me okay now. In the second quarter, you delivered adjusted earnings growth that was 70% or so higher than reported revenue growth, is it fair to think that it’s going to be lower than that in Q3 as the mix starts to evolve a bit more towards capital and as you are ramping some of the opportunistic investment you described earlier in this call?
Tom Joyce: Yes. I mean, maybe the way to think about kind of the third quarter and VCM, etcetera. I mean, it is a little tricky. I think you do need to sort of look at the core business that is, Danaher ex-Cytiva, maybe the way that I think about it is that from a fall through perspective, that Danaher non-Cytiva piece is probably going to have a 30% to 35% variable margin on it fall-through if you will as we do make some of the investments we have talked about in Cytiva and elsewhere. I think if you then include the assumptions around Cytiva, put those in, I think that sort of gets you from an EPS perspective sort of south of where we were here in Q2, but probably closer to what I think we are going to end up with.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you again.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.
Steve Beuchaw: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time here.
Tom Joyce: Good morning.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay. Hoping you could just put a little bit of perspective on in terms of the recovery trajectory and then I had one less exciting model question. There are two things that we have focused on the call here where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines, in the vaccine space, while it’s certainly tough to know exactly how it’s going to look and how big it’s going to be. It would be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we are at ex today which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to ‘21, is it still X or is it X x2 or X x3? What does that look like? And then the other ramp related question I was going to ask actually relates to healthcare utilization. So, Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting healthcare to some extent in doc office settings to some extent in hospitals, that’s encouraging, should we take this to mean you feel good about this sort of dovetails off of Doug’s question, but the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck DX and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q or given everything that’s going on the hospitals to take a little bit longer? Thanks so much.
Tom Joyce: Yes, you bet. So, your broader question started out with recovery trajectory and I want to just hit one quick theme and then I am going to get your question about vaccines. One of the key things we haven’t really touched on this call, even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across Life Sciences and Diagnostics and not just across, Cytiva and Pall, but – or Cepheid, but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we are seeing broadly there and across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that’s – I think that’s an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven’t really touched on today, but let me get to the core of your questions. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again, yes, you are right. It is, as I said earlier, very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean, you are talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. I mean, today, all of these – all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase 1, Phase 2, early stage human trials, small volumes etcetera. I mean, we are nowhere near the stage of talking about tens, let alone hundreds of millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so, again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it’s certainly a high multiple of where we are today, but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is. Relative to your question about healthcare utilization, I think the simple answer is yes, we will be seeing an improvement in the hardware equipment side of the house and yes, it is associated with Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems…
Steve Beuchaw: Brief musical interlude.
Tom Joyce: Brief musical interlude maybe that was associated with the recovery in healthcare utilization, but the issue has been not just around healthcare utilization relative to equipment, but it’s really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area whether it’s the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not in certain cases, zero. And so just as we are seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we have started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that’s in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen, because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we will start to see that return to a more normal growth rate.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay, that’s incredibly helpful. I know we are top of the hour here. So I will take my financial question offline. Really appreciate all that.
Tom Joyce: Okay. Thanks so much.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks everyone for joining us today on our call. We are around all day for questions.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: My name is Chrystal, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, please go ahead.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Chrystal. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 21, 2020. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the first quarter of 2020, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile starting with second quarter of 2020, we intend to present core revenue growth on a basis that includes Cytiva as if the business had been owned for the current period and the comparable prior year period. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts. Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is, we felt we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. Before we run through our first quarter results, I will highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition. At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength, with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses, but they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19. We're proud to support the frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19. IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the US, Cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. Since Cepheid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately two million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately six million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations. Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best-in-class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The market leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity, and in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high-sensitivity automated IgG serology test. The team plans to ramp production capability to more than two million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers. As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva our supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. Pall's Filtration Solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and ultimately a cure. Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end-market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis. Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter. So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high-single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high-single-digit declines in high-growth markets. Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions. Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. We generated $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position. Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5% with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high-single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses Leica Microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses Cepheid and Radiometer. Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particularly strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March. Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented healthcare challenge and beyond. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China, as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID -- were not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1% with 2.5% core revenue growth. In our water quality platform mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world, a mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter, as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures. Core revenue at our product identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses. At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases. So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis. So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work. Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs. In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed, as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe, trailing that of China. China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth including Cytiva to be in the range of flat to down 10%. So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion. Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last six as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business System create a strong foundation for continued outperformance. I have loved every day of the past three decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing talent. And I can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come. Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva to name just a few. There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders. So what's next for me? Well first off that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of MedStar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1st of this year and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Chrystal, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. 
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hey. So a couple of questions and then I'll congratulate you on the retirement, I'm jealous by the way. So to start off, so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the 2Q for COVID-related contributions? I mean, you're producing a lot of Cepheid tests, the serologies ramping. I guess, are all those tests going to be used what all was spoken for? I mean, I was just curious in terms of what do you think about utilization and sort of what's embedded into the guide? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Okay. Thanks Derik. Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid -- we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity, but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build. Radiometer also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. So I think overall you'd consider Cepheid Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems a bit that are more patient volume-dependent and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return. But certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID no doubt. So, now putting all that together you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. So, I think that's the way, I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2.
Matt McGrew: And Derik, it's Matt. I just want to make sure also you've kind of – we mentioned serology. We are not assuming anything here in the quarter for serology. Even though we're ramping up with Beckman and we're going to have some capacity here our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like. So that COVID tailwind does not include serology just to be clear.
Derik De Bruin: Great. That's really helpful. And I guess just one question on Cytiva. In general, did you see any stocking in the first quarter? And I'm just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the Cytiva stand-alone business for the second quarter?
Tom Joyce: Derik, we saw very little. It's always hard to tell when it's on the margins as to whether or not there was stocking going on there. Generally, we don't think it was particularly material. But I'd tell you Cytiva was off to a great start, as I mentioned 10% core growth in the first quarter really strong momentum in the core bioprocessing business and that's really driven by folks working on solutions to COVID-19. And, but as we look forward, I think we have really as you can imagine given we just closed the end of March 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here. But in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint given the limitations we have here on travel. So right now, we're going to focus on obviously a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year, once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks. Derik.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. Good morning. Tom I'll start with congrats on the transition. I think it might be helpful to hear from you why now is the right time? I know you plan these things out well in advance. But I think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of pandemic after closing your largest deals. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about how long this transition had been planned? And why now is the right time?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Absolutely, Tycho, I'd be happy to. I can honestly say that, you would have to go all the way back to my very first year in the role where we along with the Board made sure that, we talked about talent development, about ensuring that we are progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point, where we are today and had an outstanding choice in Rainer Blair to succeed me. So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last five or six years. We always want to do something like this, when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over. It was super important that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. I am really excited about Rainer and the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role and he's just going to do a fantastic job. So we all feel great about it.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks. And then for the follow-up just a question on some of the longer-term COVID-related tailwinds. For Cepheid there's presumed to be less rule-in rule-out flu testing tied to COVID going forward. So I'm curious how you think about that? And then how you think about durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market? For Beckman curious, if you can put anything around pricing for serology? And then lastly for Cytiva and Pall just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses on a multiyear basis? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short-term and the long-term. I think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective Cepheid's impact along with IDT Radiometer in terms of treatment on the frontline as well as Beckman and serology and IgG testing, I think, that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities. Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think -- as you know well, we are one of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge, obviously, with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid. Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture and so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have and god willing we will have both therapies as well as vaccines. In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think, the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven obviously with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology test, the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests as I think Matt said earlier wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. So I think a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time. In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. So I think a good spot to be in.
Tycho Peterson: Great. I appreciate it and congrats again on the retirement.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Vijay.
Vijay Kumar: Good morning, guys and Tom congrats on a well-earned rest. I think -- maybe starting with the leadership question here Tom. You mentioned Rainer not -- he's known to the Street, but perhaps not everyone knows him well. And you did mention that he was the right person. Maybe contrast your leadership style versus -- with Rainer's leadership style, what does Rainer bring here? And what should investors look forward to under this transition?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, I'd start Vijay with the fact that Rainer and I have worked together closely for virtually all of his 10 years. I don't know, if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher he came in initially as the President of Videojet. And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife Elaine had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX -- after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we had this outstanding leader who had just come into Videojet and the real need at SCIEX and Rainer repacked and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then, through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. And so, when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than I will. He's an outstanding individual, he is super smart. He is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher, as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled. So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher and I am supremely confident that that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful perspective, Tom. Just maybe one housekeeping question perhaps for Matt. Matt, I think, the press release had a couple of hundred basis points contribution from Cytiva. That perhaps implies double digits, maybe, even low teens growth in the business. I just want to make sure with the business doing 10%, I think, in Q1, continuing double digits in 2Q, is that just the business growth as usual? Or was there any contribution, perhaps from COVID-related business? And then, perhaps, also address the decremental margins here for 2Q? Thanks, guys.
Matt McGrew: Yes. Sure. So from Cytiva perspective, I mean, I think it grew 10% there in Q1. I think that's probably a reasonable place for the business to be here in the second quarter as well. So I think your math on that is pretty correct. As far as decremental margins go, I think the place that I'd start is probably about 40% decrementals. It can vary quite a bit depending on mix, et cetera. But I think starting with 40% is a good place to start. I will tell you that probably in Q2, in Diagnostics though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals and that's all related to FX. So that delta will be because of FX here in the quarter, so 40%, overall, maybe a touch higher here in Q2 in Diagnostics.
Vijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Vijay. 
Operator: We have reached the allotted time for questions. Your last question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats, Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Scott. Good morning.
Scott Davis: It's been a great six years. I'm a little surprised you're going, but I don't blame you. It's -- retirement sounds pretty interesting right now.
Tom Joyce: Scott, it was not informed by the current economic uncertainties. It was very much part of the plan.
Scott Davis: Yes. Sure. Sure, I believe that. Anyway, so I wish you the best. I know, we'll see you before you go, but anyway…
Tom Joyce: Thank you.
Scott Davis: A great run.
Tom Joyce: Thank you.
Scott Davis: With -- just switching to business what are the challenges of integrating Cytiva here in this kind of new world? I mean, can you really teach DBS and do Kaizens and all that stuff on a Zoom video?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. Yes, is the answer to that. Why do I -- why would that be the case, given how important being it -- we use that term, being at gemba, being in the real place, how important we talk about that being. Well, we actually kicked off DBS training what we call ECO, Executive Champion Orientation. We kicked that off virtually using Microsoft Teams just two weeks ago. I kicked it off, Rainer was on the call. John Sekowski, who you know from our DBS office, led the effort. We probably touched -- we got more people through that ECO over that day, day-and-a-half, I forgot the full duration, because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so -- a digital tool. And so, the answer is, we're working. We're doing our best. We're off to a good start. We've got to get creative. We've got to invent new ways to get things done. Interestingly, our existing businesses outside of Cytiva are in fact doing multi-day Kaizens using virtual tools, using Zoom using Microsoft Teams and it's not the same, it's different. We wouldn't use that as a standard going forward. We absolutely value being face-to-face. But we've challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's encouraging. Just switching gears I know there's been a lot of questions around Cepheid and Beckman as there should be. But if you go down to Environmental & Applied Solutions, you've got some interesting businesses at different cyclicalities and such. Is there kind of a range of outcomes in 2Q that we can start to think about for those businesses? I know you've made some encouraging comments on Videojet but -- and actually just Water too. But on an overall basis at least Tom, is there any color you can give on that?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Yes. Scott, these are fantastic businesses even in a challenging economic environment. I mean Hach's leadership position in Water Quality analytics four times to five times its nearest competitor; Videojet, a leader from a share perspective as well. Both obviously heavily skewed towards -- their balance of sales skewed towards consumables, north of 70%, 75% in those businesses being aftermarket consumables and service. When water quality testing has to be done every single day in municipalities around the world when consumer packaged goods have to be marked and shipped every single day around the world, those consumables continue to underpin reasonably steady performance. I mean they are a safety net under the revenue structures of those businesses. And while there'll be some other dimensions the -- like the equipment side in water quality for example or even in PID and some of the software businesses that will be a little bit more pressured here, I think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times. So, I wouldn't trade those businesses for any in their markets.
Scott Davis: I should ask it differently I guess. Should -- will this segment be down more than your corporate average, Tom?
Tom Joyce: Well, yes I mean I think they would be down a bit more only because they're not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at Cepheid and IDT as well as Radiometer and even with what we think is going to be pretty solid performance at Cytiva and Pall. So, yes, I think these businesses would be at the lower end of the core growth component. You could potentially see the segment EAS down potentially mid-to-high teens inside of the guide.
Scott Davis: Okay. Perfect. Thank you and congrats again Tom. Best of luck.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Scott. Good to hear from you today.
Matt Gugino: Chrystal, that concludes our questions. Do you want to get any final remarks? Well thanks everyone for joining us today. We're around all day for questions.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 07:30:00) =====

With that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continued to evolve into a higher growth company as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split-off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close had a very good 2019 as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the businesses performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. First, as part of the regulatory approval process we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected, as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe. When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. So, now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points. Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last two years. SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product line, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress, both operationally and commercially. Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process, to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers' research across a number of genomic application. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives, as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman, as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth rooms has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining, pathology imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products, like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new automated high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes, to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive fast-growing space. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3% with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate. At Videojet, core revenue was up low-single-digits but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. Finally turning to water quality, core revenue for the quarter increased at a low-single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low-single-digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single-digits for the quarter and full year. Hach has been a consistent mid-single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. At Trojan core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities. And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. So to wrap up, 2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5%, and reflects the impact of three additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint and as mentioned earlier does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christel, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Matt Gugino: Good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: Good morning. I'll start with Pall. For life sciences, you had previously baked in a slowdown for the fourth quarter. Obviously that didn't happen. So just curious, if you could talk a little bit about why you thought things might slow why they did not and I guess what's embedded in the guide for Pall Life Sciences going forward? And as we think about kind of capacity supply-demand dynamics and adding GE Biopharma into the portfolio, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the platform of business?
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Tycho. We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter double-digit core growth in the quarter that, I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall breaking it down into biotech and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT all combined to give us a tremendous amount of confidence both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. Now, we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the – into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. We don't really see any issues relative to what – as we've been asked about in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process. Relative to GE Biopharma that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure, specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think, it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio albeit as a separate standalone operating company distinct from Pall.
Matt McGrew: Hey, Tycho this is Matt. Just to kind of clarify. From a planning assumption perspective for biopharma for this year we're kind of thinking low double digits versus the mid-teens that we saw sort of last year. So just kind of clarify, where we think that will be here.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then one follow-up on China up high single digits, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded in guidance for China? And then obviously with coronavirus just curious how you're thinking about that as it relates to particularly for your diagnostics business over there.
Tom Joyce: Sure. It was overall a very good quarter in China Tycho up high single digits in the fourth quarter and that was across all four of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. Within life science, you know, as well as we do there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food and to some extent, the pharma market around four by seven that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61 terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the New Year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending, the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So, losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly, here in the first quarter. And could see some impact moving to second, but we continue to work to offset. So, we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance. But it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses by the way Tycho that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis both public and private, including the CDC to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days, a panel of two PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So, we are in the fight here, but the impact of this both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business. And any of our specific businesses it's just far too early to tell.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.
Tom Joyce: Hi Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hi.
Tom Joyce: Hey. Good morning.
Derik De Bruin: Hey, Could you sort of talk about the embedded margin assumptions for the business ex-GE right now as sort of what's embedded in the guide? Just sort of want to walk through now that dental is out what you're sort of thinking about the margin expansion and gross margin expansion would be in 2020.
Matt McGrew: Yeah. So kind of embedded – Derik, its Matt, kind of embedded in our guide here is sort of a 5% core growth which we talked about. And kind of -- the typical 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion on that is sort of how we get to the range $4.80 to $4.90.
Derik De Bruin: Great and the -- when GE comes into that, I mean it's going to -- obviously the margins are higher than that. Would you expect incremental boost to that immediately? I'm just sort of thinking about, sort of how it rolls through.
Matt McGrew: Well, I mean, it's going to roll through. And we talked about the initial accretion and kind of what we updated here today. So, that would have obviously included the fact that that is a higher-margin business than what we have. So, I think the way to think about that rolling through is it is in that $0.60. And then, as we go forward, we sort of talked about that as this being -- even though it's high-margin business. I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year. Higher-margin businesses tend to, kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion, at the highest highs then given the VCM and the fall-through they already have. So, I still think going forward using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion, even post-GE is the right way to think about it. And you'll capture the uplift in the margin, in that $0.60 if you will in 2020.
Derik De Bruin: Great, and just a quick follow-up to Tycho's question on, the China situation, have you embedded anything into your organic core growth guide for any sort of slowdown in the market at all?
Matt McGrew: At this point, we have not. We kind of -- as Tom said, it's -- we know as much as you guys know and we've sort of kind of -- if everything gets back to normal very quickly here it's still early enough that. We think we'd probably be able to offset that largely. So too early to tell and we have not put anything into either Q1, or the full year at this point.
Derik De Bruin: Great, thanks, I will get back in a queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on a nice print here. Thanks for taking the question, Tom, maybe one big picture question on the Biopharma, I think, the commentary on the assumptions around 2020 growth low-double digits that was helpful. In GE, that business has been running double digits in 2019. So I'm just curious your thoughts around the growth of the GE Biopharma assets. And not -- why 6% to 7% is still the right way to think about the outlook for that business?
Tom Joyce: Hey, thanks Vijay. I appreciate the question. You're right. We had an initial planning assumption of 6% to 7% for that business. As I mentioned, in my remarks, they performed better than that, here in 2019. We just need to get the business closed and we need to get in underneath the covers and really understand at a deeper level kind of the order rate trajectory ,the backlog and those kind of things to make sure that we're comfortable as we go through 2020 at rates higher than our original projection. So we're excited about getting inside and getting with the team and trying to understand those opportunities. Obviously, if we were closed in the business a year ago and had this visibility that we would normally get to 2019, we would have had a higher view, but we'll need a little time to get inside and see what 2020 ultimately might look like.
Vijay Kumar: That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick on the guidance. Margin execution shown in Q4 really strong. Was this because core revenues came in better with this volume-related leverage, or -- I'm just curious on what drove margin execution. And when you think about the context of three extra days in Q1, any assumptions on what the contribution is to the top line in Q1 from extra days? Thank you.
Matt McGrew: Sure. Maybe start with the second question first. So from -- I think, the three extra days in Q1 is probably worth -- it's sort of hard to tell. Its inexact science, but I think it's probably 50 to 100 basis points in Q1, would be probably what its worth. And then, kind of, talking to the Q4 fall through, I mean, gross margins were up 50 bps year-over-year, which was helpful. Price was okay here in the quarter. And the rest was good. It was kind of running the Danaher playbook. SG&A was down. Gross margins are up. And the volume coming through at 6% was a little bit better than we thought and that led to a pretty good finish here to the year with 100 basis points of margin expansion. And I think that's probably the way to think about it.
Vijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning.
Doug Schenkel: How does the favorable financing outcome -- we knew about, but you described very well in your prepared remarks, how does that impact your flexibility on capital deployment? Specifically, I'm really thinking about M&A, maybe more near-term than we might have thought a quarter or two ago. And related to that, based on your forecasts for free cash flow this year, it appears you can delever to about 3.5 times EBITDA by the end of 2020. Am I doing math the right way there?
Matt McGrew: I mean, it's going to be close to that, I suppose, have -- I mean, yes, I think that's probably a pretty good spot. As far -- I'm sorry, that's on the second question, the free cash flow. As far as any impact, I think, on your first question, does that change in a material way, the interest -- would change in a material way in the near term, I don't think it's going to have a big difference on what we -- how we think about M&A here in the near term. I think we've talked about, we're still going to be active and in the market for sure. We will probably be focusing more on some of the bolt-on activity in smaller deals. But also, like we've said, if something was of interest and strategically out there for us. We also have talked in the past that, if we had to issue equity, we would. So, I don't think the financing necessarily changes anything in the near-term here.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you for that. In your prepared remarks as well as in the press release, you called out market share gains as a driver of revenue growth. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe be a bit more specific on where this most -- this is most evident, based on what you're seeing recently. And how we should think about the sustainability of these share gains moving forward?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Absolutely. I'd be happy to, Doug. I'll pick a couple of examples, looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last three years at Beck LS. In the three years pre-acquisition, that business launched three new products. So we've 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line in flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the Vi-CELL products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which by the way was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. You know, if I look over at -- in the diagnostics -- a couple of businesses that again are clearly gaining share. You got to look at Cepheid as one really good example and menu expansion continues to be a part of that certainly the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs our integrated delivery networks has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and three point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer, but where the performance continues to be terrific I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have in fact displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. One last one maybe I'll turn over to water quality where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks, but a part of what's driven their cadence is they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last two years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel I think substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share.
Doug Schenkel: That’s great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.
Matt McGrew: Hi, Steve.
Steve Beuchaw: Good morning, and thanks for the time. Just a couple of easy ones here from me. One is as we go into 2020 and you've laid out the 5% core objective for the broader company pre-GE can you just speak to expectations for growth within the different businesses around that 5%?
Matt McGrew: Sure, Steve. I think maybe the simple kind of at a high level the way to think about it is that we're expecting life sciences and diagnostics both to be kind of in the 5% to 6% range, sort of, versus the high single digits that they were last year. And that EAS is kind of continues in call it the 3% to 4% range.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay. Great. Much appreciated. And then over the course of the year, I wonder if you could speak to a couple of points just within the non-op so we've got our models with many moving parts subsequent to the changes in the last several months and those still coming as tight as we can. I wonder if you could speak to how you would imagine corporate expense plays out over the course of the year relative to that 1Q starting point and maybe relative to 2019.
Matt McGrew: Yes.
Steve Beuchaw: And then I wonder if over the course of the year how you would imagine share count playing out. Of course there have been a lot of moving parts but is where we are for 1Q just a good benchmark for the full year? Thanks so much.
Matt McGrew: Yes. Yes. Sure. No. Lot of moving parts. We appreciate that. So corporate expense Steve I would probably think about $60 million to $65 million per quarter is a good place to start from a modeling perspective. And from a share count perspective in Q1 it's going to be call it 718 million, 719 million shares. I would model in, sort of, kind of our typical share creep of maybe 1 million to 2 million shares a year. And maybe for a full year that 718 million -- call it 720 million 721 million at the end, I think I'd ramp it that way.
Steve Beuchaw: Got it. Just all I needed. Thank you so much.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks, everyone.
Matt McGrew: Good morning. 
Dan Brennan: Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I was hoping to dig into a little bit on the diagnostic front. Beckman obviously a nice year in 2019. What do you see for 2020 there? Can you comment on some of the competitive launches? And in particular you mentioned a lot of the new product introductions there in hematology for Beckman. Kind of what's on the horizon for Beckman Diagnostics?
Tom Joyce: Sure, Dan. Thanks. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're really pleased with how Beckman performed – Beck Dx performed in 2019 at a mid-single-digit core growth. And as I think you know, well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were two years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage we believe in the – in higher volume environments and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think to an even more important level. You mentioned hematology. Hematology the DxH 900 with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series both big upgrades to that product line and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be, because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes. Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a five, seven, 10 year period. There have been – there certainly is – are one or two out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line. And I think some of the things, I've talked about already are what underpin that.
Dan Brennan: Great. And then maybe switching gears over to Pall bio process. Obviously, terrific growth there and you've commented earlier on some of the outlook earlier Tycho's question. I'm just wondering with regards to gene therapy obviously you have nice exposure there as well. But are there any opportunities to maybe expand the portfolio whether internally or externally to kind of capture the expected growth rate in gene therapy? Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, it's certainly early days as you know in gene and cell therapy, and there's a lot going on. And Pall is working very closely with a number of customers in that area. But given the nascent nature of those the development of those therapies right now, it will be a while. It will be measured in years before the impact of that may very well become sort of material to Pall in the aggregate. So, a very exciting space for us one that we think we're really well positioned to support, but one that will take a while to evolve.
Dan Brennan: Excellent. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question was – your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Tom Joyce: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, Tom. Great. Maybe just one on Cepheid. That's been as you kind of noted a 20% grower since the deal margins obviously moved significantly higher as well. How should we think about that asset going forward? I mean, it seems like there's still significant opportunities. You talked about the menu expansion areas like China, obviously still underpenetrated. I think you guys are still talking about kind of that low double-digit growth. Now that we've been three years here at 20%-plus, what's the right way to think about that one?
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Patrick. It – when we first acquired Cepheid we were very confident in it sustaining a double-digit core growth rate. And obviously, since that acquisition at 20% better that's been higher than we've expected and it's – there's a number of factors there a lot of which I think – a couple of which you might say are somewhat a function of the nature of that business being impacted by flu. We've just come through, I think at least two years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunately for patients and – but obviously good for that business. And you can have businesses where – or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu. And driving that installed base. The numbers that I quoted earlier have been a big part of that. So, I think you put all that together. And you say hey! Plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better. And based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution.
Patrick Donnelly: That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Europe, pretty solid mid-single-digit growth there, obviously continue to get some mixed data points around that region. You guys always have a pretty good handle given your diverse exposure. Can you just talk through the trends you've seen there, expectations into 2020 visibility, would be really helpful.
Tom Joyce: Yeah. I mean, Patrick, we're not a great sort of macro proxy. But relative to our end markets, Europe in some respects has been a pleasant surprise in terms of its being relatively solid in the last couple of quarters. So, I'm not sure that gives me a lot of optimism, in terms of anything that might improve substantially in Europe right now. But I think it's certainly been a solid market for us. If you look across how each of our four platforms are performing there, each of them are doing quite well, but it's obviously a little bit weaker than the other parts of the world.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, Patrick maybe just to put some numbers to that, that has been a pretty solid 3% to 4% grower for us for probably six, eight quarters now. And looking forward, I think that's about where we still think it will be. As Tom said, it's probably not as good as some of our other markets like, China and the U.S. which are more mid-to-high single. But I think that 3% to 4% is a pretty good place to -- sort of been, I think it's sort of where we'll be.
Patrick Donnelly: Got it, great, thanks, Matt, I appreciate it.
Operator: And presenters, that does conclude the allotted time for questions. Do you have any closing remarks?
Tom Joyce: Thanks everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 08:00:00) =====

Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter as we delivered 5% core revenue growth and solid core margin expansion. We believe our ongoing investments in innovation and commercial initiatives help to continue building sustainable competitive advantages across a number of our businesses. We also made meaningful progress on our two most recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of GE Biopharma and the initial public offering of our dental business. During the quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the GE Biopharma. Earlier this week, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain businesses to Sartorius for a purchase price of $750 million.  The revenue to be divested is approximately $140 million and consists of our label-free biomolecular characterization chromatography hardware and resins, microcarriers and particle validation standards businesses. All of these businesses are part of our life science platform. While the sale to Sartorius remains subject to certain regulatory approval, it represents a significant step in the GE Biopharma regulatory process. Timing around meeting certain closing conditions such as regulatory approvals can, of course, be uncertain. However, we remain very encouraged by the progress we're making and expect to close the GE Biopharma transaction in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we recently announced that the business will be called Cytiva when it officially becomes part of Danaher. The name is derived from Greek and Latin roots, meaning cell and doing. And everything biopharma customers do relate to the use, growth or analysis of cells. The name may be new, but the Cytiva logo, or the drop, is actually a reference to the iconic Pharmacia brand of the business going back to the 1960s. Pharmacia was a pioneer in the development of process chromatography and was one of the first businesses to become part of GE Biopharma. We received terrific feedback on the reintroduction of the drop logo as we look to build on its legacy under the new Cytiva brand. And lastly, we continue to make progress on the financing of the GE transaction. In September, we raised approximately $6.8 billion in euro-denominated debt. We raised this debt at a combined interest rate of less than 1%, with an average maturity of approximately 14 years. We anticipate raising the remaining debt required to finance the transaction prior to year-end. On September 18, our dental platform, now called Envista, started trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NVST. I want to thank Amir Aghdaei and all of the Envista associates for their contribution. We wish them the very best as they embark on this exciting new endeavor. Envista released their third quarter earnings earlier this morning and will be holding a conference call at 11 AM Eastern Time to discuss those results. We ask that you direct any questions on Envista's business performance through the Envista team. So, turning to our third quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $5 billion, with core revenue growth of 5% on a consolidated basis and 6% core revenue growth when excluding the results of our dental segment. Acquisitions increased revenues by 0.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high-growth markets increased high-single digit, with China growing at that rate, while Russia and Eastern Europe both grew double-digits. Developed markets increase mid-single digits, with North America leading the way. Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit margin was 16.6%, with core operating margins increasing 70 basis points, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Now for the third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6%, with 6.5% core revenue growth. Operating profit margin increased by 60 basis points, with core operating margins expanding 100 basis points. At segment Life Sciences, we believe we continue to grow above the market as core revenue increased double-digits. We saw strength across most major geographies and product lines as new product introductions continued to contribute meaningfully to core revenue growth. In particular, we believe [indiscernible] cytometry with the CytoFLEX platform and dry reagents as these innovative product lines are simplifying customer workflows.  Additionally, Labcyte, the automated liquid handling business we acquired earlier this year, is growing double-digits and has exceeded our initial expectations. Core revenue at SCIEX declined slightly, in part due to a tough year-over-year comparison as the business grew nearly 10% in the third quarter last year. We saw strength in high-growth markets, and that was offset by softness in North America and Western Europe. At Pall, the team achieved high-single digit core revenue growth as we saw good performance in both the developed and the high-growth markets. The biotech and aerospace businesses saw the largest increases, offset by continued softness in microelectronics. August marked the fourth anniversary of our acquisition of Pall. Over the last four years, with the application of Danaher Business System, Pall has accelerated core revenue growth, expanded gross margins by greater than 500 basis points to approximately 55%, and increased operating margins nearly 1,000 basis points to above 25%. Implementing DBS tools has not only enhanced the financial performance, but also improved operational efficiency, expanded commercial capabilities and increased the cadence of innovation across the business. Turning to IDT. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth with solid results across all major geographies. By product line, the business saw particular strength in next-generation sequencing and synthetic biology. In August, IDT continued to expand its product portfolio in the high-growth areas with the launch of a new product, oPools, the longest strands of ready-to-use DNA on the market. IDT's proprietary manufacturing process allows them to create DNA at the highest quality levels, enabling scientists focused on developing advanced diagnostic tests and treatments, to generate more consistent and reliable results in their research. Now moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenues increased 6.5%, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported and core operating profit margins increased by 100 basis points. DBS-led commercial and operational execution drove performance across the Diagnostics platform. Beckman Diagnostics had its fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit core revenue growth, driven by strength in high-growth markets and increases in North America. A key driver of Beckman's improved growth performance has been its increased cadence of new product introductions. At the American Association for Clinical Chemistry tradeshow in August, Beckman highlighted a number of these recent innovations, including the DxH 900 high-volume hematology analyzer, as well as the DxA 5000 laboratory automation systems. The DxH 900, with its early sepsis indicator, has been a key contributor in the improved performance in Beckman's hematology business. In automation, the DxA 5000, which was launched in Europe earlier this year, recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The system's key benefits of detecting pre-analytical sample quality, increasing turnaround time and reducing the number of manual processing steps from 32 to 4 are driving early adoption and great customer feedback.  Turning to Radiometer. Core revenue growth increased double-digits led by strong results in China and Japan as we believe the team drove market share gains in our blood gas and immunoassay product lines. Leica Biosystems also delivered double-digit core revenue growth, led by North American and Japan. Success at Leica is being driven by new product introductions combined with the implementation of growth rooms, one of our most impactful DBS commercial tools. Growth rooms enable cross functional teams to collaborate and align actions around the businesses' most critical short and long-term commercial initiatives.  With this focused approach, Leica's core histology and advanced staining product lines delivered mid-single digit core growth or better in each of the last eight quarters.  Finally, at Cepheid, core revenues increased double-digits across all major geographies and product lines. Next month will mark Cepheid's third anniversary with Danaher and we could not be more pleased with what the team has accomplished. Since acquisition,, the business has grown double-digits annually to nearly $1 billion in revenue. Gross margins have expanded by 1,000 basis points to approximately 50%. R&D investments have increased by over $50 million annually, while operating profit margins have increased from breakeven to approximately 20%. Cepheid highlights another powerful example of how running the Danaher playbook by applying DBS to drive growth and expand margins allows for investments back into the business that helps drive compounding returns. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenues increased 0.5%, with core revenue growth increasing at 2%. Operating profit margin remained constant, with core operating margins expanding 10 basis points. In Product Identification, core revenue declined slightly, driven in part by tough prior-year comparisons at Videojet, partially offset by growth in our packaging businesses. At VJ, core revenue declined low-single digits on a nearly 10% comparison to the third quarter last year. Despite the results of the quarter, we're encouraged by a positive order growth and expect improved performance in the fourth quarter. Last month, at the annual PACK EXPO tradeshow, Videojet showcased some of its recent instrument and digital innovations. On the instrument side, Videojet highlighted the VJ 7340 laser printer, featuring the smallest marking head available on the market today and allowing for easy integration into existing packaging lines. Videojet also released Rapid Recover, a digital solution that automatically troubleshoots and diagnoses printer service issues. This functionality builds on Videojet's market-leading service capabilities and improves customer uptime by increasing first-time fixed rates and avoiding costly investigation time. In our packaging businesses, which include Esko and X-Rite, core revenue increased at low-single digit rates, continuing the improving trends that we referenced in these businesses last quarter. Developed markets led the way, offsetting some softness in high-growth markets. Finally, at Water Quality, solid execution across the platform drove mid-single digit core revenue growth on top of a double-digit prior-year comparison.  So, looking at performance by operating company, Trojan core revenue increased double-digits led by North America. The team saw strong performance in the municipal market in both its UV and filtration product lines, driven by high win rates and service expansion initiatives. At Hach, core revenue increased low-single digits. Strong performance in Europe and North America was offset by declines in China due to a difficult comparison versus 2018 related to China's surface water initiative, Policy 61. At ChemTreat, core revenue increased mid-single digits, driven by strength in the oil and gas as well as the food and beverage end markets. In September, many of you attended our water quality platform investor day at Hach in Loveland, Colorado. On that day, we highlighted the key strategic initiatives of the platform. You also saw details on the sustainable business model that's common across Danaher, including strong underlying secular growth drivers, exceptional margin profiles and high recurring revenues.  The team provided examples throughout the day of customer-focused workflow solutions, innovation and go-to-market execution that we believe have led to share gains across Water Quality. Finally, the day showcased the variety of tools within the Danaher Business System to accelerate the cadence of innovation and drive sustainable long-term results across the platform. The presentation and webcast are available in the Investors section of our website and I encourage those who weren't able to attend the event to take a look. So, to wrap up. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance and the hard work the team has put in throughout the year. It's also worth highlighting the steps we've taken over the last several years to transform the portfolio. Through acquisitions, we brought in fundamentally higher growth businesses with significant consumables and aftermarket positions. Today, we consider 70% of our revenue to be recurring, with much of it being captive to our installed base and mission-critical to our customers' daily operations. Combined with our significant organic investments in innovation and outstanding team, the Danaher Business System, we're excited about the opportunity through the end of 2019 and beyond. So, we're initiating fourth-quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.35. We anticipate core revenue growth to be approximately 4.5% which excludes our Dental segment. We now expect full-year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.77. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year EPS guidance include the dilution from noncontrolling interest related to the 19.4% of Envista we no longer own.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kathy, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning, Tycho. 
Tycho Peterson: Good morning. I'd like to start with the Diagnostics strength. You guys continue to put up great numbers there. Can you talk a little bit about how much of this is driven by the new hematology and automation launches? Can you comment on China? We've heard about some hospital issues there for Diagnostics. And here in the US, we did hear Quest the other day talk about vendor consolidation. Just curious how you think you're positioned as we go through that process with DxA 5000. Thanks.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. A lot to cover there, starting with hematology. We've talked over the last several months, couple of quarters certainly, and most recently in my prepared remarks, about the impact of our new hematology product line. I think you probably know, Tycho, it's been in the works really since we acquired Beckman. That particular product line was a product line where we had some real challenges. And these new products, the DxH product line, particularly 900 with the early sepsis indicator, is making a significant difference. We have literally turned that business around from a business where we were not happy with our retention and our win rates to the point where now we're very happy with our retention and our win rates. And we're seeing growth in that business now that is having a material impact on the improved performance that you're now seeing from Beckman overall. Relative to the overall growth of Beckman, however, it's not purely a hematology story. Improvements in our menu across the board, across each of the analytical modalities, improvements in our automation systems – I noted the DxA 5000 which is also having impact, particularly in labs that are really challenged in terms of throughput and skilled labor where we're reducing the need for skilled labor. It's really all of those things combined that are having impact on seeing that consistent mid-single digit growth rate that Beckman is now improving towards. So, I think it's a combination of things. You asked specifically about China. We're seeing continued good performance in China. Beckman has always had a strong position in China. It's always been a key growth driver for us and it continues to be so. Clearly, it's is a highly competitive market, but we are extremely well-positioned there and continuing to see good growth, very high retention rates and very solid win rates as well. You asked about vendor consolidation. And if I caught your question accurately, I think the question was related to North America. And assuming I heard that accurately, clearly, there's always an effort across hospitals today to drive cost reductions. Vendor consolidation is certainly a part of that. But, again, as we look at our win rates and our retention rates across our North American business which is, obviously, an important part of the overall profile of Beck Dx, we continue to see both improved performance there and sustained improved performance. And again, that's underpinning that greater consistency of improvement, in fact, throughout the quarter. So, hopefully, I covered the water front. If I didn't, Tycho, happy to take a follow-up.
Matt McGrew: Tycho, it's Matt. Tom mentioned Beckman in China, but just to give you some context on Diagnostics overall in China because that might have been part of the question as well. So, from a diagnostics perspective, in China, we were double digit core here in the quarter, just to give you some sense of the overall market over there.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then, one follow-up on Life Sciences, 6.5% core against a 9.5% comp. That certainly stands out. Just curious how you think about the sustainability of that? A lot of that, I guess, Pall up high-single digit as well.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Tycho, we feel very good about the sustainability of our performance across Life Science. If we step back and we think about kind of Pall side of the house versus Life Science tools, Life Science tools continue to be mid-single digit across the platform. Our underlying businesses like Molecular Devices, like Microsystems, both mid-single digit performance. And then, Beck LS, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, double-digit performance. So, on the tool side, really good performance. Obviously, a little bit more weakness in SCIEX, but we're very encouraged by the order trends that we see there. So, probably only one spot there that was maybe a little bit weaker. But, overall, I'd say the tool side very solid. And then, across the Pall business and what we would see is really the biopharma side of Pall, again, very good performance there. A solid market that we see continuing to perform well. Our biopharma exposure is now north of a $1.5 billion, most of that obviously coming from Pall Biotech. Pall Biotech saw double-digit core growth in the quarter. That's six quarters in a row of double-digit core growth. And the order trends look very good. We're also seeing good sustained performance across single-use technologies and gene and cell therapies, which are showing double-digit core growth. Admittedly, some of those are smaller portions of the overall portfolio, but really good performance. And we think those are sustainable positions over time, and building. 
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Lastly, could you give us the Pall industrial number?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Pall industrial, on the quarter, was…
Matt McGrew: Low-single digits, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Good morning. Hey, did I catch you correctly, the fourth quarter guidance is 4.5% core growth ex-Dental?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That is correct.
Derik De Bruin: All right. Can you sort of walk-through just sort of the market dynamics as we get there? I think that's a little bit lower than what we would've thought on it? I'm just sort of curious what you're sort of like assuming in terms of year-end spending and sort of unpack that, walking through those numbers.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, of course. As you know, I think just stepping back a second, we've had eight quarters in a row of mid-single digit core growth. And we think the fourth quarter is a mid-single digit growth rate quarter as well. However, there are a couple of timing dynamics relative to our most recent – to our third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So, particularly in Diagnostics where we saw like a biosystems or radiometer at double-digit core growth rates in Q3, little help from the VIT [ph] impact in Japan, those businesses will moderate a little bit off of that double-digit core growth in Q3. And also, a couple of timing issues relative to the Life Science side where we had a big Q3, particularly for Pall, where they were some large equipment orders across biotech and the industrial side that moved from Q4 into Q3. So, really, we're talking about a little bit of timing impact there between Q3 and Q4, but we feel very good about our execution, very good about the underlying market dynamics across both Life Sciences and Diagnostics as well as across Water Quality and PID. And when you then look at our fourth quarter guidance in light of the full year, we're still talking about a full year of 2019 at 5.5% to 6%, and that's very consistent with what we talked about for the last couple of quarters. So, in general, we would characterize that fourth quarter, relative to the third, as likely more to do with timing, but still feel very good about where we'll bring in the full year.
Derik De Bruin: Okay. That's helpful. And just out of curiosity, you talked a little bit about Western Europe and what's going on there, and specifically just wondering if some of the bioprocess strength you've seen or some of the stuff you've seen is potentially related to pull forwards in – because people are worried about Brexit and stuff. We've heard that from other companies recently that there may be some spending patterns that we've seen this year, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the European trends and sort of how that market is shaping up into the close?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. We are not seeing any sort of unusual procurement behavior in that regard in Western Europe. Europe, overall, across Q3 was performing at about a low-single digit rate. That's down a little bit clearly from the first half. We've seen a bit of softness in certain pockets, like at Videojet, a bit at SCIEX and a bit at like a Microsystems.  As we look at where those pockets of softness, I think they really speak to some of the overall macro softness in Europe because when we unpack where some of the differences are between the first half and the second half, it largely looks to be around instrumentation and equipment, some of the larger capital spend, some of the OEM customers, for example, in the packaging world, those are the areas where we some of that softness. So, I would attribute that low-single digit performance in Europe a little bit more to the macro softness in Europe than I would some – any unusual procurement behavior going on one way or the other.
Derik De Bruin: And that's stuff that's not sort of have been into the research labs, it's more the industrial…
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That's right. Those are the areas that would speak a little bit more to the industrial side of the house. Admittedly, we're not – with our low percentage of the portfolio that's literally industrially exposed, we're not a terrific proxy, but we can certainly see a few of those pockets, whether it's in North America or in developed Europe where some of that macro slowdown exists. But again those are pretty small pockets.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
VijayKumar: Thanks for taking the question, guys. And congrats on a nice print here. So, Tom, maybe one big picture question for you to start off with. On a pro forma basis, when you look at the assets, some of the comments you made on DBS and how underlying growth for acquired business have improved, if I just look at the numbers, the core Danaher is, call it, a mid singles core. Ex-Dental, that helps your core. And now GE comes in with DBS, this seems to be a solid mid singles. And even if macro were to soften going forward, it seems like that mid-single digit, that stable, strong, mid-single digit piece that should be pretty much intact. So, I'm just curious on that pro forma growth outlook on how you guys are looking at it?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Well, Vijay, first of all, I think your summary of the portfolio today is an accurate one. We've made tremendous progress in the evolution of the portfolio towards establishing that mid-single digit growth performance. And I think we've done that with businesses that have demonstrated, over time and over cycles, their stability in driving that consistent kind of growth performance. Now, some of that comes from being in terrific markets with leading positions in those markets, but it also comes from the nature of the balance of sale whereby, as I mentioned earlier, with 70% of our revenue roughly being recurring revenue, largely in the form of consumables that are captive to the instrumentation and with the addition of service and other associated aftermarket, the combination of being in great markets with leading businesses and that strong aftermarket consumables position is what gives us confidence that we built a portfolio that is designed to be sustainable over macro cycles. Now, that doesn't mean that we are completely immune, as I just mentioned about a couple of soft spots here and there that could be geographic or could be where we have a little bit of exposure to a more industrial-oriented market. But in general, we've built a portfolio to that effect. And, yes, the addition of the GE Biopharma business is but one more significant step in reinforcing that kind of market position. So, we feel very good about that looking forward into 2020 and beyond.
VijayKumar: That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick one for you on this fourth quarter guidance. It looks like the guide implies a solid market expansion in Q4. One, am I right in my math on that solid margin expansion and maybe comment on where this is coming from, OpEx versus IGM?
Matt McGrew: Yeah, it's probably going to be a little bit of both on the gross margin side and the OpEx. But the way that I kind of think about – I think you're right, Vijay. I think the way that we kind of think about the Q4 guide, especially with some of the noise in there with the NCI and the FX, we're kind of talking about 4.5% core growth, kind of a normal solid 35% fall through. And really, that NCI headwind of call it a couple of pennies is really the only change here that we've sort of made to the guide, if you will. But, yeah, I think you're right, we anticipate having pretty good fall through like we normally would expect here in the fourth quarter. I suspect it will be a little bit on the gross margin side and probably with that comes the operating leverage as well.
VijayKumar: Thanks, guys.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Hi, Scott. How you're doing?
Scott Davis: Great. It's easy covering your company. Every quarter, you put up decent numbers and not exactly sure what you make and what you sell, but it's working.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Scott, you know we love to make life easy for all of the visitors on this call. One of our goals, among many.
Scott Davis: I don't know if I might be the last industrial guy left, but you're not going to get rid of me that easily.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: That's okay. Welcome back. What's up today?
Scott Davis: So, I've got two questions for you, Tom. The first is just the asset sales. Maybe a little bit of color around how this – was this a compromise with the regulators, was this something the regulators requested, was it US regulators or was it more globally geared? Just a little bit more color on that.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Scott. Well, when we initially announced this deal, we did it with the clear understanding that regulators were going to do what obviously they would do in a deal of this magnitude, and that that would be done across the span of regulatory bodies from the US to Europe, other countries and certainly to China. And so, eyes wide open that those reviews would take place and that there was always a prospect that there could be a small portion of the GE portfolio or the Danaher Life Science portfolio that the regulators may have questions about. And so, the sale of the businesses that we announced earlier this week to Sartorius was really a function of what we believe were very constructive discussions with regulatory bodies across the world and with a clear understanding of what the rationales were from their perspective as well as ours, and this is simply something that regulatory bodies along with us came to the point where we thought – where both parties thought that this made sense. And so, it really was a series of globally-oriented conversations and made sense to take that step.
Scott Davis:
,:
Matt McGrew: Yeah, Scott. It's Matt. So, I think if you kind of look back at maybe the two core metrics, if you will, that we sort of talk about with deals, if you think about core growth at Pall, so when we kind of bought Pall, I would say it was more of a low-single digit core growth business, in that over the course of, let's say, last, I guess – like you said, four years here, the team has done a really good job at kind of taking DBS – in particular, DBS on the growth side and the innovation side and really changing that fundamentally to be more of a mid-single digit plus type growth rate. So, I think you've seen a significant progress on the top line. As far as kind of OP goes, I think when that business came in, it was kind of a high teens type of OP. Today, we sort of own that business at, call it, a 1000 basis points better than that. So, we've made really good progress on kind of the team coming in there and taking out some of the costs that we knew were there. I think, if you remember, we talked about kind of a cost target at the initial that was kind of $300 million. I think we took that up even to $350 million ultimately. So, from an ROIC perspective, I think that so far as we stand here, I would stay that that exceeds where we thought we would be.
Scott Davis: Okay. Well, congratulations on that. Thank you, guys.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Hey, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: Hey, good morning, guys. So, I guess, first a question on interest rates. So, the interest rate on the Eurobond was under 1%. Recognizing you still need to issue the rest of the debt and probably a good chance it's going to come in at a rate that is at least slightly higher than the Eurobond, it still seems like you're going to have some upside relative to the deal model you shared with the investment community originally. So, by our math, every 50 basis points of lower interest rate translates into about $0.10 of earnings upside. Does that seem reasonable and should we expect you to let this flow through or is there likely to be some reinvestment?
Matt McGrew: Yeah. I think the numbers that you're quoting on the Eurobond are accurate, obviously. I don't think – and we do still need to do the US deal here. And like you said, I suspect that will probably be at a higher rate, but we will get to that in the fourth quarter. I think as far as kind of trying to think through the deal model, I think I would say, at this point, we are not trying to update, if you will, kind of the GE accretion. We're, obviously, going to have some moving pieces here. You're going to have a little bit of a headwind, though modest, from the divestitures that we just announced on Monday. Obviously, just talked about likely some favorable financing costs so far on the Eurobond deal. Also, likely to have a business in the GE Biopharma business that when it – it's had a pretty good year here in 2019. So, I think the way to think about it is we will kind of holistically pull all of that together for you when we do update the guide, so that we can kind of incorporate all of that at one time.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you for that. And very quick follow-up related to the deal as well and following up on the last question on divestitures. Based on where you are in the regulatory process and the fact that you did announce those divestitures earlier this week, how would you characterize the probability that additional divestitures could be required from here on out?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Well, Doug, as you saw in the announcement – first of all, those divestitures are pretty modest on a relative basis at $140 million. So, less than 5% of the revenues that we are going to acquire. But, of course, the regulatory process is a fluid one. So, while we believe this was a significant – a major step towards approval, at this point, we can't comment on this any further. It was an important milestone. But as we commented, we don't expect either this deal to close, nor the actual formality of those approvals to be completed until the first quarter and, therefore, closing immediately following that. We can't comment any further about any prospects for any further actions.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Totally understood. Maybe just a couple on the quarter. First, on Diagnostics, core margin expanded 100 basis points and was ahead of our forecast. Could you talk through some detail on that performance? And specifically, I'd be curious how Cepheid margins are progressing and how growth improvement at Beckman is really contributing to this performance? And then, just on Pall, it seems like the bioprocessing market is growing broadly at a very strong 15-plus percent rate based on what some of your peers have reported over the last few days. I think you noted that Pall Biotech grew double digits. Is it reasonable to believe that you're growing Pall Biotech at least at that 15% plus level that we're hearing from others? Thank you.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Doug, I'll take the Biopharma piece first and Matt will jump back in on the Dx margins. Yes, the simple answer is, what you are hearing from other sources around the growth in the bioprocessing market overall as being a double-digit growth rate market and a very attractive one, and one by the way that we and obviously others believe is sustainable in terms of its growth prospects, we at Pall are clearly benefiting from that and taking advantage of that opportunity to drive that kind of growth. We did put up double-digit growth within that business, and that's across obviously our filtration business, which is fundamental to biologic drug production, but also includes growth in the really innovative ends of the spectrum around Biopharma which is really around single use technologies which are becoming increasingly important as biological drugs are being produced in smaller and smaller batch sizes for unique patient populations, as well as in the growth areas around cell and gene therapy, which while being somewhat nascent today are going to be significant growth drivers in the future and we are participating in that growth today with outstanding products and I think a series of new products that will be coming over time that we're very excited about.
Matt McGrew: Yeah, Doug. As far as the Dx margins go, in particular in the quarter, I think we had a pretty good performance generally speaking out of all of the businesses, but I would call out both like a biosystems and radiometer. Those are some of our higher margin businesses and, obviously, both of those growing sort of in the double-digit core growth. Certainly helps the margin performance. But, overall, I think it was pretty good with a little bit of a boost here from those businesses that had been kind of sort of high-single digits here year-to-date, turning in kind of a low-double digit performance in the quarter. So, I think that's a big ramp of it. As far as Cepheid's margins go, again, it's sort of similar to the Pall story. I think the team there has done a fantastic job of really balancing growth, while also focusing on the margin side of it. And they've done a really nice job of kind of embracing DBS and leading from the front. And today, I think when we bought it, it was sort of a – maybe a breakeven type business from an OP perspective. And today, those margins are, call it, 20% or so from an EBITA [ph] perspective.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.
Steve Beuchaw: Hi. Good morning and thanks.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Good morning
Steve Beuchaw: I had just a couple for Tom and then one for Matt. Tom, I wonder if you wouldn't mind unpacking the number at SCIEX a little bit. I'd say prospectively, you mentioned that you saw some really good trends on orders. It would be helpful to know a little bit more about what you're seeing. And then, for the quarter, SCIEX is a little bit unique relative to some tools businesses, in that you have a clinical exposure. It would be nice to hear how you saw the relative trends in that business between clinical, some of the core applied markets where you have a good presence. And then, to the extent you have any comment on what you're seeing on pharma on the R&D, that would be really helpful. Second question is just more of a global question on municipal and broader government project demand. You're uniquely well positioned to have a view on how that's tracking.  And then, I'll go ahead and, Matt, ask you just one. And more of a prospective, big picture question. You have a lot of moving parts in the model given that we're divesting Dental and we have GE coming into the fray, looking for the majority of 2020. Can you just talk prospectively about the impact on earnings and cash to the extent you can, associated with those transitions? If you can give us any update on the thinking, so we know how and maybe some of it's below the line to think about those items going forward. Really appreciate the help here.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Steve. Thanks. So, let's start with SCIEX. You heard my comment accurately that while SCIEX was down slightly in the quarter, we are, in fact, encouraged by the order trends that we're seeing and we do in fact expect some improved performance in the fourth quarter. When we look at the quarter itself, third quarter, we clearly were up against a tough comp. SCIEX, so I think I mentioned was up nearly 10% in the third quarter of last year. So, certainly, a bit of a challenge from a comp standpoint. But we did see some – outside of that, some softness in North America. A little bit of that was timing of some larger deals in the second half between Q3 and Q4, but also – and this does get a little bit into some of the market segments that you asked about. We are seeing the consolidation of some small and midsize reference labs, and that has created a bit of a headwind there.  You asked about specifically the clinical market, and SCIEX has certainly had a position in clinical over time, but over the last couple of years, we've seen a number of challenges in that market that are not unique to SCIEX. Just broadly defined challenges around changes in reimbursement and guidelines around pain management, for one example. And, certainly, the impact both across small and midsize labs are related to those challenges in clinical. So, SCIEX was really built on the back of tremendous strength and depth of technologies and capabilities around pharma. Small molecule certainly originally and more recently around large molecule positions. And those positions continue to be reasonably good, particularly biopharma which, obviously, is a growth segment. Core small molecule pharma was much more modest in its growth globally. Academic was actually – remain pretty good really across North America and China. And I think, overall, we think SCIEX is going to continue to be a leader in that market, a real innovator and one where, over time, we'll see a pickup after third quarter. You asked about the municipal market. And our exposure to the municipal market or the government market is, for the most part, associated with our Water Quality platform. And in that case, the term municipal is probably more appropriate to our position really than any broader governmental construct, at least in the US. And what we've seen most recently in the US and in Europe would be that municipal spending has generally been pretty consistent. And that's what's driven the mid-single digit growth rates that we put up at Water Quality across the US and Western Europe. And that applies certainly to Hach, it applies to Trojan and a bit to ChemTreat, although ChemTreat tends to be more associated with applied markets. In China, where we continue to see good performance for our Water Quality platform, albeit against a very tough comp associated with what's called Policy 61, which we noted in the prepared remarks, that market is continuing to be an outstanding market. And, yes, it is largely associated with government or, in particular, environmental ministry oriented regulations, such as Policy 61 which drove an increased level of monitoring in surface waters across China last year. That will continue to be a positive dynamic across water quality. So, right now, we see pretty consistent and steady performance around both municipal spending in the developed markets as well as a little bit more governmental orientated attention to environmental issues in the high growth markets.
Matt McGrew: And, Steve, as far your kind of – your question on the moving pieces with GE and Dental, I think maybe the way I think about it is sort of that, from an EPS perspective, obviously, Q4, there's no GE impact. And we talked a little bit here earlier about all the moving pieces that are there and, obviously, as we get a little closer to close, we will update all of that for 2020. But as far as Q4, obviously, nothing to think about. As far as Q4 goes for EPS for Envista, the NCI, I kind of put a placeholder of maybe $0.02 in there for the NCI for the fourth quarter. And then, as far as kind of cash flow goes, I think that was your next question. If you think about, we sort of talked about GE coming in at maybe roughly $1 billion worth of cash flow and Envista will kind of be out there, I think, talking to you guys about their own 2020 cash flow projections when they get a little closer. So, I don't want to kind of speak for them, but I think you can kind of pencil in that GE have call it a billion and we'll let Envista talk about 2020 cash flow when they talk to you guys later today.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay. Great details. Really appreciate the time here.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.
Dan Brennan: Thank you. Great. So, maybe a question just on Q3, Q4. Tom, I think you mentioned a few times, maybe a little bit of timing benefit or timing push out. And, obviously, with the size of Danaher, I'm sure there's always lots of small shifts. But just wanted to understand, was there a more pronounced timing benefit this quarter? And maybe could you just help us then think about – implicit in your fourth quarter guide, how do we think about kind of Life Science, Diagnostics and kind of EAS?
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure, Dan. Yeah, I think perhaps a little bit of timing issue between Q3 and Q4 here and the margin would have been a little bit more pronounced than what we've seen. But I think if you look at the fundamentals underneath each one of the platforms, Life Science, Diagnostics and EAS, each one of them continued to perform quite well. Again, our exposure to the macro environment is somewhat limited in the sense of being a good proxy for an industrial slowdown. We don't have a lot of industrial exposure left. And so, we generally feel very good about how the overall platform will perform going through the fourth quarter and how we're set up for 2020.
Dan Brennan: Okay. Great. And then, you kind of touched upon my kind of second part of the question. Maybe could you help us think about, like maybe between your 70% recurring business on instrument side of the house, were there – you mentioned earlier in the call that there's a bit of pressure there from what you're seeing globally. It's a question we get a lot, like differentiating between Danaher and other players in the broader tool spaces, the global economy is getting softer. So, how do we think about kind of your instrument kind of growth rate kind of as we look out here with PMIs being a bit weak and the global economy slowing? Thanks, Tom.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: Sure. Here's one sort of way to think about it, Dan, using some specific numbers. If you look at the third quarter, our consumables business was up, call it, 6% versus the equipment side of the house, which is up more like 4%. And so, if you think back to the last couple of quarters, those have been closer to even – about equal equipment versus consumables. Here you see the consumables number continuing to be quite strong and the equipment number being a little bit softer. And I think that's probably the best way to look at what is underneath some of the softness that I talked about that may be impacted by the macro environment across a business like Videojet, for example, or SCIEX or possibly like a Microsystems, probably to name three examples of businesses where the equipment side of the house is a higher percentage of the balance of sale than on average across the portfolio. 
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Joyce, Jr.: You bet. 
Operator: We have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for closing remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Kathy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.

Tom Joyce: Thank you Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased for our strong second quarter performance. We delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, we continued investments in innovation and commercial initiatives contributing to share gains across many of our businesses. This marks the seventh straight quarter of 5% or better core growth which combined with solid operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow is a testament to our team’s focused execution and the power of the Danaher Business System. We also continue to make progress on our anticipated acquisition of GE Biopharma and the planned IPO of our Dental business and both transactions remain on track relative to our previously communicated expectations. As we move into the second half of 2019 we’re excited about these important portfolio moods and the opportunities that lie ahead for Danaher. So now let’s turn to our second quarter results. Sales grew 3.5% to $5.2 billion, with core revenue growth of 5.5%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 1%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 3%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in India and approximately 10% growth in China. We saw mid single-digit growth across the developed markets with both the U.S. and Western Europe growing in that range. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.8%, and operating profit margin was 17.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. However, core operating margin increased 15 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. We’ve generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter resulting in double digit growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 137%. So now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6.5% with 7.5% core revenue growth. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of high single digit or better core revenue growth in the segment. Reported operating profit margin was up 190 basis points to 20.1% with core operating margins increasing 170 basis points. This terrific margin performance was a result of the team's outstanding DBS driven execution across the segment. Beckman Life Sciences’ core revenue growth with a high single digit as performance was led by double-digit growth in both flow cytometry and particle counting and characterization. The strength in particle counting was led by Vi-CELL product line which is primarily used analyze to cell viability in biopharmaceutical applications. In addition Beckman closed the both on acquisition of Cytobank a software solution that pairs with our flow cytometry platform to help biopharma and clinical research customers analyze complex datasets more quickly and efficiently. Core revenue at SCIEX grew at a mid-single digit rate. Good results across the pharmaceutical and applied end markets were partially offset by the continued impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business. We've made significant investments to improve the cadence of innovation at SCIEX since we acquired the business nearly 10 years ago. The team highlighted several new products last month at ASMS including Echo MS a non-contact liquid handling solution with very high analytical throughput. This first-of-its-kind technology enables mass spectrometry’s rich data generation to be used in new applications within the drug development workflow helping customers in their pursuit a breakthrough disease treatments. At Pall, high single-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and end markets. Pall Industrial was up mid single digits with strong results in our aerospace and process and industrial businesses. This was partially offset by microelectronics which declined due to a tough prior year comparison and softer end markets. Double-digit growth in Pall Life Sciences was led by our biotech business where we saw broad-based demand across product lines. An important highlight during the quarter with the U.S. FDA's approval of a pediatric gene therapy which is manufactured using Pall's iCELLis bioreactor. So Zolgensma is the first gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy or SMA in children under the age of 2. SMA is the number one genetic cause of death for infants and Pall is proud to contribute to the breakthrough treatment for this devastating disease. The second quarter marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of IDT and we couldn't be happier with the progress the team has made so far. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth driven by broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Moving now to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 4.5% with core revenue growth of 7.5%. Reported operating margin was 17.5% with reported and core margins down 20 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign currency headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar and tariff related costs. At Beckman Diagnostics, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by high growth markets, particularly China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. Momentum from recent product launches is benefiting Beckman in a number of key product areas, enhancing the business' competitive position and accelerating its growth trajectory. We are particularly encouraged by ongoing improvements in our hematology business where we continue to see strong global demand for our new DxH 900 high-volume analyzer. Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth with strength across the developed markets and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines both performed well with key competitive wins contributing to market share gains. Leica Biosystems’ core revenue was up mid-single digits. Good results across Advanced Staining and core histology were driven by demand for recently introduced products and we believe LBS continued to take share relative to the market. Finally, at Cepheid core revenue is up more than 20% on continued momentum in North America and strong results across high growth markets. Cepheid embrace of DBS growth tools and processes like transformative marketing and funnel management has enabled the team to make meaningful progress penetrating new accounts were particular success at integrated delivery networks in North America. Turning to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 3%, and core revenue was down 50 basis points. Reported operating profit margin declined to 11.2% with core and reported margins down 310 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of lower volume, foreign exchange rate movements and ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Low single digit declines in our traditional consumables and equipment business were partially offset by low single-digit core growth in our specialty businesses. Geographically double-digit growth in China was more than offset by continued softness in Western Europe and Latin America. As part of our expansion into clear aligners our orthodontics business Ormco highlighted Spark at the American Association of orthodontists tradeshow in May. Spark is made using TruGen a proprietary material with exceptional flexibility and clarity which provides a highly aesthetic and comfortable aligner capable of treating complex cases. Following a successful initial launch in Australia we are previewing Spark with a group of leading orthodontists in the U.S. as part of our targeted expansion and expect to build on this good early traction going forward. We continue to make good progress towards the intended IPO of our Dental business. We’ve recently announced the new company's name Envista and have identified its key senior leaders and future operating structure. We remain on track to establish Envista as a separate publicly trading company in the second half of this year. Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% and core revenue was up 4%. Reported operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.4% with 45 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison. Results were led by growth in Western Europe and high-growth markets with solid underlying end market demand worldwide. In our packaging business which includes Esko and X-Rite we were encouraged by better sequential performance and ongoing improvements in order trends. A few weeks ago Esko hosted more than 200 customers at the Esko World User Group Meeting in Nashville. The event brings together brand owners and suppliers from across the packaging workflow to showcase Esko's solutions and provides the unique forum for Esko to gather industry insight to guide impactful product innovation. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform was up mid-single digits. At Trojan double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across the developed markets in China. We saw solid demand in the municipal and industrial end markets and the team sustained its strong customer win rate with good commercial execution and new product differentiation. ChemTreat delivered high single digit core revenue growth. The North American and Latin American markets continue to lead the way with strong results in food and beverage, commercial facilities, and oil and gas. Lastly at Hach, core revenue grew in a low single-digit rate versus a double-digit prior year comparison. Good performance in North America and Western Europe benefited from demand across the municipal and industrial end markets. This was partially offset by declines in China which was meaningfully last year as a result of government initiatives around surface water monitoring which generated significant demand for Hach's unique offering. 2019 marks Hach's 20th year as part of Danaher making it one of the longest tenured operating companies in our portfolio today and a tremendous example of how we grow businesses and build platforms at Danaher. Through a combination of organic execution and strategic M&A with a commitment of DBS and a foundation of continuous improvement Hach has evolved from a $130 million business in 1999 to what is now the cornerstone of our $2.5 billion Water Quality platform. During that time the platform has increased growth and operating profit margins by over 1500 basis points and completed more than 25 acquisitions to augment growth and adjacencies in water treatment byTrojan and ChemTreat. This combination of organic and inorganic initiatives has helped drive consistent share gains and build sustainable long-term value with the platforms’ return on invested capital now in excess of 20%. You'll get to hear more about this success story at our upcoming water quality investor day in September and we hope that many of you will be able to join us for the event out at Hach's headquarters in Loveland, Colorado. So to wrap up we feel good about the momentum we generated in the first half of 2019. The remainder of this year will be transformational for Danaher with the anticipated IPO of Envista and welcoming GE Biopharma to our Life Science platform. Both incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect to maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates. We believe the combination of our differentiated portfolio the Danaher team’s DBS driven execution and our commitment to build long-term value uniquely positions us for strong performance through 2019 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.15 which assumes core growth of approximately 4.5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie we're now ready for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Congrats on another solid quarter. Tom, on the more industrial focused market, it doesn't sound like you're flagging any sort of softness or issues there. I know you had the tougher videojet comp but you did mention I think better quarter-over-quarter in order to trends and packaging so can you just talk on the outlook for Pall Industrial Product ID packaging some of these more industrial focused markets given some of the macro data points? 
Tom Joyce: Sure Tycho. Happy to, as I think you probably know well, we don't have a lot of truly industrial exposure left in the portfolio today. Call it 10% or less of the overall portfolio so admittedly we're perhaps not a great read but I'm happy to share with you some of the details behind some of the specific businesses that you asked about. In terms of the trends we're seeing broadly defined across these businesses, in general they're still pretty solid. Let's call it low single digit, mid-single digit growth rates across these businesses that I'll tell you about in a little bit more detail. So maybe let's start with say a portion of Hach. So Hach has some industrial exposure that the industrial side of Hach was up mid-single digits in the quarter. The order trends remain pretty solid across both the U.S. and Europe. Overall Hach was with low single digits in the second quarter but again that was against that big double-digit comp last year that impacted us in China. So again just look at the industrial side, pretty solid. You mentioned Pall industrial again another portion that maybe worth a little bit of a read. Pall industrial up mid single-digits in the quarter. So pretty good performance. Where we saw a little bit of softness was certainly in microelectronics that was expected. We clearly have some difficult comps there two years of double digit growth and that market has clearly softened up based on lot that’s going on in terms of the trade dynamics and that's – that market is probably not likely to improve much in the second half of the year but so that's a little bit of a soft spot there, but at Pall industrial that was more than offset by our aerospace business and what we call FTAP which is fluid technologies and asset protection both aerospace and FTAP were up double digits in the quarter. So again put that altogether mid single digit growth Pall Industrial, pretty solid VJ, you mentioned VJ again a little bit of exposure there at VJ. That was up again depending on the sub-segment low single digit to mid single digits, pretty small numbers at DJ but against your trends were pretty solid. And DJ's overall comp was although low single digit in the quarter, was again the high single digit prior year. So net we keep a very close eye on what's going on in these sub-markets. We do think they can be indicative of maybe some broader trends but our order trends remain pretty steady and again we don't have a ton of exposure but happy to keep bringing those indicators forward for everybody so sort of broader sense of the macro.
Tycho Peterson: That's helpful and maybe similar line of questions on China. I mean you had 10% growth double digit in Dental, you are under indexed to maybe food and four plus seven generic headwinds but as we think about the back half of the year and the China picture any reason that that couldn't continue at double digit levels for you guys.
Tom Joyce: Yes. Thanks. We feel very good about where we are in China. Obviously, that starts with the nature of our platform's positions there. When you think about Life Sciences diagnostics, Water Quality, the concerns around the environment, certainly even our Dental business which continues to be really well-positioned there and growing strongly, starting in the broad sense of the platform position we love where those businesses and how that platform is positioned for the secular growth drivers in China. And despite the headlines which clearly indicates that there are some slowing in China we continue to see pretty good underlying conditions and I think just to go through a few specifics, diagnostics was very strong. We're talking mid-teens kind of growth there especially at Cepheid which is again off the small base but continued to grow nicely. Beckman is doing well there. Another strong quarter of life sciences of high single digits and of course dental demand continuing a double-digit growth. So good performance there. Product ID again a smaller position in China, but pretty solid mid-single digit growth, but as I mentioned this again is probably a couple of more puts and takes there in China than we might normally have seen. Water quality being one of those against this federal mandate that existed last year around service monitoring. So that's a little bit of an impact and again what I mentioned about micro down and even that [FTAP] business probably a touch lighter. So a few little pockets there but again if we step back broadly I think we're in good shape there. As we look forward I think we'll continue to see mid-single digits to high single digit growth in Q3, but again that's only because of really this tougher comp where we had high teens, growth in Q3 of ‘18 largely driven by the water quality business. So we don't really see a meaningful slowdown in our businesses at this point, but clearly given the headlines and the data that's been put out more recently, the ongoing trade tensions, we're watching these businesses very, very closely and we will continue to update as we see things.
Tycho Peterson: Okay and then just one last clarification you got – guidance for Dental margins to be flat. I know they are down 300 basis points. How much of that was incremental investment and how should we think about Dental margins for 3Q and 4Q?
Tom Joyce: We're clearly continuing to invest around new products in that business but the lower volumes, I think are meaningful here, Tycho. It’s certainly the investment is a function there and that we think it's important to set this business up effectively for the growth to come and you've seen us lift R&D spending by 100 basis points over the last couple of years and so that portion of what we think is really essential to the future growth trajectory of the business but the volume trend is really what we need to get those new product innovations to begin to turn along with some just tailwind in that market. I think as we see that volume come back a bit that's going to be the incremental jump that we're going to need in terms of the OMX, so I think it's really a combination of those things that we'd be looking for certainly as we turn the corner into next year. I think as we look at the balance of this year we're going to continue to drive some of those investments. We're still going to have some challenges in terms of the overall growth in this market, but I think we remain very, very bullish about the prospects for this business to improve both the growth trajectory and the operating margins as we head into 2020 and beyond. 
Matt Gugino: Yes, Tycho. It’s Matt. I mean some of the volume there too is on, if you think about specialty in the quarter was kind of low single digits that typically is some of our better margin business and so I think from a mixed perspective like Tom said that lower volume and kind of where it happened here in the quarter was a big piece it.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you. 
Tom Joyce: Thanks Tycho. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.
Tom Joyce: Good morning Ross.
Ross Muken: Good morning guys. Congrats. So maybe I just want to go back to Diagnostics. I mean I felt like Cepheid probably north of 20 in the quarter. I mean, obviously, Q1 you had some tough flu comps. So I guess that that's a pretty remarkable growth where it feels even above sort of trailing 12-months levels. So I guess help us understand whether it's sort of a new product or some of the GeneXpert or just placements or new menu like or geographic, where is that upside sort of coming from and we sort of that the sort of key stages of the DBS flywheel sort of getting this business kind of churning at the rate it maybe should get too?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks Ross. You termed the flywheel is one where we love a lot, and obviously from that standpoint turning the flywheel, I would say it's still early days at Cepheid and yet we've begun to turn that flywheel at a pretty good rate but there's still opportunities to continue to enhance the RPMs, if you will. So let me take it through a few of the details. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were up north of 20% in the second quarter and some of that continues to come from our, what we call our HBDC market or High Burden Developing Country growth, but if you even backed out of the High Burden Developing Countries where we continue to see good growth, Cepheid continued to be up mid-teens in many of the core areas and core assays. So that growth continues to be really broad-based. Infectious disease led the way, flu, RSV, Strep all strong, sexual health also very good. The flu season and normally by the time we get into July here, we're not usually talking about flu, but just to go back a second, it did last – it lingered a little bit longer into April, which probably on the margin helped growth a bit as well. So I think the combination of things, with very good performance in the core assays and the developed markets and then continued good performance in HBDC. From a DBS perspective, a number of key things going on from an innovation and commercial execution perspective that are helping us to continue to drive share gains. We've netted over 300 new customers since acquisition, which is really meaningful in terms of not only the installed base that is built, but obviously the annuity stream that's associated with those captive consumables. So that market leading installed base is now north of 20,000 instruments. We closed, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mentioned IDNs. We've closed a number of major health systems or IDNs and that is again continuing to drive the installed base with strong annuity streams. The anchor assays, like flu and Strep A are key to develop to driving those wins. And I think over time we're going to, we're going to see some penetration in the physician office labs in an even deeper way with our CLIA-waived Xpress offerings and because I think those will be an important part of it. So overall, I think the team is in great shape. I was with the team at Cepheid in the early part of the year and they continue to perform exceptionally well. But I think it's still early days. I think one way to think about the early days is in terms of geographic penetration. We're still coming off a relatively small base in China, but the molecular diagnostics opportunity in China is really strong. Today, China is still probably sub-5% of Cepheid and it's going to be significantly bigger than that as years go on. We're working on getting beyond the initial test that we have approved in China, which are really around MTB and C. diff, HIV viral load, etc and we continue to build the sales force, it's up by 3X times where we started. And we got 4x or 5x the revenue. So again, small base, early days, but I think plenty of room to go.
Ross Muken: And maybe just on the pharma side, I know you called out biotech at least relative to Pall, but more broadly, I guess, how would you kind of characterize small versus large molecule demand across the portfolio? And specifically to Tycho's point before in China, any sort of anecdotal things and when we were there, it seemed quite like biologics and bio-manufacturing was on absolute fire, so just any color would be helpful. 
Tom Joyce: Sure. I think in terms of small versus large, I think we continue to see solid growth from the segment of market that's more oriented toward small molecule. Well, Ross that that's sort of our legacy, if we looked at the SCIEX business as an example of that, continued solid performance across the small molecule business, large molecule, biologics is where the faster growth is, and we see that in our Pall numbers. The Pall Life Science business up double-digits. The biotech part of that was really led by our single-use technologies and that's, those are – those single-use technologies are significantly oriented, it's not exclusively oriented to the biologic side of the house. iCELLis, I mentioned iCELLis and the iCELLis bioreactor continues to be a big source of growth for us. We look at the areas of cell and gene therapy as huge opportunities. And again, it's still early days in those markets. So I'd say coming through at all, small molecule, solid, pretty consistent large molecule, continued strong growth. You asked specifically about China. Thanks, thanks for your recent visit. That market is going quite well. But again, I think that's still a market that is in development. A lot of the history there began in the small molecule area, some of what's going on there around biosimilars is clearly a source of growth. But that market will continue to evolve over time. There is a tremendous amount of government investments that's going on, as you also probably found when you were there. And so we're very bullish about how our business in Life Science, is not just on, by the way that the process technologies you might say around filtration and ultimately around chromatography. But I think our tools business as well, whether we're talking about SCIEX and the evolution of the use of mass spectrometry in large molecules or the use of our other Life Science tools around biologic drug development and discovery. Those businesses are all tracking well.
Ross Muken: Super, helpful. Thanks Tom.
Tom Joyce: You bet Ross.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Tom Joyce: Derik, good morning.
Derik De Bruin: Good morning. How you all doing?
Tom Joyce: Great. Thanks. Nice to hear from you.
Derik De Bruin: Thank you. Couple of questions so I guess the first one would be you mentioned in your comments about like a bio that you were seeing some shared gains there and given the joining of a couple of real competitors that market and just sort of curious about the additional color on what's driving the share gains and some dismay any information on that would be a good place to start?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Yeah, you bet, happy to. First of all, we have a terrific team on that business today. Melissa Aquino who I have worked with for a long time, actually came out of our Water Quality business, ran our DBS office prior to this role is leading that business today, and just doing a wonderful job, both in terms of driving new product execution as well as the commercial side of the house. One of the things that I've been particularly impressed with is, I was with that business earlier this year, Derik, they've got the new product engines now working in that business. We struggled a bit three, four, five years ago with getting products out of R&D on time. They were great products, they ultimately were targeted at the right market. We are now getting those out faster. The rate of new product introduction is higher than it's ever been before and we're seeing the impact of that in the growth rates both in histology, the core microtome tissue processor, what you might think of is kind of the more [indiscernible] stuff is at the front end of anatomical pathology, as well as better growth rates and more product innovation around advanced staining. We still have work to do around path imaging, you recall years ago, we did the acquisition of Aperio, we think there's tremendous opportunities around the evolution of digital pathology. We have – I think many of – much of the tool set, that it takes to move pathology imaging into the mainstream, if you will, of anatomical pathology, but we've got some product development that continues to need to be done. And frankly, it's a market that's slow to adapt to those technologies, and we will need to be a little bit patient as those transitions take place within the community of pathologists. But a lot of good things going on there, but I would point primarily to product development engine, now running far more smoothly and efficiently.
Derik De Bruin: Great. And then just two related questions, one, can you just give us any update on sort of GE and timing on that whole process? And also just sort of a follow-up on Ross' question. When you think about small molecules and large molecules in cell and gene therapies, can you compare, sort of like the profitability for some of those markets. The question I'm getting to is like as you move into providing products Zolgensma and just some of these other ones that are out there. I'm just curious is those are going to be a higher margin, higher products for you, more profitable products for you, going and then doing – genomic supplying columns or supplying resins and filters for the biologics business?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Let's take in there. But let me give it a shot. So let's have a key – first of all, we continue to be really impressed with the GE team, we mentioned that when we announced the deal, that we found that coming through due diligence. But as we normally do with large acquisitions, we put a transition team together, we acquired – the soon to be acquired business has a transition team. And so, we continue to get some exposure to that team and we remain really impressed by them, it's a highly passionate and talented group with great industry experience. As you saw in Q1 from them the business is off to a great start in 2019. What we've heard a little bit is just sort of very anecdotally that things continue to track quite well. Their first quarter was – at core growth above where they've been in the last couple of years. So all indications are the business is in wonderful shape. From a transaction standpoint, we issued the equity in Q1. Clearly, the debt financing ought to be helped by what we're seeing now in lower rates, assuming those kind of hold in both the U.S. and Europe and that's just in comparison to when we announced the deal. So overall, we feel very good about where we are. No change to our expectations. We've had good and constructive dialog with the regulators and we're working with them like we would on any other deal. And so we're continuing to drive toward a fourth quarter close and feel good about that. Relative to your second question, which was around small molecule versus large molecule cell and gene therapy, and profitability, and then you made specific reference to Zolgensma and the recent introduction of that breakthrough product by the division of Novartis, your question was really around profitability, I guess. First of all, going back to the core, we've always seen good profitability in our business around small molecule related applications and large molecule. I would say no difference. Obviously as we continue to develop breakthrough new products associated with the evolution of biological drug discovery, development and processes, we continue to focus on enhancing gross margins, as we drive new product development and so obviously the value that we deliver to shareholders is directly associated back to the gross margin that we're able to achieve. And so we continue to really keep the long horizon in mind, in terms of what the market needs are, and continue to drive products that will help to enhance gross margin, which they've done. And so we feel good about that. Now, when it comes to cell and gene therapy, it's so early in the evolution of that market today, that it's hard to say anything that's particularly material or quantitative around overall profitability, even our iCELLis product line, which is doing exceptionally well. It's still early days and its market penetration as fast as that pickup has been and as unique of that product is in the market. So more to come over time, but in general, our outlook is profitability looks very solid across this market. Zolgensma as you mentioned, you probably know from what's been publicized is a unique therapy, is a breakthrough, it's incredibly impactful to children under the age of two, and it's a very costly therapy. And that's a challenge in healthcare today is the cost of developing therapies and so on. But that's a dynamic that where quite a number of steps removed from when it comes to drug pricing and the relationship with the payers. And so I think the continued evolution of the technologies associated with these breakthroughs is going to be imperative for our customers today and we're proud to be a part of it, but we certainly recognize the challenges that are associated with how costly these have become. Just one last point, that many of you have probably heard me say that at Danaher, we have a, what we call our shared purpose and it's four simple words, helping realize life's potential, whether that's the potential for our associates or our customers, our shareholders. Ultimately in many respect patients and there's probably no better example of how we help realize life's potential when it comes to healthcare than when a tool of ours can play a role in really impacting the quality of life for patients. So we're proud to be a part of that and there is more to come and it's still early days.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.
Tom Joyce: Hey Dough.
Doug Schenkel: Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to touch base to start on a few loose ends on Pall. How would you characterize win rates for Pall biotech, especially in the gene therapy space? I guess the second part is, I believe it was last quarter, you mentioned some building backlog for iCELLis, what's the status of that? And I guess the third part is, I'm curious if customer anticipation of the GE Bio acquisition is having any impact on Pall demand, clearly you're doing well there and you have been for a while, but just wondering if there is any attribution to anticipation of the GE Bio deal as customers think about the possibilities associated with you having a broader portfolio? And whether or not that is impacting demand at all?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Doug. So first of all on Pall around win rates in gene therapy, and you mentioned specifically iCELLis and that's a good place to start when it comes to gene therapy. iCELLis is a unique product, not to suggest that there is only one way to affect what iCELLis affects in terms of bioreactor, but its capabilities are particularly unique in the market and as a result of that the leaders in that market segment associated with the projection steps in gene therapy have chosen iCELLis at a pretty consistent rate. And so, while I won't begin to quote right now a specific win rate percentage. I would tell you, it's just, it's very high and that has to do with the unique capabilities that iCELLis delivers in this market that is, it's difficult to do with the quality and the efficiency and the cost effectiveness that iCELLis allows for. So we feel very good about that, but again it's still because the gene and cell therapy market is still nascent today. We can feel great about that but the materiality of that is something that will only build over time. It will build at a reasonably rapid rate, but again a nascent market today. Your question specifically about the customer reaction or anticipation I guess as you framed it for the GE deal and impacting of Pall demand. I don't know today that we would point to anything specific in that regard, Doug. I would tell you quick sort of an anecdote,I was in China a couple of months ago and was it was with a significant Pall customer. They happen to be a GE customer as well as most large customers that I might meet with either in China or any high-growth market or even in the U.S. or Europe. But in this particular case, it was, there was an appreciation for the fact that the combination of those two businesses in terms of the type of service and support that that customer would expect, the fact that we become more meaningful to one another in a positive and constructive way was something that they feel very good about. And so those are just anecdotes. I don't know if there's anything we would point to today that is a demand impact today that we could see into relative to the top line.
Doug Schenkel: Thank you for that. Beckman diagnostic where you guys grew mid single digits for the third consecutive quarter. Do you think this is the new norm and specifically in North America there is clearly been some improvement there over the last couple of quarters. How did that flare in North America for this quarter for Beckman Dx?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Doug. And we obviously as that's an important battleground we paid a good deal of attention to that. As you said third straight quarter of mid single-digit growth. We feel very good about that. Some of the things that led the way are we continue to see very good growth in our immunoassay business in the core Central Lab. You'll recall that we had, we've developed and launched a new automation system the DxH system which has taken our competitive advantage in particularly high volume accounts to a new level. And so we feel very good about that, but probably one of the key things that is a difference today is our hematology business. And for those you Doug and others who follow us for a number of years, that even going back to the acquisition of Beckman to begin with hematology with the headwind. And so we made a significant amount of investment in new product development. We have transformed that product line. Those new products specifically around of both high and mid volume specifically in the high volume the DxH 900 as well as the early sepsis indicator capabilities that we have now launched are contributing together to turn the tide. We continually look at retention and win rates and we have seen those increment upward consistently over the last, particularly over the last two years and those new products around automation and hematology have clearly been a big part of it. China continues to be a strong driver for us at north of 10%. And so that's a plus as well. So the combination, still work to do, there is still minute gaps that we're working on that we – couple of critical ones that we will look to close more likely in 2020. And so I think we're continuing to see good performance. I think if you step back, just for one second and think about the impact this has had on the diagnostic platform. If you think about the improvement in Beck Dx now at mid-single digits with the addition of Cepheid now with its terrific performance . We now have a diagnostic platform with core growth at 7.5% that we think will as the comps come out will stack up reasonably well and now a platform that's been solidly mid-single digits for eight straight quarters. So I think Beckman is important certainly with the combination of Beckman with solid performance at Radiometer like the biosystems, and the high growth rate at Cepheid is really what solidified that stronger overall platform position and it's really the platform together. When we look at clinical chemistry immunoassay, hematology, urinalysis, microbiology and across the other modalities in anatomical pathology in acute care, that really is the right comp against some pretty good competitors.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Sorry to try to sneak in one more and then I'll like fall back to the queue. [indiscernible] No, this is all me. I've got a handful of investors ask me for updates on timing of the debt financing and if there is any real change and I think by extension upside what you guys embedded into your original deal model for interest expense assumptions. Could you speak to timing and whether there is any change in how you're thinking about maybe upside associated with interest expense? Thank you.
MattMcGrew: Sure. Yeah, I mean from a timing perspective, I still think we've kind of talked about trying to be in the market a little bit closer to when we closed. I mean I think we're still talking about a Q4 close here. So I think that the timing will be a little bit closer to that, but as Tom kind of said, we talked about the GE update we issued the equity in Q1 and the debt financing here is clearly going to be held by the lower rates. There is no question about that. I mean, we're probably not going to update any of our guidance that we kind of provide to you earlier. But I think the combination of the tailwinds that the businesses – the GE business is off to a pretty good start and where the rates are right now, like we will have some sort of benefit. But I think from a timing perspective, still sort of TBD but a little bit closer to when we bring the kind of when we get to close here.
Doug Schenkel: Thanks again.
Matt McGrew: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.
Tom Joyce: Good morning Steve.
Steve Beuchaw: Good morning. Thanks so much for the time here. Just a couple from me. I mean a couple of clarifications for Matt and then one on the commercial side for Tom. Matt, it sounds like the thinking for the core growth of the total company level is going higher relative to what we had before, is it fair to say that that, well, fair to say that first of all. And second of all, is that a reflection of a fairly balanced view across Environmental, Applied Diagnostics, Life Sciences. Second clarification for Matt is, has anything meaningfully changed in terms of non-op or tax rate outlook for the full year that you would flag here? And then I have one for Tom.
Matt McGrew: Sure. So from guide perspective, I think for the full year, we had talked about at the beginning of the year, kind of, in December, we had talked about approximately 4% core for the whole year. Obviously, a pretty good start here with – in the first half and what we are – our guide here of approximately 4.5% in Q3. So I think from a full-year perspective, our thoughts now are that we are probably approximately 5% here for the full year from a core guide. As far as – balance on that. Yeah, I think, where we've seen in the first half as you see Life Sciences and Diagnostics have been much better and EAS, I think EAS would be the one piece in the second half given the water comp and the comp at PID, they are both here in Q3, going to be comping kind of their toughest comps in the quarter. But other than that, I suspect that it's been pretty balanced, I don't think we see a vast difference here in the first half or the second half, I think we just have had a little bit better start than we may have thought in December. As far as non-op stuff in tax, I don't think there's anything that I would call out, Steve, that would be different here in the second half.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay. Thanks, Matt. And then Tom, I wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on IDT and now that business in isolation. But what IDT in the broader life science portfolio is doing in terms of cross-selling opportunities. There's probably some synergy between IDT and Beck LS just to pick one example and just would be interested to hear about where you think you might be doing better in terms of share gains, not just as a function of the commercial investments, you've made. But in terms of product synergies whether it's around IDT or may be Phenomenex, as we've been hearing more about Phenomenex on checks here of late. Thanks so much.
Matt McGrew: Sure, Steve. It probably will come across as somewhat surprising that despite what you might think across a broad set of analytical modalities that we provide in Life Sciences that there aren't a really significant number of cross-selling situations that we would point to that where there's real materiality. And the reason for that and I'll come back to IDT in a second. But the reason for that is that our operating company-centric model that we have maintained for virtually the entirety of Danaher's history is one that puts an extremely high value on an individual operating company and its commercial organizations being uniquely focused on the specific needs of that customer set. And we've seen a number of situations looking across different industries, where businesses have hoped for commercial synergies by bringing sales organizations together and creating heavier bags for their commercial organizations, thinking that customers actually were looking to buy a broader suite of instrumentation from the same sales team. When the reality is that only serve to dilute the focus, the technical capability, the level of service and support. And so we've actually maintained much more focus within our individual operating companies on the unique needs of that end-market's customers and really I think continue to maintain that even, in particular with newly acquired businesses. Going back to IDT, that approach to maintaining a unique focus of a commercial organization on their unique customers is particularly important for newly acquired businesses for us, because it's so easy to get the commercial organization confused by adding additional products to their bags from another operating company that ultimately dilutes that sales force's effectiveness, and so we look clearly for situations, where we can deliver higher value, I think you mentioned Phenomenex. Phenomenex and SCIEX are clearly a closer opportunity, where the synergy between chromatography column obviously and the sample preparation associated with mass spectrometry is much more technically and workflow oriented synergistic and so that's probably a better example of where we see that. And then in certain cases in high growth markets, I think I would point for example to our Dental business, where having a unified sales organization, bringing a consolidated set of products to a single end market, meaning the dental market in China, which has structured a little bit differently than the end markets in the developed countries. That's really delivered value and that's actually one of the things that has helped drive that double-digit sales growth in China, but again those are unique situations that we only do that where there is clarity around how we bring real value to customers.
Steve Beuchaw: Well, that's great color. I really appreciate the time here this morning.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Thank you. I will now return the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing comments.

Tom Joyce: Thanks Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2019 delivering first quarter results ahead of our expectations. We achieved 5.5% core revenue growth, and believe we expanded our market leading positions at a number of our operating companies through a combination of new product innovation and strong commercial execution. Our growth was broad-based with all four segments delivering better than expected results, and we continue to see healthy conditions across our major end markets. Combined with solid adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow generation, our performance is a testament to the power of the Danaher business system. Our team's focus execution is continued to accelerate our growth trajectory and drive long-term value creation. And we're excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. Over the past few years, you've heard us talk a lot about building a better, stronger Danaher. An important and transformational component in that pursuit is our pending acquisition of the GE Biopharma business, which we announced on February 25th. GE Biopharma is a leading global player in the attractive biologics production market and will bring complementary strengths to our life sciences platform across the bio processing workflow. We expect this acquisition will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels, and will further advance our evolution into a higher growth innovation-driven company. We could not be more excited about this business, the team and what they'll bring to Danaher. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals. And we're making good progress towards closing, which we continue to be -- which continues to be on track for the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $4.9 billion, driven by 5.5% core growth. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 4%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in China. Across the developed markets, we saw mid single-digit growth in the U.S. and low single-digit growth in Western Europe. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.7%, and operating profit margin was 14.8%. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. Excluding this foreign currency impact, core operating margin would have been up 90 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.07 representing 8% growth year-on-year Now let's take a more detailed look at our first quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 10% and core revenue grew 7%. Reported operating profit margin was up 60 basis points to 19% with core margins increasing by 100 basis points. Segment life sciences core revenue was up double digits making this the business' seventh consecutive quarter of high single-digit or better core revenue growth. Broad based strength across most major regions and product lines was led by double-digit growth in flow cytometry and sanctification. Ad we believe the team's combination of high quality innovation plus commercial execution continue to drive market share gains across the business. Leica Microsystems achieved high single-digit core revenue growth. Strength across North America and China was driven by demand in life science research as we continue to benefit from new product introductions. Most recently Leica launched the THUNDER Imaging Systems, a new class of wide field instruments designed specifically for high speed, high quality imaging of 3D biology. Scientists used this imaging technology to study organisms, tissue sections and advanced cell cultures for use in microbiology, neuroscience and cancer research. Core revenue at SCIEX was up low single digits with good performance in pharmaceutical, academic and applied markets, partially offset by the impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business, which was up meaningfully last year. Pall's core revenue increased at a high single-digit rate with growth across all major geographies. Pall Industrial was up mid single-digits led by aerospace and process and industrial, and we continue to see solid order trends within both businesses. Double digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences was driven by our biotech business, particularly single use technologies where we're seeing robust demand for our iCELLis bioreactor system in gene therapy applications. The iCELLis provided excellent cell growth conditions for adherent cells, which are used to produce gene therapies. And it is the most widely used cell adherent bioreactor on the market today. iCELLis was recently highlighted at the Interphex Bioproduction Trade Show along with the number of Pall's other market leading bioprocessing innovations. Moving to diagnostics. Reported revenue grew 1% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin decreased to 15.2% with both core and reported margins down 110 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue was up mid single-digits, as we saw continued improvement in North America and double-digit growth in China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. And in hematology, we're seeing early sign of the positive impact from our new product introductions, including the DxH 520 and DxH 900 analyzers for low to high volume settings. Beckman recently received 510K clearance from the U.S. FDA for the DxH 520 and for the Early Sepsis Indicator to be run on the DxH 900. These additions in hematology are key examples how we're enhancing our competitive position and accelerating our growth trajectory assessments. Radiometer delivered high single-digit core revenue growth led by performance in China. And we believe this team continued to gain market share in North America. During the quarter, Radiometer expanded their install base globally across both our blood gas and AQT product lines. We acquired Radiometer in early 2004. And the first quarter marked their 15th anniversary as part of Danaher. During that time, the team has become a champion of DBS helping to evolve the tools and processes that are shared across Danaher today. As a result of this strong DBS execution and leadership, Radiometer has achieved tremendous results, including more than 1,000 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. And over the last five years, the business has averaged high single-digit core revenue growth compared to low single-digit growth at the time of acquisition. As one of our longest tenured operating companies today, Radiometer provides a terrific example of the long-term power of DBS. Through a balanced approach, implementing growth, lean and leadership tools, Radiometer has established a market leading position that it continues to enhance today. Leica Biosystems also had an excellent start to the year with core revenue up high single-digits led by Advanced Staining and core histology across the developed markets and in China. At Cepheid, core growth was down slightly against the prior year comparison of over 40% growth, which is primarily driven by last year's severe flu season. The team continued to expand Cepheid's market leading installed base, and is gaining momentum in North America with Integrated Delivery Networks or IDNs. Cepheid cartridge based molecular test is a uniquely well suited solution for IDN and their patients as it ensures consistent results across the network, whether the test is done in a large hospital lab or in a physician's office. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 2%, while core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating profit margins declined to 7.3% with both core and reported margins down 30 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. We saw growth across our specialty and traditional product lines. And we remain encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in the North American end markets. High growth markets led the way geographically with China up double-digits. The Dental team continues to pursue one of its key strategic priorities. That is accelerating growth through innovation. At two recent industry trade shows IDS and Chicago Midwinter, we featured more than 20 new products and technologies from across the Dental platform, really the culmination of strategic investments in R&D and sales and marketing over the last few years. At Nobel, Xeal and TiUltra are new implant surface technologies that enable better bone and tissue integration, while improving aesthetic results. And the KaVo OP 3D is a scalable modular imaging system that provides clinicians with the flexibility to upgrade to the latest 3D imaging technology as they expand their capabilities and grow their practices. So we're excited about the cadence of new production introductions, and believe that with expanding portfolio solutions we’ll further distinguish our Dental business going forward. We're also making good progress as we work to establish the platform as a separate publicly traded company in the second half of this year. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions Segment. Reported revenue increased 3% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.2% with 140 basis points of core margin expansion due to outstanding execution across the segment. In product identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up mid single-digits led by results in the developed markets. Growth was broad-based across all major product lines with good traction for newly introduced products like the remotely connected CIJ 1580 industrial inkjet printer. Using DDS growth and innovation tools, Videojet has continuously expanded its product portfolio and getting higher impact products to market faster. This growing innovation execution differentiates Videojet's customer solutions and is a key driver of the team's consistent market outperformance. Core revenue in our packaging business, which includes Esko and X-Rite was flat, but recent order trends are improving, and we expect better performance as we move through the year. Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth for the platform was up high single-digits. Hach core revenue increased at a mid single-digit rates as end market demand remained healthy. Europe and China led the way. And we continue to see solid order trends across both municipal and industrial applications globally. Hach is consistently growing above the market over the last several years, in part driven by best-in-class commercial execution. The team has aligned their go-to-market strategy to better meet customers' needs. And a great example of this is the expansion of Hach's e-commerce platform. The team's double-digit e-commerce revenue growth in the quarter is a testament to how our innovative commercial strategy is delivering even greater value to customers. At Trojan, core revenue increased by more than 20% as a result of a few large municipal projects in North America and in China. The team sustained a solid customer win rates and continues to benefit from recent new product introductions like UVSigma and UVFlex. Lastly, ChemTreat delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth with the team's sales execution driving strong performance in North America by end market, chemicals, metal processing and oil and gas led the way.  So, to wrap up, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year. Our team's commitment to continuous improvement helped us achieve our sixth consecutive quarter of 5.5% or better core revenue growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and solid operating margin expansion. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.13 and $1.16, which assumes core growth of approximately 4% to 5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.80, which reflects the dilutive impacts of our recent equity offerings, partially offset by our first quarter performance. Looking ahead, 2019 will be a transformational year for Danaher. We will be welcoming the GE Biopharma business to our Life Sciences platform and are establishing our Dental platform as a separate publicly traded company. These are incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect will maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates, and help all of us realize greater potential. With DBS as our foundation, we're well positioned to continue building on our growth trajectory and are excited about the opportunities to come.
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Want to start with China. You guys continue to put up really good numbers there. We've had some interesting data points slightly. One of your peers talked about destocking on the diagnostic side yesterday. And then, there's been more noise on the crackdown on generics kind of impacting the pharma market. So can you maybe just looking ahead talk a little bit about how your expectations for China have evolved? And are you seeing any headwinds from either of the dynamics?
Tom Joyce: Tycho, we actually feel really good about where we are in China right now, double-digit growth across the businesses, this by the way with the ninth consecutive quarter. And I think what's most encouraging in this the growth that we're seeing is broad based. All four of our segments were up double-digits in the first quarter. So whether you look at Diagnostics or Life Sciences, the Dental platform, certainly water quality everybody, I think doing a nice job by driving the four segments to double-digits in the quarter. I think, if we look at anything where there might be a little bit of slowness, I think I'd probably point to PID, Product ID over the past couple of quarters, but not in the sense of a meaningful step down. And of course, PID is only about roughly 5% of our China revenues. So we feel very good about how we're positioned. And these end markets, as you know well, are our terrific end markets to be in China. So over the span of time three to -- last three to four years, we've been high single-digits to low double-digit kind of across the board. Could we see a little bit of softness in the second half? I think that would only be a function right now related to the comps that we have, particularly in water. I think Q -- middle of the year to back end of the year, our water business was up greater than 25%. So I think that will be a tough comp. But in terms of the fundamentals, in China right now, and I -- by the way, Tycho, I was just there. I was there two weeks ago and met really one of our teams, spent some time with customers, talking with our -- certainly DS customers in the hospital market as well as in bioprocessing. And that the tone was really quite good. So I think we feel good about the markets. We feel good about our position in those markets. You asked about generics. We understand there is some policy moves uplift there. That has -- can have impact on pricing, at the same time we may have an impact on access and volumes. And generally we benefit from expanding access and volumes. But we're not that dynamic that we're really in the crosshairs of. We would be a second or third derivative of how we might actually benefit from expansion of generics in that market. So those will be our thoughts.
Matt McGrew: Yes. And Tycho, besides your earlier question on the diagnostics, we clearly are not seeing bad dynamic from the destocking perspective either.
Tycho Peterson: And then on Beckman, you're continuing to put up great numbers there. Obviously, you've had a couple of competitive launches. One of your peers talked about, I think two thirds of competitive accounts in Europe at this point. Maybe you just talk about your confidence in holding share. I know you're going to have a product refresh at some point. But just talk a little bit about chemistry and immunoassay and your ability to hold shares there. And then any metrics you can put on customer retention rates with the new hematology systems and now your confidence in that driving growth?
Tom Joyce: Sure Tycho. We continue to have an ever improving cadence of new product introductions at Beckman. Hematology is going to a big step forward in that. It's been one of the areas that where we've had a challenge over years since we acquired the business. But we think we've stabilized that and really around the cusp of starting to improve our position there on a more material basis. If we look at what the flow of new products that are coming on the core clinical chemistry and immunoassay side, we feel very good about those products, particularly how they will enhance our competitiveness in low and mid-volumes environment, and we'll see those really over the next year to two years. Those will also come with enhanced menus as there have been a couple of menu gaps over time. Those are new products. Those new architectures will also bring along enhanced menus that will improve our competitiveness. So we feel very good about that. We've always led the way in larger volume environments, particularly with automation. We've even stepped up our automation gain recently with the introduction of the DxH line of automation equipment. And so, I think the combination of the products that have just come to the market more recently, the recent FDA approval, also our clearances, and those that are coming over the next year to two years, I think we feel very good about improving the trajectory of Beckman from a core growth perspective. And you see that in the numbers this quarter, saw the numbers last quarter. If you look at the overall diagnostic platform of which Beckman obviously is a big part, now putting up 6% core growth in the past. And in that 5% to 6% range now with little bit more consistency, we feel very good about that. And of course, that was against the very tough comp of a quarter ago. Relative to metrics that we track, we do track retention and win rates very carefully across our businesses, Beckman included. We don't publish those numbers. But I can tell you that we look at those numbers consistently every month and we see a continuing improving trend and have for some time now in both retention and win rates.
Tycho Peterson: One very quick one from a group before I hop off my comments to. So I would ask on GE Biopharma. How much actual free cash flow is this business generating?
Matt McGrew: They're generating about $1 billion or so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: Just one quick question. Did you see any sort of impact at all in the U.S. from the government shutdown earlier in the year?
Tom Joyce: No. Well, we saw it in traffic, I mean, in Washington, out my window in Pennsylvania Avenue. Everybody loves being able to get to work a lot faster. But in all seriousness, no, we can't point to anything in the shutdown. That would be of any consequence at all. Of course, we don't -- we have -- to say almost zero. I tell you that almost zero revenue that actually is directly attached to federal government activity. At most we are linked to funding that comes from the federal government to NIH, and then out from NIH into the broader Life Science market. But in terms of any direct linkage to federal government spending, I would say, I would say none at all.
Derik De Bruin : So can you elaborate a little bit more on the diagnostics operating margin? I mean your -- all your businesses have essentially the same -- essentially, the same FX. So what was it about -- what is it about your diagnostic mix that took the corporative margin down in this quarter from FX whereas the other segments and you saw good expansion in EAS and good expansion in the life sciences?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Well, there's a couple of factors going on there. You have, first of all, the FX and tariffs together. And so when you take those kind of things, you'd -- FX and tariffs alone would bring those otherwise negative OMX numbers up to, probably flat or maybe even a hair above that. And then there's a little bit of a mix component that was going on there. Obviously, Cepheid's operating leverage that we had last year coming off of greater than 40% core growth. And then add to that, Beckman DX improving the mid single-digits at somewhat lower margins, obviously, you get the combination of those two factors Cepheid against Beck DX. And then some targeted investment spend, no question we continue to ramp up our new product spending at Beck Dx, as well as Cepheid. So I think it's a really a combination of those things. But as we look forward, those, certainly, the FX and tariff headwinds will continue a little bit in Q2, but as you look into the second half of the year, we'll see better OMX in the second half, for sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore.
Ross Muken: So maybe on the biopharma side, and it feels like across number of parts of the business that end market customer vertical remains quite robust. It seem like Pall had quite good growth in the quarter on what's, I think, increasingly tough comp, so strong underlying. I guess, how are you thinking about sort of that end market broadly? And then, in terms of Pall, specifically, in terms of sustaining kind of the elevated growth we've seen, you feel like, you've got pretty good visibility on that remaining kind of these kind of high single-digit, low double-digit kind of levels on the biotech side?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Let's start with the overall market. In general, the life science end markets remain very good. And we put up 7% core growth across our life science businesses in Q1, so another really strong quarter. This is a fourth straight quarter of a high single-digit growth across our life science businesses. And we're making -- it happen organically through better innovation at each one of the businesses, more innovative new products launched on time, commercialized effectively, and some tremendous investments in taking our products to market in each one of the businesses. And that's, by the way without IDT being core. IDT goes core here in this quarter, and they're off to a terrific start and really beating our initial expectations. So I think the combination of our good execution in fundamentally solid end markets sets up really well for continued performance in life sciences. We continue to see good performance across the biopharma end market, our single use technologies. And the work that we're doing around continuous bioprocessing is garnered tremendous interest in the end marketing. And we're seeing sales continue to grow in those areas, but applied markets have been solid, academic and research has been solid, and even the smaller portions of sort of the industrially oriented life science market has been solid as well. Geographically, China, as you've heard me mentioned already, continuous strong U.S. a good quarter. And Europe, I would say is stable, but that the markets that we're watching closely. And it's held up so far. But there are always some concerns about what's going on in Europe at the moment. So we're watching that carefully. In terms of Pall going a little deeper there, we have very good visibility to the product development pipelines of both large and small pharma customers and biotechs. We continue to work those early stage opportunities well. And I think that's what bodes very well for continuing this high single-digit growth across Pall and the double-digit growth across our biotech business around SET, continuous bioprocessing. And really innovative products like the iCELLis bioreactor that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So overall, it's the -- that end markets good placed to be right now.
Ross Muken: And maybe just on Dental, obviously, we see in the margin a little bit more investment there but the growth albeit an easier comp kind of improved. I guess how are you thinking, in general, about sort of the trajectory there and kind of what you put into the business and sort of types of investments that are being made now ahead of sort of the potential separation?
Tom Joyce: Sure. We're very encouraged, actually to see the better top line performance that we put up and the underlying market stabilization that that underpins some of that. But our performance we believe, beyond the market stabilization has really been driven by the new product innovation that we continue to invest in, as well as some of the investments around commercialization. Some of those investments are really specific to things like our clear aligner program and our intraoral scanner and a number of new products that I mentioned earlier around Nobel. And so these are -- we believe these are really important investments to be made strategically to set this business up for success. If we look at the quarter, we saw sellout continue to be pretty encouraging, and that's pretty broad based. Even more encouraging, I think around the traditional consumables and equipment, which had struggled in the past, and where we had adjusted inventories with the channel in the past. Now channel inventories are really in good shape. So I think we combined those investments with and improved cost structure that we worked so hard to establish. And you heard me talk about this before about how we rationalize the cost structure around the overall footprint of the business over the last three to four years. I think we'll continue to see some incremental improvements in the growth rates, and particularly in the second half around core operating margins. So I think, second straight quarter a solid low single-digit core growth and a little better than our expectations. And I think we're positioning the business well for later in the year.
Ross Muken: And quick one, Matt, it looked like with the dilution from the equity deal, net sort of the deep, the underlying operating guide, you actually came up. I don't know maybe a $0.05 or so. I guess, if we think about the Q1 being fairly balanced top and margin line, is there anything notable in terms of that delta, and in terms any of the segments or if it's more an organic versus OMX type tweak?
Matt McGrew: No. I think your frame of kind of talking about kind of got the -- for the full year, the change being kind of $0.09 of dilution from the equity offering, kind of offset by that $0.04 beat. And that $0.04 beat is very operational, was pretty broad across most of our segments, I think came in better than we thought here. So, yes, that $0.05 reduction, I think is the way to think about it is that it's $0.09 of dilution offset by $0.04 operational beat here in the quarter. Yes, kind of results if you take a step back, and we kind of look at it, we're going to have EPS growth here for the full year, call it 6%, 7% now. And effectively, we've got all the dilution from the equity issuance kind of behind us as we get into the second quarter.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Maybe just building off of Ross's last question, Q1 core growth was 5.5%, and you expect core growth of 4% to 5% in the second quarter against a tougher year-over-year comparison. While Q3 has another tough comp you get an extra selling day in Q4. I understand why you might not want to provide a formal update to top line guidance given we're only two weeks into the second quarter and only around three months into the year. And that's said, I haven't heard anything coming off of a strong Q1 that would suggest there's any change in positive trend or that there were any transitory issues that made Q1 uniquely strong. So mathematically, it does seem like you're on track to exceed your original full year core revenue growth guidance of 4% by at least 50 odd basis points, if not a little bit more. Is there anything I'm missing here?
Matt McGrew: No, I mean, I think like you said, we're very encouraged by Q1. The underlying market does remain good. I don't think we would dispute that. But kind of that being said, like we've talked about before, we are -- as you mentioned we are three months, and we typically like to kind of get through the second quarter here. We'll kind of comeback folks in July. Talk to the second half of the full year. We'll kind of update everybody there. We've done that last couple of years, and that's worked out well. So clearly, we feel good about where we're at. But we're going to kind of do that again and we update everybody in July here.
Doug Schenkel: The second topic is SCIEX. I was hoping to get a bit more color on performance in the quarter. I believe you indicated growth moderated to low single-digit levels if I heard that correctly. So it -- one way the other would be helpful to get a bit more color on product mix, geographic trends and recognizing your bid under index to bio pharma within this business relative to peers. It would be good to hear how demand in that end market shaped up in the quarter. And then looking ahead, I think you noted that you were up against the tough clinical comp within this business, but that's said SCIEX grew at least high single-digits every quarter last year. I'm just wondering if you are expecting continued moderation in SCIEX growth over the balance of the year, if you expect this to pick up.
Tom Joyce: I think you've got most of the facts. We did have a tough comp overall. We were high single-digits, in fact, in the first quarter, a year ago. And at this point, we're sort of coming off our fourth straight quarter, as you know, of high single-digit core growth. It was, as I mentioned, largely driven by pretty meaningful declines in clinical market, which is skewed towards North America. And that was up meaningfully in the first quarter of '18. So we can kind of do the direct comp to those to that particular -- our end markets. The other end markets are generally pretty solid. The farmer market really pretty good. If we look geographically, that market is pretty solid on a global basis. The applied markets are good. That's kind of a food testing oriented market. There's sort of a nascent market around cannabis testing where that we expect to grow over time, and the academic markets pretty good. So I think aside from that challenging comp around clinical, we feel pretty good about where we sit relative to those end markets. We have a broader footprint today with Phenomenex in separations consumables. That business was up mid single-digits. And our service business, which has always been an important part of both growth and margin expansion at SCIEX, continues to be good as well, generally tracking high single-digits to low single-digits. So we feel good about how that business is positioned despite that tough comp. And I think we'll see some improvement over time.
Matt McGrew: Yes, Doug, we're like Tom just said, and we are kind of expecting here kind of mid single-digit for the second quarter and the balance of the year here from an outlook perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank.
Dan Leonard: Hello, I will stick with a question on the tools business. So first off, you mentioned strengths in flow cytometry and centrifugation and Beckman tools. Can you flag for me, what are the applications driving that strengths? And I'm specifically wondering if there's any play here on some of the cell therapies that you're seeing strength and other parts of your platform?
Tom Joyce: Sure, Dan. In terms of flow cytometry, the real strength of that business is around leukemia and lymphomas. And I think the combination of our historical technologies with the more breakthrough technologies that have been associated with our acquisition just a few years ago of Xitogen that is now led to the innovations embedded in our CytoFLEX product line. The combination of those strong application areas with more novel technologies have really helped to drive the flow cytometry business pretty consistently. It's been a key growth driver for Beck LS for a number of quarters. Centrifugation is a much more broadly defined set of applications. We play in a number of different segments from an end market perspective. And it was an architecture that's generally oriented towards higher volumes, certainly above the table top kinds of volumes. And, but I wouldn't attribute centrifugation purely to any particular end market. I think the team's done a nice job with innovation around centrifugation. They've done a nice job in terms of positioning their commercial organization more effectively in terms of being able to take those products to market more broadly across that fragmented end market. And I think those are the underlying sources of growth at Beck LS.
Dan Leonard: And just a quick follow up. Can you offer us the Cepheid growth rate in the quarter, excluding the flu comp? And is it safe to assume that that business gets back to double-digit growth in Q2 and beyond?
Tom Joyce: Yes. So if you think about Cepheid, excluding kind of flu in the high growth markets HBDC stuff, it was up double-digits.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse.
Erin Wright: So on the Dental side, do you think we're at an inflection point here? Have you seen stabilization continuing quarter-to-date? And can you breakdown the trends that you're seeing across both North America and rest of the world what's driving more growth? And if you could just give us an update on the timeline of the spin, when we should hear more about your outlook for remain co business, et cetera? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Erin, I don't know that I would call this an inflection point. I think we've seen now over at least the last two, maybe even three quarters of progressing level of stabilization. And when we measure that stabilization in terms of some things that caused some disruption in the past, a series of adjustments in the channel relative to exclusive relationships between manufacturers and distributors, some disruption among some channel sales forces, some inventory bill that needed to be rectified, all of those things really over -- that was a really over a couple year period, I think, evolved to a point where we now have a much more stable end market. And we're seeing that both in terms of the alignment between our sell-in and sell-out through the channel, we look at it in terms of inventories, we look at it by category to see how the traditional consumables and equipment are trending versus the more specialized products. And so, in general, I would say the overall trend in the market today could certainly be called a far more stable than it was a year or two ago. In terms of the broader trends that are happening in the market, I would say continued move towards what would be broadly described as digital dentistry, the importance of imaging systems, and particularly -- and that's an area where our KaVo Kerr business is real leader in imaging technologies. And the linkage of those imaging technologies through software to treatment planning and treatment execution with important novel innovations happening in term, in the specialty areas, our implant business around Nobel continues to be a leader in those areas, where digital dentistry really matters, where imaging leads to treatment planning, leads to novel implant systems and procedures that end up with greater levels of patient satisfaction. And I think that's a broad based trend, not just in North America, but really on a global basis. I think the other thing that’s certainly noteworthy is the emerging middle class, and the importance of dentistry in our in high growth markets. China being one, we've talked a lot about being double digits. But we're going to see good growth across our Dental platform in a number of markets where an emerging middle class is putting greater demands on the practice of dentistry.  And then finally, around your question around the timeline of the spin, we remain focused on the timeline as we've laid it out, which is to affect that spin late this year. The intention is to launch an IPO of that business. And that was largely be a business that would probably put 19.9% of that -- of that equity into the market. And we would retain of the balance that for a period of time. And so there's been no change to those plans.
Erin Wright: And then this is a bigger picture kind of broader question, just there has been a lot of volatility in the market, primarily to speak alone, just on reimbursement, regulatory kind of concepts here in the U.S., and regardless of the actual likelihood of anything actually being implemented. How do you think about some of the opportunities, risk factors across your business? When it comes to some of these concepts related to reimbursement pressures, drug pricing scrutiny, more recently PAMA, for instance. What are you seeing there? And are there -- is there anything that you're more meaningfully concerned about from a reimbursement perspective that could impact your business or your customer base? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: To cut right to a simple answer to your question about, are we incrementally concerned about something around the dynamics that you just mentioned. The answer would be no. Yes, there are lots of things being bandied about around healthcare and reimbursement today and the Affordable Care Act, those at the moment are not having any material impact on us whatsoever, or immaterial impact. PAMA, we’ve seen occasional impacts of that. But then again, price pressures are our standard operating procedure in the diagnostic markets. I think, Erin, probably you step back from our business for a moment, and you think about what we do in diagnostics, providing diagnostic capabilities to hospitals in the central laboratory, in anatomical pathology, in acute care, in the emergency room, in molecular diagnostics for acutely ill patients around infectious disease. Diagnostics today represents about 2% of costs of healthcare broadly defined. And yet it informs well north of 60% of the decisions that are ultimately made in healthcare today. So we play a vital role in the overall market, but are relatively small portion of the overall cost structure. And while the factors that you mentioned are very important for us to attend to keep in mind, and be aware of any potential impacts. Today there hasn't been any meaningful change in any of those in the recent quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard: Tom just a follow up on the Dental business. Any chance you could tease out the performance of the traditional portfolio versus the specialty lines in the first quarter and then, specifically curious how the U.S. consumables business did in the period?
Tom Joyce: I think pretty solid, as I mentioned, second straight quarter of low single-digit growth across the platform. So we feel pretty good about all of that. The orthodontics business was up mid single-digits. And we see really good performance across those businesses. Nobel was up low single-digits, but on a tougher Q1 comp, but still mid single-digits on a 2-year stack basis, and generally in line with what we've seen the last couple of years. I think in both of these cases, around specialty consumables, we're making significant investments in new product innovation. Obviously, around clear liners and then the digital support through intraoral scanners that will really make a difference in our orthodontics business over time. We have new Damon level, Damon line products that have been introduced into the market as well. And then at Nobel, these new surface technologies are exciting new technologies that are going to make a difference over time. And so, I think today those businesses are tracking reasonably well, but we're really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out in both of them. North American traditional consumables and equipment remain good, low single-digit growth with a reasonably stable market. The imaging business, as the trends are good. We're seeing mid single-digit growth around imaging. And when we look at sell-out, the sell-out looks pretty solid. So we're continuing to manage sell-in to make sure the channel inventories are in line. So we don't have that kind of disruption in the future. And I think, overall, we feel pretty good about where the Dental platform fits today.
Brandon Couillard: And so maybe a follow-up for Matt. EAS segment continues to be pretty solid, pricing up 1.5 in the period. Can you talk about the sustainability of that and where that's coming from? And secondly, what do you think pricing might improve somewhat of the Dental business? And what's been, I guess about five quarters of weakness on Dental pricing?
Matt McGrew: Yes, that's -- I was going to say general kind of in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure that we've got anything intentional that is driving that in Dental. So that seems to kind of be the runway of where they operate here today. So I'm not sure there's kind of an inflection or change that's necessarily being planned for Dental. As far as EAS goes, yes, they do a very nice job in pricing. I think it's -- both of those businesses have been around a little bit longer than some of our other businesses. And we talked about kind of some of the things that they're able to do and passing through some of the prices that they get. So I'm not sure there's anything from a trend perspective there that will change either. I think we've seen price there in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure a whole lot that was new here in the quarter from price perspective.
Operator: We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Brennan of UBS.
Daniel Brennan: I wanted to ask first starting on GE. If you could share some -- maybe some of the early customer feedback that you're receiving, I mean should that learn if some of the customers look at the combined Danaher and GE offerings, possibly providing some share gains to be possible broader solutions provider?
Tom Joyce: Our team has spent expensive time with customers. We obviously share quite a number of customers. And we also the opportunity in situations where we don't share customers to potentially bring a broader portfolio of solutions to that end market. I was actually, as I mentioned earlier in my comment, I was actually in China last week or two weeks ago, and actually met with the -- one of the key customers in the end market. And I think they represent sort of broadly a view across that market of real enthusiasm. GE does a tremendous job in the China market as does our Pall business. And I think the opportunities that those end customers see today are for really innovative solutions where we can bring a broader perspective to the overall bioproduction workflow, and work collaboratively with them to ensure that we meet not only their needs of today, but the needs that they'll have as their capacity expands over time. And as they evolve their processes, more towards single use technologies and more towards continuous bioprocessing capabilities. They see the combination of the broad set of tools that we bring at Danaher not just associated with Pall, but across the broader portfolio, and then inclusive of GE is being something really exciting.
Daniel Brennan: And maybe just one final follow up just on China. Obviously, the growth has been tremendous there, but with the tariff noise in the economy grinding lower, that's always a question mark with how sustainable that is. Maybe could you just characterize amongst your four different businesses and all the different secular initiatives China has ongoing likely. Where do you see the biggest runway still for growth dependent upon like where China is with some of their kind of secular -- kind of build out if you will? Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Daniel. It's almost hard to choose because when we think about the investments that are being made in China, in diagnostics, in life sciences, and in and around the environment, along with the dynamics, I just mentioned, a couple of minutes ago, around an evolving middle class and the needs for advanced dentistry, there are important secular drivers in really, I would say, all four of those markets that I just mentioned. And I think we feel that our leadership position in each one of those markets has served us well in the past. We continue to enhance that those leadership positions with innovative products, some of which are designed in China, and many of which are made in China for the Chinese market, combined with continued investments in feet on the street and end market facing associates who are continually looking for new and novel solutions to drive innovation for customers. Those are just great end markets to be in. So I'm not sure, I'd necessarily differentiate a great deal between the diagnostics life sciences, the environmental and the Dental end markets, because I think they all represent important secular drivers that will benefit we have benefited from in the past, and we benefit from in the future.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Laurie. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.

Tom Joyce: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results round out a tremendous 2018 for Danaher. During the year, strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and mid-teens free cash flow growth. We delivered 6% core revenue growth for the full year, which was a meaningful step up versus prior years, led primarily by the impact of new product innovation and commercial initiatives.  The Danaher business system continued to serve as the driving force behind our execution and our ability to take share in many of our businesses. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in 16.5% growth year-on-year that helps position us for significant capital deployment going forward. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a 127%, representing the 27 consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income.  We deployed over $2 billion of capital during the year, including the acquisitions of IDT and Blue Software. IDT joined our life science platform adding best in class genomics consumables capabilities, and Blue Software now part of Esko enhances our offering across our packaging development and production work flow. We are excited to have both these businesses as part of Danaher.  Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 5.5% to $5.4 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenue by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 2%. Core revenue increased 5.5% with all five platforms delivering better than expected results. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single digits, led by double digit growth in both China and India. Across the developed markets, we saw high single digit growth in the US, while Western Europe was up low single digits. Gross margins for the fourth quarter; gross margin was 55.1%, and operating profit margin was 17.9%. Core operating margin declined 15 basis points, driven primarily by accelerated investment spend, foreign currency impact from a stronger US dollar, and tariff related costs. Full year gross margin was a record high 55.8%, and we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth quarter consecutive year that we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.28, bringing full year adjusted diluted net EPS to $4.52, our fifth straight year of double digit growth.  Now let’s take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue increased 10.5% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Operating profit margin declined 30 basis points to 19.7%, as a result of foreign currency impact and accelerated growth investments. For the full year, life sciences delivered an outstanding 180 basis points of core operating margin expansion, a testament to the teams’ strong DBS execution.  Turning to the individual operating companies; Beckman Life Sciences achieved high single digit core revenue growth for the quarter. More than 20% growth in automation was driven by demand for new products like the Biomek i Series, Beckman sample preparation platform launched last year. We further enhanced our automation capabilities with our recent bolt-on acquisition of Labcyte Corporation. Labcyte brings complementary technology to the core Beckman offering, with an acoustic dispensing method that is used for liquid handling in life science applications.  The non-contact low-volume dispensing technique eliminates cross contamination risks and greatly reduces fluid loss, helping scientists around the world to achieve better results. These organic and inorganic growth investments are helping us provide best-in-class solutions for our customers and contributing to Beckman Life Sciences above market growth rate.  Leica Microsystems’ core revenue was up mid-single digits with positive performance across most major end markets and regions, led by life science research in North America. Over the last few years, the Leica team has significantly improved their cadence of innovation through the use of DBS tools. Leica introduced three times the number of new products and technologies in 2018 versus the prior year, while improving their project on time delivery by more than 2000 basis points. The combination of better R&D processes along with enhanced commercial execution have contributed to a meaningful step up in Leica’s core revenue growth over the past few years.  Core revenue at SCIEX was up high single digits. Strong results in North America and China were broad based driven by demand across the clinical, food testing and forensic end markets. Phenomenex, our separations consumables business achieved high single digit core revenue growth. It’s been two years since we acquired Phenomenex and the team has made tremendous progress with a number of DBS commercial initiatives including funnel management and transformative marketing. Through these and other DBS driven growth initiatives Phenomenex has increased the size of their addressable market by 30%.  At Pall, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across both our life sciences and industrial businesses. Biotech was up double-digits, led by strong performance in single use technologies where demand for new products like the iCELLis bioreactor system continues to help drive share gains. IDT delivered mid-teens revenue growth with positive performance across all major regions and product lines. The team continued to build upon early progress with DBS and the business has consistently exceeded our initial performance expectations.  Moving to diagnostics, reported revenue increased 3.5% and core revenue was up 6%. For the full year, diagnostics delivered 6.5% core revenue growth, meaningful step up versus prior years driven by both organic growth investment and the continued evolution of our diagnostics portfolio. Reported operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 18.8% in the fourth quarter, however core operating margin expanded by 20 basis points.  At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by China and improved results in North America. By product line, immunoassay led the way and we saw good growth in automation as well, driven by early success in Europe with our recently launched DxA 5000 automation system. In hematology, we are encouraged by early customer feedback on our new DxH 900 high volume analyzer and the DxH 520 for low to mid volume setting. These are two of the many new products that Beckman introduced this year that expanded our offering and improved our competitive position in the core lab.  At Radiometer, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strong quarter in North America, Western Europe and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines delivered outstanding results, and we believe Radiometer continued to take share in the acute care market. Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits, with broad based strength across most major regions and product lines, led by double digit growth in Advanced Staining. And at Cepheid, double digit core revenue growth was driven by North America and Western Europe. The business achieved a significant milestone in the fourth quarter, placing its 20,000 instrument globally further expanding Cepheid’s market leading installed base.  Continued innovation around our test menu has also been a meaningful contributor to Cepheid’s outstanding results. The team maintained their cadence of innovation with the recent CE-IVD marking of the Xpert HBV Viral Load test, a new rapid test for the quantitation of the Hepatitis B Virus that delivers results in less than an hour. With the addition of this test, Cepheid now offers a complete virology test menu suitable for any laboratory setting, making high quality testing and disease monitoring accessible to even more clinicians and patients.  Turning now to our dental segment, reported revenue was flat and operating profit margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.8%. Core operating margins declined by 185 basis points, primarily as a result of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Dental core revenue was up 2.5%, one of our better quarters in some time. We remain encouraged by science of end market stabilization, particularly in our North American traditional consumables and equipment business where we saw another quarter of positive sell-out data.  Our dental business in China, now over 200 million in annual revenue saw a double digit growth again this quarter. Our approach as a more localized player offering a comprehensive product suite positions us well for continued growth in the region. Our specialty consumables business was up low single digits versus a tough prior year comparison with solid performance across orthodontics and implants. Growth was led by performance in high growth markets with particular strength in China and Eastern Europe.  At the Greater New York Dental Show in November, we featured a number of new technologies from across the dental platform. These included the DEXIS titanium inter-oral sensor and Nobel’s X-Guide for computer guided dental implant surgery. Both important products that support the team’s focus on providing customers with the best-in-class, fully integrated digital workflow.  In addition, Ormco’s full-scale Clear aligner system, Spark continues to be very well received in Australia and as a reminder the team obtained FDA 510-k clearance for Spark earlier in the fourth quarter. This is obviously an important step as we continue our expansion of our Clear aligner offering.  Moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment; reported revenue was up 4.5% and core revenue increased 5%. Reported operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 22.7% with modest core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue increased by mid-single digit rate led by demand for marketing coding equipment and related consumables.  Videojet core revenue was up high single digits, with positive performance across all major regions, end markets and product lines. The team continued to expand Videojet’s powerful installed base, which now includes more than 10,000 remotely connected printers. Using data analytics, we’re able to help customers run their packaging product season plants more efficiently and with fewer instances of disruptive down time.  Videojet’s industry leading connectivity provides unique insights to help us serve customers more effectively and this differentiated offering is a key contributor to Videojet’s above-market growth rate. 2018 marked Videojet’s 9th consecutive year of mid-single digit or better core growth. Our packaging business which included Esko and X-Rite was down low-single digits, but we’re encouraged by recent order trends and feel well positioned by our improved performance in 2019.  Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth to the platform was up mid-single digits. Core revenue increased at Hach at a high single-digit rate of momentum in both municipal and industrial end markets. Geographically, the developed markets in China led the way. For the full year 2018, Hach achieved 10% core revenue growth. The Hach team has consistently combined our expanding commercial execution with innovative new products to deliver this market-leading growth.  Hach’s developed our best-in-class digital marketing platform that we’ve now rolled out across our other Water Quality businesses, and the team has meaningfully expanded Hach’s addressable market with new products like the CM130 chlorine analyzer for dialysis applications and the Claros Water Intelligent Software system. The team’s commitment to continue its improvement has helped Hach differentiate its customer value proposition and further strengthen its competitive advantage.  At Trojan, core revenue declined due to a tough prior comp comparison, but we saw healthy levels of project bidding activity during the quarter and we’re encouraged by the underlying momentum in the market. Lastly, ChemTreat’s high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America and Latin America primarily in the food, chemical and oil and gas end markets. The team’s commitment to commercial excellence has helped ChemTreat sustain a remarkable track record with 2018 marking their 51st consecutive year of core revenue growth.  So to wrap up, 2018 was a tremendous year for Danaher and we’re well positioned as we begin 2019. Over the past several years through a combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, we’ve transformed Danaher in to a higher growth, higher margin and higher recurring revenue company, with strong footholds in attractive, fast growing end markets. Our portfolio today combined with the power of the Danaher business system positions us well as we focus on delivering long term shareholder value in 2019 and beyond.  We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.03 which assumed core growth of approximately 4%. We continue to expect full year 2019 core revenue growth of approximately 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.85. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christy, we’re now ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. 
Tycho Peterson: Maybe want to start on margins, obviously a lot of moving pieces here between FX, tariffs, M&A and then some of the dental investments. I know it’s going to be maybe more of a backend loaded year for margin expansion this year, can you maybe just talk about when some of these acquisitions may turn margin accretive? And then can you also comment on your diagnostic margins, looked like they contracted quite a bit, can you maybe just touch on that as well?
Tom Joyce: Sure Tycho. Obviously we did a few things here in the fourth quarter to take advantage of what we saw was a pretty strong quarter evolving particularly in the latter month of December, and so we did accelerate some investment, some spend in a couple of areas that impacted both the cost of good sales line and SG&A. We accelerated some investment in life science in particular and in R&D and sales and marketing and also did a few things accelerating some cost actions in diagnostics and make some investments in new products around dental. So I think a few things that really made some good sense there and to your point clearly FX and tariffs were headwinds in the quarter and made a difference.  I think if you put those aside, overall margins would have been up roughly about 50 basis points were it not for the FX and tariff impact. So we do see margins continue to improve during the course of the year. Obviously we’ve got a terrific track record here. In terms of acquisition related impact on the margins, IDT turns core here in April, so we’ll start to see those starts to move through. It will take a little bit of a while here before we see the impact of Labcyte obviously our newer acquisition, but IDT obviously will be a much more material contribution. So we’ll see that starting in April which will be a help.  On the DX side, as I mentioned, we did accelerate some cost actions and some investment there. We got a terrific line-up of new products that are coming through and so continuing to invest in our automation product, hematology, some new products that are coming a little bit out in the future around immunoassay and clinical chemistry, I think are certainly also are having an impact there, but we think those investments make tremendous sense.  Obviously we had a bit of a comp there with Cepheid coming off with a fourth quarter in 2017 where Cepheid’s top line was up north of 25% a year ago and was up low double digits in the fourth quarter here. So a little bit less – a little bit of a tough comp there that had some impact on margin, but again specific to DX just coming back very briefly to FX and tariffs, if you put those aside, DX would have been up about 50 basis points in the quarter. 
Matt McGrew: And Tycho maybe just kind of a more color. If you think about the first half headwind that we’ve got in FX, we’re going to see the margin ramp throughout the year. Q1 we’re going to have, of the 400 million of revenue headwind, 200 is going to be in Q1, that’s probably going to be $0.05 or $0.06 of EPS hit in Q1. So if we wouldn’t have had that in Q1 I think we’ve probably would have seen more like double-digit EPS growth at the high end, and the FX impact here in the first half is going to be greater than it will be in the second half heading into ’19.
Tycho Peterson: That’s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on dental, obviously nice recovery there, how much of this you think is kind of broader end market strength versus some of that Danaher-specific factors like the Nobel China strength, and any thing we should be thinking about in terms of Clear Aligner launch in the US in terms of revenue contribution for this year?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well clearly we’ve seen some stabilization in the end market as I commented in my remarks. And that really is coming in the form of improved sell-out in North America, and specifically in the areas that were more challenged in the past several months in quarters which was on a traditional equipment and consumable side. So end market stabilization definitely a contributor, but our execution continues to improve as well, and a number of the steps that we’ve taken over the last several quarters and that has continued to enhance the way we’re executing in that market.  From a Clear Aligner perspective, again things are going extremely well in Australia. But we’re trying to take a very thoughtful approach to the way we expand our geographic footprint, making sure that we are cultivating the right customer target as we did in Australia, the digitally savvy end customer dentist and orthodontist, who has historically taken advantage of our insignia product line as an example. And so as we think about geographic expansion, we’ll be thoughtful about where those markets are well set up from our standpoint for commercial execution and obviously we’re in the process of ramping our own capacity and so that will be an impact as well. I would not expect that we would be talking to material contributions to the dental platform for growth rate this year, but perhaps as we go in to next year we’ll start to be looking at some numbers that are starting to make a difference. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore. 
Ross Muken: So it seems like you had sort of better execution in Beckman this quarter. You know the business has been doing reasonably well relative to your peers. You’re a little underweight in immunoassay. It seems like that had a quite a good quarter. Just give me a little bit of a feel for the execution at Beck and how you feel about sort of that growth step off in to next year, given maybe some of the things you’ve also done in the portfolio there?
Tom Joyce: Ross, the fourth quarter was clearly one of Beckman Diagnostics’ better quarters in some time. And that really comes to or is driven by improved commercial execution in a number of regions and new product innovations starting to drive some impact. And we saw mid-single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was really led by immunoassay and automation and those are obviously key drivers here. 2018 is the first time that our immunoassay business has tipped over and become a bit larger than our clinical chemistry business.  So you see the impact of our commercial execution there and some of the automation related competitive advantages we have that are driving that immunoassay growth rate, and that growth rate has been very consistent in most cases with our competitive set. And so now we’re mixing upward our core revenue growth by virtue of that performance. North America in particular saw some improvement in growth rates and obviously that’s a key battleground for us, and we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing in our competitive win rates and our customer retention rates.  So, I think a meaningful step up here in to the 3%ish kind of growth rate and what we’re looking for is kind of another 40 to 50 basis points of step up going forward, and I think what we’ve seen historically over the last couple of years is that very thing. Automation is going well as I mentioned in my remarks, hematology, you know that’s been kind of a drag for us. We’re seeing a much more competitive product line because of both the high volume and the low and mid volume offerings now.  And I think with what’s coming around low and mid volume immunoassay and clinical chemistry as well as some of what we’re doing in terms of menu gaps that we’ll start to see continued or we will see continued performance improvement there. I think one thing to keep in mind is we – I know we often talk about Beckman its obviously the biggest business in our diagnostic portfolio, but it’s also important to remember the DX platform grew 6.5% in 2018 and so as we do the comparisons appropriately to broad based competitors in the market, we’re feeling pretty good about how the portfolio is stacking up right now. 
Ross Muken: That’s helpful Tom. And may be just – I feel like you guys have consistently highlighted given where the balance sheet is now and how strong the cash flow is, sort of the M&A fire power opportunity. Obviously though it’s sort of been a choppy or a volatile public equity market which sometimes will make transactions more complicated. But I guess how are you thinking about sort of your ability to execute on something at least more sizeable in the current environment and how are you thinking about valuations as you look at them broadly and whether or not you’ve seen sort of sellers given some of this volatility get a bit more sensible around potential prices?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well in terms of our ability to execute and we talked about this a fair amount when we were all together in December. We feel terrific about where we are. Some really good acquisitions this year obviously $2 billion or better executed this past year, IDT and Blue and a few other smaller deals are terrific additions to our portfolio. But the balance sheet today it’s in as good a position as almost we have ever been.  If you think about our leverage ratio today, we’re talking about being about two in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA, that’s the lowest level since pre-Pall and so in terms of our capacity, our ability to execute both from a balance sheet perspective, and of course also from a talent perspective we feel very good about where we are.  In terms of the valuation in the market today, we all know that M&A can be episodic, we are nothing if not patient about looking for and cultivating the most strategic and financially attractive deals.  But the pipeline is good today, our cultivation levels are as good as ever, you’ve heard us talk about the breadth of that cultivation which is across all the platforms probably with a little bit less emphasis as you might imagine right now in terms of large capital deployment, a little bit less emphasis perhaps on doing that in dental, but certainly the other four platforms are off the front line and with the capacity we have, and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital this year, we’re hoping that things break our way.  In terms of sensibility of valuations well of course the sellers have always think their valuations are sensible. This volatility helps clearly, I think the shake up in the latter part of last year may have gotten some folks thinking about what they might do, but things have sort of stabilized here. So it’s early, a little tough to tell, but we’re in great shape and are prepared to do things of consequence. 
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Overall a really strong quarter, I would love to have a little bit color around what you’re seeing out of China, just given the variability of results that we’ve seen across the board from both cyclical and non-cyclical companies have had a range of outcomes that are pretty broad, but what are you guys seeing in China, what are your local guys telling and what kind of confidence do you have in 2019 in the region?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Scott I know there’s a lot of interest in China right now, there’s been a lot written about what appears factually based to be a slow-down in the broad redefined Chinese market. We are not seeing anything specific that we could point to today that is impacting our businesses in China. I think you can start with the fact that we’re really well positioned to cross our core market. Diagnostics, life sciences, water quality, product identification, consumer, packaged goods and of course dental, which as you heard again growing double digits, are great markets to be in. So, I’m not sure that it’s what you’re reading about today which appears to be more of a consumer-driven slow-down in the Chinese market would be as obviously in our businesses.  Our business in China was up double-digit in the fourth quarter. That’s the 8th consecutive quarter or better said the second straight year of double digit growth for us in China. And that was pretty broad based, pretty much across the board; we can’t really point to any particular slow-downs. Over the past three to four years, our China growth has been up high single digits, low single digit. So could we start to see a little bit of an impact there? I think we could. I think these consumer driven impacts can start to move across in to even in the industrial markets psychologies. And while we have a very little industrial exposure left broadly defined at Danaher, whether that’s a Pall Industrial or Hach Industrial or PID Industrial, probably less than 10% of Danaher today and therefore at even a smaller portion of our China business. Those are the things we’ll watch carefully as indicators as to whether or not we’re seeing a broader slowdown. 
Scott Davis: And just a little bit of a nuance question here, but when I see companies take a step up in investments, discretionary investments, always begs a question of are you catching upon spend or you’re getting ahead of spend. And obviously the nuance there being, if you’re catching up, its’ more of a new normal, if you’re getting ahead its more pulled forward. So do you have a comment on that?
Tom Joyce: Sure. It’s an interesting question Scott, because I think it’s probably – I think if you look across how broad our portfolio is in a number of operating companies, I’m sure we could find examples of both. But I think largely we try to get ahead. We try to look for those things where based on what we were anticipating in the quarter, we thought we might now have room for and some things where we can use some good discretion about investments that would have some impact on a relatively near term basis. And so clearly I think there could always be a mix there, but the strategic intent is to look for those things that we knew were right to do, were anticipating that we would do at some point and we wanted to get ahead to try to continue to enhance the growth trajectory of the business.
Operator: Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Derik De Bruin: Couple of questions, first one is any pull forwards budget flushing that – given the tariff issues and just concerned on spending and just net of anything different about spending trends in the quarter?
Tom Joyce: Not that we can see Derik. The order rates looked pretty solid. We said when we spoke in December; we said we had a pretty October and November. That remained consistent in December, and I think in general our businesses are probably a little bit less exposed if you will to budget flush, pull forward, given the 70% recurring revenue which is obviously largely made up of consumables and in some part service. But when 70% of your revenue is driven by that recurring revenue, you’re a bit left whether it’s exposed or vulnerable or however you might want to describe it to a bunch of flush or a pull forward at year end.  So I’m sure there could be a couple of circumstances whether it’s a high-end Leica microscope or a couple of things that Beck has left where somebody might do that. But in terms of materially of it, it doesn’t appear that that had much impact. In terms of tariff, I’m not sure that it had much impact at least as we look at our China numbers throughout the course of the quarter. We’re not a significant target, but right now I wouldn’t say in the cross-hairs, at least if you measured that by virtue of the financial impact. We’ve talked already to about $12 million to $13 million of impact per quarter or about $50 million annually with about $30 million of incremental impact in 2019 versus ’18. So, we’re doing some things obviously to try to offset that. But in terms of the impact of that dynamic on orders or pull-forwards, again limited exposure probably to some extent a limited level of even the awareness level at the China end market level. So, nothing to point to specifically at the moment in terms of the impact and orders of volume. 
Derik De Bruin: And just a follow-up question, have you made any decisions in terms of how much debt you’re going to put on the dental spend, and just a question of sort of like at the time of the spend what’s the RemainCo leverage ratio is going to be?
Tom Joyce: I would say, what we do with Beck with forward there’s probably a good proxy here. Our intention is to launch the dental business with a strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating and ability to use their free cash flow to add incrementally to their portfolio through some inorganic moves, some M&A moves. So, I think our history is probably a good proxy for what we would do going forward. And I think we would do that in a way that also leaves us in perfect shape from a RemainCo perspective. Obviously we start with a great position here in the beginning of 2019. It’s hard to imagine being in a better shape, but I don’t think that dental given it’s a scale will ultimately impact us in terms of RemainCo being set up to win from a capital deployment perspective. 
Matt McGrew: Derik may be the simple way to think about it is. We’re at two times, two turns today. If we did the spin today we’d likely do dental at two-turns. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.
Steve Beuchaw: Actually maybe we’ll just jump off from the conversation there about dental and the spend which is to a couple of more questions around the assumption there. I guess first off any change to the thought process on timing. I think we all remember before that you guys were able to execute a little faster than initially planned. And as you think about the plan for dental for this year, did you anticipate any impact channel inventory fluctuations, and then maybe last around dental is, as you think about the trajectory of margins there, you clearly put a lot of capital to work driving accelerated commercial investments. How do you think about that line in ’19?
Tom Joyce: Talk first about the spend; we’ve said all along we expected it to be in the second half of this year. That is still our expectation right now. I think about it at the [inaudible] and I would probably say it’s – we did four to kind of right at the mid-point. I think dental is more or like probably, I would call it mid-to-late in the second half. You know as we said when we announced, we want to continue to see this market stability. We are encouraged by the fourth quarter performance clearly and deposit sell-out data, but I’d like to see a bit more of that.  And we need to obviously make absolutely certain that the business is ready to stand up on its own and continue to make good progress, and so we’re encouraged by all of that and that’s out just in the last two quarters, we’re really going to have that for much longer than that so we’re making good progress.  One thing that’s clearly on our mind and you guys have all read about it is, the federal government in Washington has reopened, but the shutdown certainly help our timing for IPOs and spends. You probably read in the news the backlog in SEC filings and text ruling and so on so forth are likely going to create some delays. So I think if you put all those things together we’ll continue to make progress. But we need to be aware of some of those factors.  In terms of the channel inventories and your question about that and being influx, we worked really hard over the last couple of years to ensure that we built sustainable processes in partnership with our channel customers, our channel partners to ensure that we have great visibility and transparency around those channel inventories. We talked a lot about that over the last couple of years and have been key to ensuring that we have those channel inventories in good shape for all of our benefit, for both the benefit of our customers as well as ourselves is to make sure that we good transparency and visibility. And I think we’ve established that and a good dialog month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter with our channel partners.  So, I feel good about the stability of those. There is obviously always some variability with sell-out at category-by-category, but as a general rule I think our processes are much better as are the processes in the channel. Finally in terms of margins and commercial execution, again we’ve done a number of things here that we feel good about in terms of driving performance. First of all the cost structure is in much better shape that it was three to four years ago. You’ve heard me talk about consolidating from 10 up close to 3 and probably now north of 30% reduction in manufacturing and back office facility.  So the cost structure is in better shape, but we’re continuing to invest significantly in new product innovation. That will normalize a bit as we go forward, and I think you combine that with the impact in terms of continued topline improvements and that leads us to really continuing to be very positive about our long term growth and margin opportunities and the platform.  So, I think we expect to see some modest growth and core OMX here in the first quarter. But we also expect that to continue to improve throughout the course of the year. 
Steve Beuchaw: Got it, really helpful, and then just one quick follow-up. You’ve flanged a couple of times and it’s very true that the business has transformed significantly over the last couple of years, faster growth, some changes inorganically that have been really helpful. And so I have imagine if you feel maybe better now than you did even a couple of years ago about your ability to drive growth for target investments.  When you think about 2019, maybe we’ll set aside the inorganic, but think about where you can drive organic investments, and what are your top priorities? And then I’ll get back in the queue. 
Tom Joyce: I think we’ve got a number of priorities, but clearly they would be consistent with where we’ve invested really over the last couple of years. We’ve invested significantly in our diagnostic platform organically. I’ve talked about new products that are now having an impact at places like Beckman Diagnostics. We continue the investment rates at Cepheid sustaining those double digit growth rate both in terms of investments and instrumentation, the evolution of the architecture as well as the expansion of the menu.  In life science as well, we continue to make investments; a number of organic investments, but of course inorganic has played a key role there. And obviously with a back on those investment businesses like Pall that have helped to transform the platform, but even as recently as this past year, with the additions of IDT and LabSite, those inorganic moves are not to be overlooked in terms of their impact on improving the growth rates.  But water quality and PID are making investments as well. Those new CIJ printers at Videojet that are helping us to drive connectivity and enhancing our service offering to customers is having an impact on sustaining that growth rate at PID and Videojet specifically, and water quality investing in things like the CM130, opening up a whole new market like dialysis testing where water plays a critical role, those are having an impact.  Now the investment may not be as material there as what might go on say at a new platform at Beckman, but before it has an impact when we roll those things out to the market. So, it’s broad-based but I think within a given platform for an operating company it’s very specific relative to new product innovations that we think can have a material impact on growth rates. 
Operator: Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Welcome to Matt in your new role. Just a first question around environmental and applied, because I don’t think it’s been touched on yet. Wondered if you could give any update on how you’re seeing all that happens that, particularly in some of the more industrial weighted businesses and also flipping over to Pall, what are your expectations for the microelectronics unit there given the CapEx seems to be coming down?
Tom Joyce: Sure. So let’s start with environmental and applied, just broadly, a very good quarter, really driven by a consistent performance in PID and terrific performance across water quality and specifically at Hach. I think those businesses are tracking quite well. They are to your question, each of those businesses, including Pall; represent some of the limited industrial exposure that we have. I mentioned to Scott on earlier question that we’re not necessarily a terrific proxy in terms of the industrial side with about probably less than 10% of the portfolio being at Pall Industrial and Hach Industrial and PID Industrial. And so our sense is, we could see some moderation there in 2019, but in general the underlying trends remain pretty solid.  So, I don’t know that we’re necessarily making any kind of macro call here. But given where we are in the cycle, it wouldn’t be unheard of that we’d see those limited pockets of industrial exposure perhaps soften up a little bit. You know so far so good, Pall Industrial, for example, fourth quarter we’re up high single digits and orders were in a similar range two years stack. Hach Industrial pretty good number, PID numbers, pretty solid. So we’ll continue to watch that carefully.  Specific to your question about Pall and the microelectronics market, that has been a phenomenal market for Pall over the last few years since we’ve been in the business, and so I think it still is pretty solid today as we look at those growth rate, but again I do not think it would be unusual given some of what we’re read about in terms of the let’s just call it the consumer electronics market and similarly what you’ve read about some of the impacts in China to see a little bit of a moderation there.  It’s been tremendous so far, but we’re not ignorant of the headlines. 
Matt McGrew: And that’s also a business Julian. That micro-e business is a business; it’s got a lot less consumables that some of our businesses kind of giving it a little bit more of that cyclicality as well. 
Julian Mitchell: And then my second question is around margins, one with the – kind of a follow-up on the dental question and that should we expect the step up in investment to step back down materially once the spin happens. So you will see in the first 12 months of dental as a standalone company, maybe a decent margin tailwind from that? And then some wide, if we think about the core margins, as you said they were down slightly in Q4, do we expect those to rebound in the first quarter, maybe some of our investment spend firm wise cools off.
Tom Joyce: Well on the dental question, you think that there would be a combination of factors that would impact continued improvement in what you see in dental margins. Some of that would be some moderation in the investment spend around new products, because again as I mentioned, we try to be very focused on continuing to set that business up to grow, not only in terms of the investments we’ve made in our digital platforms because of the importance of digital dentistry going forward, but certainly the investments that we’re making in the Clear Aligner business.  So, some of those may moderate slightly. In the cases of Clear Aligners those actually would probably be sustained. So a bit of a mix there. But again I think in general, in terms of the value creation opportunities of the dental platform, continued improvement in growth and profitability we feel good about those trajectories.  And then in terms of core margins more broadly, I think there’s an impact here as Matt mentioned earlier around FX and tariffs here in the first quarter. As Matt mentioned probably $0.05 to $0.06, and so those will tail walk, we’ll see better margin performance the deeper we get in to the year, but we’d start out in the most challenging part of the calendar for certain. 
Operator: Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: So first a question on growth investments and gross margin, when I think of opportunistic growth investments and the impact on the income statement, I typically look to the R&D and SG&A lines. That said, it looks like there was some impact at the Cogs line this quarter. Is that right and if so can you provide a little bit of detail on what you did and what you expect the returns to be this year? I’m at a high level trying to get a handle on how gross margin was impacted by these investments versus things like FX and tariffs. So that’s another component of the question as well. 
Matt McGrew: Sure Doug. So I think some of the things that we kind of have done is when you think about some kind of cost pull-forwards if you will, specifically around maybe some supply chain related things etcetera like that. I think we saw some of that probably most pronounced in diagnostics, specifically at Beckman Diagnostics. And then also if you think about some of the new product ramps, kind of capacity if you will with Spark at dental and some of our other new product accelerations where you kind of building up for that first time to the degree that we’re able to kind of pull some of that forward here from 2019 and get some of that worked out a little bit earlier to kind of have a more impactful launch and timing some of that with the sales and marketing as well. So you’re kind of holistically planning to pull forward and get a launch out a little quicker. So I think you’ll see a little bit of both that R&D, sales and marketing and those items that impact cost. 
Tom Joyce: I think Doug also, its’ important to think about the situation in the fourth quarter, where again as the quarter progressed we’re seeing the continued good performance on the topline and so we look broadly where there are those opportunities to take advantage of growth investments, and that is one of those fortunate circumstances, it doesn’t happen every quarter obviously, but you look to take advantage of those things because it benefits you both on the short term and in the long term basis and we are clearly not holding back. 
Doug Schenkel: That’s super helpful, and then just a couple of small, unimportant, quick follow-up sun shine. I know that this may not apply to you as much as some other folks, but I’m just curious if you’ve had any success passing along price the offset tariffs in China, and then at a higher level I’m wondering if you’d be willing to share what the growth rate for China is that you’ve embedded in to 2019 guidance? 
Tom Joyce: I would say price broadly defined is achieved across our portfolio largely on the consumables side. It’s a little bit more challenging given the competitive sets in our businesses on the equipment side. So we generally get it on consumables and that’s both true probably broadly and in China. I would not necessarily associate what we’re getting in terms of price which has been very consistent with inability to have us on specific to the tariffs. The tariffs obviously are coming in other commodities than that which impacts our consumables business. So we’re certainly not having a specific conversation with customers about that. But our in general we’re trying to get price on a global basis, and in general we’re on the consumable side.  And then in terms of growth rates, you’ve heard me mention already today about the consistency of our performance in China in terms of what our expectations are for this year. We embedded an assumption that China would continue to be a high single digit kind of growth rate and could very well be right up there at double-digit growth rate, but I think high single is probably the right way to think about it. 
Operator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks Christy, and thanks everyone for joining us. We’re around for questions all day. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-18 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. My name is David, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation’s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference, sir.

Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We have built terrific momentum throughout 2018 and this continues in the third quarter with our team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6.5% core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion, and double-digit earnings per share growth. Our outstanding top-line performance was broad-based, and we’re particularly pleased with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. Through the first nine months of this year, we delivered 6% core growth, a result achieved through a combination of new product innovation, strong commercial execution, and strategic acquisitions which has increased our exposure to attractive end markets. Our team’s performance utilizing the Danaher business system is enabling us to innovate more effectively and to get better products and solutions to our customers sooner, all of which we believe is contributing to sustainable market share gains. So turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 7% to $4.9 billion with the impact of currency translation, decreasing revenue by 1.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6.5% with four of the five platforms delivering mid-single-digit or better core growth. Third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.10, representing 10% growth year-on-year. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in a free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of 123%. Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up double-digits with China and India leading the way. In developed markets, mid-single-digit growth was led by momentum in North America and Western Europe. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 55.4%, while core operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points. During the quarter, both gross and operating margins were negatively impacted by volatile currently movements, particularly in a number of the high growth market countries. Year-to-date, our gross margin is up 60 basis points, and we’ve increased our core operating margin by 100 basis points led by our Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environment & Applied Solutions segments. So now let’s take a more detailed look at our third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 14.5% and core revenue was up 9.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 19.6% with 230 basis points of core margin improvement. This is the platform’s ninth consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement. So, turning to the individual operating companies, Beckman Life Sciences delivered high-single-digit core revenue growth with positive results across most major product lines and geographies. The team’s strong commercial performance and recent new product launches focused on higher growth biologics and genomics markets are helping Beckman increase their customer win rate, and we believe they continue to gain share relative to the market. At SCIEX, high-single-digit core revenue growth was led by North America and China. We saw strength across the pharmaceutical and food testing end markets in both regions, driven in part by demand for SCIEX’s recently launched X500 mass spec platform. Core revenue at Leica Microsystems was up high-single digits. The combination of strong end markets in life science, research, and industrial applications along with momentum from recent product launches drove solid demand across all major product lines. Pall had a great quarter, producing double-digit core revenue growth. The team’s execution combined with good underlying market conditions contributed to positive results in every business unit. In particular, our biotech business, including single-use technologies was up mid-teens in the quarter. In September, many of you braved the rain to attend our investor event at Pall’s Westborough, Massachusetts facility. We provided an update on the business and highlighted what the Pall team has accomplished with DBS since the acquisition. We’ve made tremendous progress accelerating and focusing our innovation efforts, enhancing commercial initiatives, and reducing costs. In the three years since the acquisition, Pall has already achieved more than $250 million of annual cost savings out of our five year $350 million target, helping to increase gross margins close to 500 basis points and operating margins by more than 800 basis points. Pall has taken some of these cost savings and reinvested into R&D and sales initiatives helping double the amount of annual revenue achieved from new products since acquisition and improving market visibility by 50%. The team has done a tremendous job using DBS to drive meaningful and sustainable results across the business and we could not be more pleased with Pall’s achievements so far. Six months ago, we acquired IDT, a leading player in the genomics consumables market and the business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, delivering mid-teens revenue growth in the quarter. At the time of acquisition, we talked about IDT's opportunities to evolve their go-to-market strategy and the team has already made meaningful progress with the help of DBS growth tools like sales funnel management. We’re excited about IDT’s start as part of Danaher and we look forward to their continued progress. In our Diagnostics platform, reported revenue was up 3.5% with core revenue growth of 5.5%. Reported and core operating margin declined 120 basis points to 15.6%, which was primarily driven by transactional losses stemming from the significant weakening of certain high growth market currencies against the US dollar during the quarter. Beckman Coulter’s core revenue growth was up low-single digits with strength in China, partially offset by softness in the developed markets. Looking across our product lines, growth was driven by immunoassay and strength in automation. At the Annual AACC trade show in Chicago this past July, we featured our recently launched hematology products, including the DxH 520 analyzer for low volume settings and the DxH 900 analyzer for high volume applications with the first of its kind Early Sepsis Indicator. We’ve been very encouraged by the market reception of these new hematology products. Beckman also recently launched the DxA 5000, a new clinical lab automation solution that reduces the number of manual steps for a lab tech from 32 to 1. We expect this advancement to help drive meaningful cost savings in the laboratory while simultaneously improving lab quality and turnaround time for faster diagnoses and better patient outcomes. As we enhance our product offering with differentiated solutions for our customers, we believe that Beckman will continue to improve its competitive position and growth profile over time. Radiometer achieved another quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth with solid performance across our blood gas and AQT product lines. Geographically, results were led by China, Japan and North America where recent customer wins contributed to meaningful gains in the US. Core revenue at Leica Biosystems was up high single-digits driven by broad-based strength across the core histology and Advanced Staining businesses. LBS is benefiting from recent new product launches like the PELORIS III Tissue Processing System, which addresses our pathology customers’ key workflow challenges and in turn helps improve their lab processes and efficiency. Cepheid delivered double-digit core revenue growth and continued to be an innovation leader during the quarter. The team added to hepatitis B assay in Europe, which rounds out Cepheid’s virology test menu offering in the region. And in July, Cepheid announced the launch of the GeneXpert Edge, a portable battery-operated point-of-care system specifically developed for near patient testing in developing countries, starting with tuberculosis testing in India and Africa. TB test results on the Edge are available in less than two hours and supported and support a localized single visit test and treat approach to advance the goal of eradicating tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. Turning to our Dental segment, reported revenue was down 2% and core revenue declined by 50 basis points. Reported operating profit margin declined 200 basis points to 12.7% and core margins were down 195 basis points. These margin declines were due to lower sales volume, currency impact from the recent strengthening of the US dollar and investment spend as we help prepare DentalCo for a successful spin-off in the second half of 2019. Core growth in our traditional consumables and equipment business was down in the quarter, driven by expected inventory adjustments in North American distribution channel along with modest declines in Europe and Japan. However, we remain encouraged by signs of end market stabilization as North American sellout data in both the traditional consumables and equipment product lines was positive in the quarter. Our specialty consumables business was up mid single-digits with solid performance across orthodontics and implants led by Nobel Biocare. At Ormco, we recently received FDA 510(NYSE:K) clearance for Spark, our full-scale clear aligner system. Ormco had initially launched Spark in Australia back in June and obtaining this US clearance is an important step to expand our offering going forward. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported and core revenue both grew 8%. Reported operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.7%, including 160 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate. Videojet delivered high single-digit core revenue growth marking their 11th consecutive quarter of mid single-digit or better core growth. Earlier this week at Pack Expo, North America's largest packaging event, Videojet showcased several new printers and technologies including the 1580 Continuous Inkjet Printer. The CIJ 1580 is Videojet's newest mid range offering and we've developed using technology from the 1860 high speed printer. The 1580 provides better connectivity and remote service capabilities for the mid range segment, helping customers reduce their total cost of ownership. By leveraging the existing technology from the 1860 printer, Videojet was able to develop and launch the 1580 in under a year, expanding our Continuous Inkjet offering and providing a broader range of solutions for our customers. In July, Esko closed the acquisition of BLUE Software, a label and artwork management software company. Esko solutions digitize, automate and connect the packaging development and production workflow, from 3D design concepts all the way to printed packaging, point-of-sale displays and e-commerce content. The team is constantly seeking ways to reduce time to market while improving cost and quality across the packaging value chain. The BLUE Software acquisition further enhances Esko's unique offering in this critical process and we're excited to have the BLUE team on board. At our Water Quality platform, core revenue was up double-digits and the strength of performance was broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach had a terrific quarter with double-digit core revenue growth. The Chinese Government's prioritization of water quality has generated significant demand for Hach's offering and helped drive growth of more than 30% in the region. And we saw a solid momentum across both the industrial and municipal end markets in the US and Europe as well where we believe that the team's strong commercial execution is contributing to market share gains. On our second quarter call, in July, we talked about the recently launched Claros Water Intelligent system, Hach's software platform that brings together instruments, data and process management. Claros was recently selected by one of the nation's largest wastewater operations to support their extensive system of treatment plants. Claros will be used to ensure accurate data collection and management from dozens of sources, helping to standardize compliance reporting and provide actionable insight for improved process operations. At ChemTreat, core revenue growth improved sequentially to mid single-digit rate led by increased demand in the metals and mining, food and beverage markets. And lastly Trojan's core revenue was a high single-digits as we continued to see good demand across the municipal end markets in North America. We believe the Trojan team continues to take share relative to the market driven by their differentiated product offering and recent commercial initiatives. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results and the momentum we generated throughout 2018. Our performance is a testament to the team's execution and drive for continuous improvement, helping us achieve 6% core revenue growth, a 100 basis points of core margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth through the first nine months of 2018. We continued to deliver strong top-line results as recent acquisitions, investments in innovation and DBS growth tools have driven better performance and share gains across many of our businesses. Our solid balance sheet positions us well to further enhance our portfolio through inorganic opportunities in 2018 and beyond. The spin-off of our Dental business remains on track and we’re excited about the progress the team is making as we help them prepare to become a standalone publicly traded company in the second half of next year. Looking ahead, we remain focused on building a stronger better Danaher. We believe the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provides us with the foundation to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. We are initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $1.25 to $1.28, which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4%. And we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.49 to $4.52, which would represent our fourth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. David, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.
Tycho Peterson: Tom, maybe I want to start off -- kicking off on your last comment there about double-digit earnings growth. I guess thinking a little bit further out beyond the fourth quarter in light of some of the FX moves and tariffs and maybe a lighter flu season, can you talk about your view of sustainability of double-digit earnings growth as we think ahead to maybe 2019?
Tom Joyce: Sure, Tycho, well we don't get too far ahead of ourselves here. We still have plenty of work to do here to finish up a good -- really good 2018. And clearly, as you point out, I mean there are a whole series of things to be concerned about out in the market around as you say FX and tariffs, potentially even in inflation trends as we go forward. But in general, I mean we feel really good about the macro environment today, and in addition to that, the positioning of each of our businesses around those macro drivers. So, I think as we look across certainly geographically, we see strength across virtually every major geography. If there was any weakness at all, it might be a little bit in the Middle East. But otherwise, if we look across, great performance in China, terrific performance across a number of the other high-growth markets despite the currency fluctuations, and good solid performance in the US and Europe. Things like FX and tariffs clearly represent some headwinds to the EPS number, but we feel good about how we’re positioned to continue to drive growth and share gains in our markets. So, we don’t see anything that could get in our way other than those, those few headwinds that we just mentioned.
Tycho Peterson: And then maybe just one follow-up on margins on Dental in particular, you talked about incremental investments ahead of the spin. Could you maybe just parse out how much of the market impact was FX versus some of those investments? And how should we think about the incremental investments for Dental in the next couple of quarters?
Tom Joyce: Sure, well, we clearly saw some OMX headwind there. FX, both one-time transactional losses and translation associated with the stronger US dollar were contributors to the 195 that we talked about. You know, those high growth market currency fluctuations are likely to continue as we see it today. The FX was nearly 100 basis points of negative impact to core OMX in Dental. The balance of that was in some respect still related to the lower sales volume, especially the higher margin traditional consumables business, but again we felt really good about what we saw in terms of the sellout in North America. Some of the weakness that we saw was in Europe, specifically in Germany, and a little bit of disruption in Japan associated with some of the weather-related issues that we saw there, but in general, we were actually somewhat encouraged by what we saw relative to obviously a large portion of business which is in North America and that sellout. Finally, we are continuing to invest, and that is having some impact on the OMX there. We think it’s important that we setup that business for a better growth profile as it becomes a public company next year. Those investments are clearly in the aligner business, the Spark clear aligner business. We are ramping up associated with our intraoral scanner and our digital dentistry efforts as well as some sales force expansion at Nobel and Ormco. And so, I think the combination of those things we think are make-sense investments that sets that business up well. And in general, we would expect some sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2019. So, we think it’s still an attractive OMX story certainly as growth continues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Maybe, Tom, you called out on the Pall business. It seemed like that was up mid-teens. I know we had some slightly easier comps but that still seems like a fantastic result I guess. I know you showed it off that recently, but in terms of the sustainability of demand on kind of the filtration and bioprocess side, how are you feeling about sort of duration of growth there? And kind of what's driving it in terms of single-use in some of the other items?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Ross. We saw broad-based strength across Pall in the quarter. The biotech business clearly led the way at -- with mid-teens kind of growth. Our life science business, specifically if you breakout biotech and the medical and food and beverage business, solid across the board, but tremendous strength in single-use technologies. Even if you look over to the industrial side of the business, better than 10% growth on the industrial side. Microelectronics, continued strength there, a double-digit growth, which by the way has been sustained for seven of the last eight quarters. Obviously, that will start to moderate a little bit as the comps get tougher. But in general, we are seeing good growth across the industrial side with aerospace being solid as well, admittedly off somewhat of an easier comp. So we clearly have a tougher comp in the fourth quarter. We did 10% or better in the fourth quarter of ‘17. So -- but we’ve got good order trends. We think Pall continues to be a solid mid-single-digit growth business, but the biotech business is going to continue to lead the way. And if you think about the underlying drivers there, we talked about this you know I think extensively, Ross. The large molecule dynamic which underpins a lot of the growth that we’re seeing at Pall throughout our life science businesses as well on continues to be strong. You’ve got 350 drugs moving through there but significantly more than that in the pipeline today. And we think that bodes well for a long-term growth track around large molecule drug production and development and production that will benefit certainly the biotech business at Pall but will benefit us more broadly across our other life science businesses as well.
Ross Muken: And I guess how are you thinking about sort of the M&A environment and the balance sheet I think in the next year. I mean the cash flow continues to be tremendous. You’ve mainly done tuck-ins let’s say in the last 24 months after Cepheid. It feels like the capacity is sort of there but obviously valuation of this market can be tough. How are you thinking about sort of the funnel and kind of large and small transactions and how you think about your capacity?
Tom Joyce: Well, we certainly think we have tremendous capacity today. We’ve basically paid off IDT with our year-to-date free cash flow to this point at a relatively low kind of 2 times leverage number today and that’s going to go lower with our free cash flow generation, which is likely to be in excess of 3 billion this year. We’ve got tremendous firepower. The pipeline is good, it’s been solid. We’ve had tremendous conversations across a number of the platforms and we think there's opportunities in both small and large transactions. Sure, valuations are relatively rich today, but we continue to keep our eyes open for the best and most attractive assets in the market. And with the balance sheet being in the shape it’s in and the multi-industry structure that we have today, which as you know gives us optionality in terms of how we deploy that capital over time, we think we’re in really good shape.
Dan Comas: And Ross I think also on the margin, a little bit more anxiety in the market helps. In addition to rising interest rates, we’re much less interest rate sensitive than lower credit companies and private equity. So rising rates should help us here as -- towards the end of the year and going into next year as it relates to M&A.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: So we’ve got a couple different headwinds we’re dealing with here. I mean currency is always a challenge I guess in this new world we live in but tariffs is about to snap us in the face it seems. And last quarter, you’ve talked about hopefully are trying to -- at least you implied you’d get price after 3Q. How do you -- what's your playbook here, I mean do you go out with price increases now and/or do you need to wait until the actual tariffs kick in and get a real time and what do you think the competitive response is going to be if you guys are out there leading into this?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Well, Scott, we certainly never wait on price. Tariffs or no tariffs, our business is focused on getting price in the markets on a consistent basis. We are seeing that price come through particularly across Life Sciences and our Environmental & Applied Solutions business. If you look specifically at the consumables side of those businesses where we typically have gotten price, those are high value consumables with relatively modest cost impact to the end customer. Those are -- that’s an important leverage point for us, has been in the past and we will continue to be associated with any headwind relative to tariffs. I mean on tariffs specifically just the baseline where we are right now, I mean we don’t see ourselves as being significantly in the crosshairs of the tariffs that have been put out. We said in July, at that time that we thought it was about $10 million a quarter. Now with the incremental tariffs that have been levied, we expect that to be closer to $12 million to $13 million a quarter. And so on a $5 billion EBITDA base are relatively small numbers. But again that doesn’t take away any pressure we put on ourselves to continuously get price in the market. Price is one of the actions obviously that we address. But we are also looking at where might we do some changes in supply chains, where might we shift some manufacturing to various locations? We have some flexibility there, particularly associated with consumables. And we are pursuing the exemption process that we talked about. And while that’s not necessarily an easy road with the US trade representative, there may be some opportunities there. So it’s a multi-pronged effort but price clearly is part of that. I would say what we’ll probably be a little bit more concerned about and reason for a bit of caution relative to the tariff narrative would be more of the second derivative impact on growth. We haven’t seen much of that right now. You have seen tremendous strength in our China business to this point. I mean China was up double-digit in the third quarter and it was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for us. So right now we feel pretty good about where we are in China. But there's certainly room for a little bit of caution relative to any -- as I said second derivative impact on growth coming out of those markets.
Scott Davis: That’s a good answer. And just a quick follow-up. I -- hopefully you can answer this. But am I to assume that Dental is a dual track sell or spin?
Tom Joyce: No. We are -- our intention is to spin the business AKA the Fortive transaction of a couple of years ago where Dental becomes a standalone public company in the second half of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Derik De Bruin: Just a follow-up on the trade question I guess. Are you seeing any signs of pull forwards in your customers amidst some of the strength attributed to just people sort of stepping up their ordering anticipation sort of being the tariff?
Tom Joyce: We have not seen anything that we could point to specifically Derik. That doesn't mean that there could be something deeper in the order book or the revenue side that represent a very modest level of that but we can't point to anything of any significance there. The biggest number that you heard me talk about in China was in the Water Quality platform at Hach where we saw just a tremendous quarter and we have seen a great year for Hach and Water Quality in China. That’s really more driven by policy associated with surface water in China right now and that -- we could see some continuation to that here in the fourth quarter potentially and then moderate a bit from there. But I wouldn’t necessarily describe that in any way as a pull forward at the moment.
Derik De Bruin: Great. And just a question, can you talk a little bit about the biopharma end market? I’m just curious on your SCIEX strengths and maybe if anything is going on there and also Phenomenex, can you sort of talk about it? The demand you’re seeing mostly is it broad-based in biopharma, is it big companies, small companies, US, China, India, just a little bit more color on what's going on in that market and some of the share dynamics going on there?
Tom Joyce: Sure, sure, absolutely. Yes, we’ve seen very broad-based good performance across the life science business. You asked specifically about SCIEX, so I will touch on that for just a minute. SCIEX posted another quarter of high single-digit core growth. North America and China were both good markets for us. As you know well, Derik, SCIEX has a fairly broad end market reach. And so, it's not just in biopharma but we’re in obviously small and large molecule. That was a very good market for us in the quarter and has been. China remains very strong there specifically. But the applied market has been good, solid numbers in the US around food testing but China and India strength as well. In clinical, China continued to lead the way there, but pretty good performance I think across the board. Academic, not a big business for SCIEX but Europe was solid and China was strong as well. So I think across the board that business was terrific. I touched on Pall earlier and Pall being a little bit more closely aligned with large molecule drug production, and as I mentioned based on the drug pipeline that’s going to be pretty consistent going forward. If you look across the other life science businesses, each of them performed well. I touched on a number of them in my comments. But if I look at that -- the performance of that -- those businesses geographically, I mean pretty much across the board those businesses performed really well geographically, like a micro SCIEX, Beck LS, Pall. And then when you turn to the smaller businesses like Phenomenex, Agela, et cetera, each of those were pretty solid in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Steve Beuchaw: Hi, good morning and thanks for the time here. The first thing I'd like to do is just given the comments on currency, follow up there just a little bit. I wonder -- I'm sorry if I missed this but could you give us a view on what currency was to EBIT margins, the total company level in the quarter? And then any view on either at the margin line or on the bottom-line as to what currency might have as an impact on the company's profile over the next 12 months or for '19, whatever makes more sense for you?
Dan Comas: Yes, Steve, the impact in the third quarter was our core margins were up 50 basis points. We think excluding currency they would have been up kind of well over 75 basis points. To call that 30 plus basis points, that's a combination of the translation which is just the strengthening of the dollar particularly in high growth markets where we have a fair amount of revenue and very modest cost base, but that was exacerbated in the quarter by a bunch of transactional items. The swings in whether it was Brazil or Turkey or Argentina where you had 20% swings and all of a sudden we're marking to market, sorry, I got a cold here, but marking to market a receivable and you’re taking a FX hit. So, my guess is we've got a couple of quarters to kind of bleed through all this. More on the translational side, the transactional side is -- what happens intra-quarter, but there will be a little bit of a headwind over the next couple of quarters. I think we can overcome it, but it will be a little bit of a headwind here.
Steve Beuchaw: Bottom-line, I wonder if you could frame up for us in an environment in 2018 where the top-line has been very, very strong, to what extent you might have stepped up any commercial investments that position you for better top-line next year or maybe set you up for potentially some moderation of growth investments such that we could see a slightly different profile in terms of drop through from top-line to EBIT? Thanks so much.
Tom Joyce: Well, Steve, we've continued to take advantage of the strength that we've seen in the top-line and the terrific operating margin expansion that we've had to continue to invest in our businesses for exactly the purpose that underlied your question which is continuing the momentum of building on growth the way we have. Obviously, the comparison between growth rates of 2016 and 2017 versus 2018 suggest that those investments have been well placed to this point and we continue to do that throughout 2018 to set ourselves up well for a continuation in 2019. We've already talked about a couple of headwinds here today. Obviously, as we go into the beginning of next year, those growth investments are going to become that much more important. We've got a pretty challenging comp in the first quarter, maybe even in the first half, certainly a strong flu season this year and the Diagnostic business that's up for a more challenging comp going into the first quarter of next year, but hey, we've got to continue to play offense, drive growth. We've seen tremendous progress relative to new product innovation across our businesses, business-by-business platform-to-platform we have seen every one of our businesses increase their investments in new product innovation and the commercialization associated with those and that's been a contributor and that's -- we've talked, referenced in the past the term the Danaher playbook where we're continuing to stay tight on the G&A side and continuing to take some of that growth fall through that's associated with operating margin expansion and put that back into sales and marketing and R&D and so far so good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Just a handful of diagnostic questions. First, you indicated in your prepared remarks that Beckman faced some headwinds in developed markets. I'm curious if this was just more of the same or whether there were some more pronounced headwinds that occurred during the quarter and that were kind of unique from recent trend and if so if you provide a little more detail? Second, you indicated that FX was having a more pronounced impact on diagnostic margins than some of your other segments in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if FX is impacting demand in emerging markets as well and if so, what steps you're taking to mitigate the demand effect? And then third, based on the 10-Q our quick read of that, it looks like the impact of pricing was negative for diagnostics for the first time in at least seven quarters. Could you provide a bit more detail on what drove the pricing pressure particularly as it relates to lab reimbursement pressures and if this is really a US dynamic versus something you're seeing in other geographies?
Tom Joyce: Look, Doug that is a handful. I actually had to be taking notes during your question. So, I hope I got it right. So let me take a fling at it. If I missed something I know you'll bring me back.
Doug Schenkel: I will help you out. Okay, sounds good.
Tom Joyce: Okay, thanks. I have to admit Doug, on the first one, I don't -- I'll have to go back through my prepared remarks. I do not recall talking about anything in particular that was a headwind to the top-line at Beck Dx. We've had pretty solid performance there both geographically and across product lines. I know I highlighted the strength in immunoassasy as well as automation. I'm going to come back to automation in a minute. We're seeing good customer retention at Beck Dx. We're seeing continued improvement in our customer win rates. And so in general, I feel pretty good about that, but you'll bring me back if I missed something there.
Dan Comas: Doug, our overall developed market demand at Beckman in Q3 was comparable to what it was in the first half? We didn't mean to suggest any shift.
Tom Joyce: Yes. Moving to Dx margins, we did note that the Dx core OMX was down 120 basis points. Significant impact there on the currency side and we'll get into more of that in your questions in a minute both transactional and translational due to the strong US dollar, Dan just talked about the differences between those two and we'll probably see some continuing effect in the fourth quarter and/or the first half driven by the stronger US dollar. But ex the FX impact, core OMX would have been roughly flat year-on-year. So it would've had a pretty significant impact there. In the meantime though, coming back to what I was just commenting on about some investment spend, we continue to ramp up investment spend around particularly hematology because that's an area where we need to enhance our competitiveness and the 900 and the 520 are big parts of that as well as investments in automation and that's really critical because we compete most importantly in those large high volume accounts, we're bolting automation to the floor for long-term customer retention. It is pretty important. So overall, we feel good about how we're investing particularly at Beck Dx. Coming though to your question about demand FX, right now, we couldn't point to anything in particular associated with those FX impacts relative to demand. So far, demand looks pretty steady across our markets. And finally, relative to pricing, in general, we have not seen PAMA have any significant impact from a pricing standpoint. We know and I have always acknowledged that there are pricing pressures in the Dx market consistently. Every time there's a jump off associated with retaining or competing for new accounts, pricing and total cost of ownership is critical, but specific price-related impacts associated with PAMA have been quite, quite modest to this point. One of the impacts that we did see in the quarter associated with what might be considered price within OMX, but really isn't is associated with that automation business where we had a particularly strong quarter in terms of automation, that comes in at a slightly lower margin, but is so important strategically because when you install automation in large volume accounts, it creates a tremendous long-term relationship associated with that capital infrastructure. So in terms of how we balance pricing relative to our competitiveness, we feel pretty good about how the team is doing there.
Doug Schenkel: Alright, that's great. You hit all three perfectly. So thanks for rattling through those, appreciate the help.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Q - Julian Mitchell Hi, good morning. Just the first question maybe on Environmental & Applied Solutions, we haven't touched on that too much yet. Your margins in that business or the core margins had been under some pressure, they came back very, very strongly in the third quarter. Just wondered if you now think that we're past those headwinds on investments for the next sort of year or so and whether there was anything on mix particularly helping the margins in Q3 or there's kind of decent sort of triple-digit core OMX increase maybe sustainable for some time?
Dan Comas: Julian, I think we have gone through a period of very heavy investment both in water and PID. We've seen the benefit of that a number of new products and you see in the growth number. We did get the mix benefit here at Hach. Hach had an exceptionally strong quarter as you know that's one of our most profitable businesses. So I don't think we'll necessarily replicate hitting Q3 going forward, but I think we're back to a point of more normalized call it 50 basis points of kind of annual margin expansion in that segment.
Julian Mitchell: Understood, thank you. And then my second question just around Dental, the issues in the US I guess are fairly well understood and not particularly new, but you talked about some softness in Europe and maybe Germany in particular, maybe just given a little bit of color as to how that played out in recent months. What you think drove that and where you see sort of sell-in versus sell-through dynamics in Europe right now in Dental?
Tom Joyce: Sure, Julian. Yes, the softness in Europe was largely associated with Germany. That market is a bit more skewed toward the equipment side of the house and there were some underlying dynamics associated with cost that Dental organizations were having to deal with. Unrelated to our business in Germany during the course of the last quarter or two. And so, we saw that impact in terms of a pullback on purchasing particularly of capital equipment, and again largely in Germany. So we don't see necessarily a broad-based issue in Europe. In fact, over time, we've actually worked to improve our competitive positioning in Europe and have seen the fruits of some of those labors and investments to this point. So we think we'll get through this German phenomenon here in the third quarter -- in the fourth quarter, but it was fairly isolated.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS.
Daniel Brennan: Hey, Tom and Dan, congrats on the quarter. So I was hoping you can spend a little more time on China. Seven consecutive quarters double-digit growth, impressive. So I guess two questions. First, beyond Hach, were there any big deviations in the growth rates amongst your different businesses in China in this quarter? And then secondarily, from what you are seeing is there anything that would lead you to think that double-digit growth can be sustained going forward?
Tom Joyce: Sure, thanks, Dan. You know, Dan, it was really broad-based. I had looked at it literally operating company-by-operating company and almost without exception we saw a strong growth in China and in many, many of those cases that double-digit growth was driven across a number of different operating companies. So we've talked about the strength that Hach delivered. But if you looked across a number of our other businesses, you'd see that double-digit growth in China and you'd see examples of that in each of the five segments. In terms of the sustainability of it, yes, as you point out, and I had mentioned seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, I think that's likely to be sustained at least in terms of what you might consider to be very high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth. There's the uncertainty that we talked about earlier in Scott's question associated with what the second derivative impact might be associated with growth rates in China if the trade issues and associated narrative starts to impact psychology a bit more. But I think at this point, things look pretty consistent, underlying order rates that we look at across the five segments all look pretty good. So at this point, I think we're okay.
Daniel Brennan: Great. And maybe just one follow-up on a different topic, just on Beckman, I know we just addressed it in one of the prior questions, but when you think about the outlook for Beckman, they go from low-single where it is today toward improving. I know you shared the hematology theme. But maybe can you give us a little bit of a pathway toward where Beckman could get to over the next couple of years and what are the drivers? Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Sure. I think you mentioned one of the key ones and we have talked about this before that across the various product lines where Beckman competes, hematology has been the weakest and the investment that we've made over the last several years and now with these new products coming to market. While it will take a while for those to ultimately impact the core growth, hematology certainly is a lever of ours. In addition, as we continue to perform well in immunoassay, we will continue to you might say mix upward our core growth rate. As you probably know, we're more highly indexed to clinical chemistry at Beckman than some of our diagnostic competitors. And as a result of that with a lower growth rate associated with the clinical chemistry market versus immunoassay, that is a little bit of a drag on our growth rate. As we continue to grow at or above the market in immunoassay, we will mix up our relative growth rate to the market and I think the combination of those two things are two of the biggest factors that will continue to drive us more closer to mid single-digit. One last point though I think it's important to recognize, we're often compared with the larger player or large players in the diagnostic market, you know those names well. The numbers that they tend to put up, it's important to probably compare those numbers broadly to an equivalent portfolio at Danaher which really is the combination of Beckman, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, and importantly, now with our higher exposure to molecular diagnostics at Cepheid, you now look at a portfolio that I think on a full year basis and Dan or Matt will correct me if I'm wrong is out of 6.5% growth rate, on a full year basis, if you look at that combined portfolio in diagnostics. And so, we feel very about how that portfolio has evolved in terms of now positioning us in a very competitive way relative to the overall diagnostic market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. A couple of questions on Dental here I guess, are we past some of the distributor destocking headwinds I guess at this point and how would you characterize underlying demand trends in the US in particular and visibility thereon and how some of those relationships are progressing from a dental distribution standpoint? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Erin. I think we are past the most significant adjustments associated with inventories in the channel. So in other words, that is largely behind us. It doesn't mean that they are gone forever. I know you know well what life is like in large distributors, inventories are critically important. There are always going to be pressures associated with adjusting inventories appropriately, particularly with large distributors like we have in the dental industry, but we're through the big impacts there and we're particularly encouraged by the underlying demand that you asked about and that's specific to North America. We get very good transparency associated with sellout in North America and the recent numbers associated with sellout in North America, both in consumables and in equipment, have us quite encouraged in terms of the stabilization of the overall dental market and obviously a very important market that being the North American market. The relationship with distribution have settled down, much of the inventory adjustments that were associated with the shifting of exclusives between large manufacturers and large distributors, that's behind us. Sales organizations have settled into place in terms of the focus of the product lines where we compete and I think that disruption again is largely, if not, completely behind us.
Erin Wright: Okay. And then one last quick one. I guess how quickly can you ramp up the clear aligner offering and do you anticipate this being a meaningful driver for you near-term in the Dental segment and how would you characterize the roll out and some of those incremental investments that need be made I guess on this front that you alluded to? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Sure, we're going to continue to invest in Spark, both in terms of the evolution of the product line as well as its commercialization. But in terms of the meaningful level of impact, it's going to be a while. Obviously, there's a geographic expansion that we will be very thoughtful about. We started in Australia and that's going exceptionally well. But we want to make sure that we are building sales organizations appropriately, training sales organizations, training our customers so that as we enter incremental geographies, we do that in a very thoughtful and ultimately very successful way. So there's a journey ahead. We think the journey is certainly a worthwhile one because we all know that the clear aligner market is an exceptional market, has great growth rate and there's tremendous opportunities there particularly with what we think is a highly competitive product and very attractive from a value creation perspective associated with our customer set. So step-by-step, I think it will become meaningful over time, but there's a road to go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our allotted time for Q&A. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Gugino for closing comments.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, David. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We are around all day for questions.

Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our second quarter performance, I would first like to provide more details about this morning's announcement that we intend to spin-off our dental business into an independent publicly traded company. We expect this transaction to be tax-free to Danaher shareholders and to close in the second half of 2019. We'll refer to this new entity as DentalCo for the time being and it will be comprised of Danaher's current dental segment, operating companies, which consists of Nobel Biocare, Ormco and Kavo Kerr. These businesses together generated 2017 revenue of nearly $3 billion, had gross margins of approximately 55% and EBITDA margins in the high-teens. DentalCo will be a premier global partner for the dental community with industry leading brands providing world-class innovation, service and solutions for customers. We believe this business is well positioned in attractive markets with compelling secular trends that include improving standards of dental care in emerging markets, digitalization of the dental practice and the increasing importance of dental aesthetics and implant solutions. DentalCo will have a global team of approximately 12,000 associates and will be headquartered in Southern California. The company's strong leadership team will include a number of experienced Danaher executives. Amir Aghdaei, who as group executive has had responsibility for our dental segment for the last 3 years, will become president and CEO of DentalCo. Two other Danaher leaders will also serve alongside Amir on DentalCo's Board of Directors, while retaining their roles at Danaher. Dan Daniel, Danaher's Executive Vice President, currently overseeing the diagnostics and dental segments; and Daniel Raskas, Danaher's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In addition, our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Comas, will serve as a Special Advisor to DentalCo Post-Spin. Over the past couple years we’ve highlighted the progress that Amir and the team have made on a number of key metrics. They’ve done an outstanding job of helping to better position our Dental segment for long-term success and what is recently been a challenging and changing market environment. This is certainly evident in Dental' second quarter results which will run through shortly. Through a combination of recent growth investments and productivity initiatives along with the team's strong commitment to continuous improvement and the Danaher business system, the Dental segment is in a much better position today than it was just a few years ago. Since 2015, Dental's gross margins have increased by more than 100 basis points, while general and administrative costs are down nearly 50 basis points. We consolidated a number of operating companies from 10 to 3 and reduced the business's manufacturing and back office footprint, but 30%. Dental’s R&D spend as a percent of sales is up more than a 100 basis points as we continue to invest in new product development across the portfolio. And at Nobel Biocare, are nearly $1 billion implant business, we’ve increased R&D spend by approximately 20% launched more than 25 new products and increased the sales force by 15%. These actions have put our Dental business in a better position to accelerate its growth trajectory and drive continued margin expansion. So today’s announcement is an important step towards realizing even greater potential for both Danaher and our Dental platform. We believe that our Dental business can be more impactful as a standalone entity with greater focus around organic and inorganic investment opportunities, including M&A, and that this combination to support an attractive earnings growth profile for the business going forward. This opportunity reminds us of the Fortive spin off, we completed a couple of years ago, which is generated a tremendous amount of value not only for the businesses but for shareholders as well. Most importantly and much like Fortive, we expect the Danaher Business System to continue to have meaningful positive impact on DentalCo. Across Danaher, we’re continuously committed to maximizing the long-term value for all our shareholders, customers and associates. And the establishment of our Dental business as an independent company creates a tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on that commitment. We look forward to helping Amir and the entire Dental team for success as they become an independent public traded Company. As per Danaher, over more than a decade, we’ve built our Product Identification, Water Quality, Diagnostics and Life Sciences platforms both organically and inorganically. These platforms share a number of common characteristics that comprise about standing brands of industry leading positions. Each of high percentage of consumables revenue that is considered captive to pursue mostly direct go-to-market strategies and they share attractive growth profiles. Our strategy will continue to focus on building around these platforms to strengthen our portfolio and competitive position as a multi industry science and technology company. Now let’s turn to our second quarter results. We had an outstanding quarter with the team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6% core revenue growth, healthy margin expansion, mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based and we were particularly pleased this quarter with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. This marks our third consecutive quarter of 5.5 or better core revenue growth. And we believe we're taking market share across many of our businesses. These share gains are part of the payback we're seeing from recent growth investments and the team's strong execution utilizing the Danaher business system. We're using DBS growth tools to develop and deliver better products for our customers, and in turn, enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve. You'll hear a few examples today of how we're doing this and taking share across our portfolio. Turning to our second quarter results. Sales increased 10.5% to $5 billion with the impact of currency translation increasing revenue by 2.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6% with 4 of the 5 platforms delivering mid-single digit for better core growth. Second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.15, representing 16% growth year-on-year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in more than 20% growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 120 -- excuse me, 127%. Our outstanding cash flow generation sets us up well for additional capital deployment in 2018. Geographically high-growth markets revenue was up high-single digits with China leading the way. In developed markets, we saw mid-single digit growth in both North America and Western Europe as both regions have gained momentum since the beginning of the year. Our gross margin for the second quarter was 56.6%, an all-time high and up 160 basis points year-on-year, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points. Our terrific margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core growth and good execution particularly across our Life sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 16% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 18.2% with core margin improvement of nearly 300 basis points. This is the 8th consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement, driven by the team's outstanding DBS execution. Segment Life Sciences delivered high-single digit core revenue growth with broad-base strength across prior clients and regions led by developed markets and China. Segment continued to benefit from strong new product introductions like CytoFLEX LX and flow cytometry and the Biomek i-Series in automation. These differentiated offerings coupled with the strong go-to-market focus and execution in biologics and genomics help drive Beckman's above market growth during the quarter. At Leica Microsystems, low double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America, Western Europe and China, and solid demand across all major end markets. Leica had positive results across each major product line with good momentum from new product launches like the ARveo Digital Augmented Reality Microscope which provide leading imaging technology for the most complex surgical procedures in the medical end market. Leica's effective application of DBS growth tools have helped the team develop several important new products and improve their commercial execution, a powerful combination that's been a key competitive differentiator for Leica. Core revenue at SCIEX increased at a high-single-digit rate with strength in North America and China, driven by the pharma and clinical testing markets. The SCIEX team is focused recent innovation initiatives on attractive end market opportunities in mass spectrometry like biologics and food testing, producing unique workflow solutions but enhance our competitive advantage and drive continued market share gains. At Pall, the team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with similar results across both our Life sciences and industrial businesses. Growth was broad-based globally and the team continued to build a strong order book across the business. Biopharma and microelectronics led the way each delivering double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. And we saw a good momentum in our process and industrial business driving mid-single-digit core growth and strong order trends. Our most recent acquisition, IDT, is off to a great start and increased revenue at double-digit rate during the quarter. The team's DBS integration is already facilitating key commercial enhancements and cost efficiencies and we’re excited about this early progress at IDT. In our Diagnostics platform, reported revenue was up 7.5% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin increased to 17.7%, including 150 basis points of core margin expansion. Beckman Coulter grew at a low-single-digit rate led by strength across high growth markets. By product line, our immunoassay and chemistry businesses continued to perform well. And we had several exciting new product launches in our hematology business in the second quarter, including the DxH 520 analyzer for low volume settings and the DxH 900 analyzer for high volume with a first of a kind early sepsis indicator. These new analyzers are faster and easy to use with a much smaller footprint. The early sepsis indicator alerts clinicians to an infection sooner of critical capability given the life threatening nature of sepsis. These new hematology solutions are important additions to enhance Beckman’s competitive position in the diagnostics market. Looking across the rest of our diagnostics businesses, Radiometer, Leica, Leica Biosystems and Cepheid each delivered high-single-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. We saw continued strength in North America, Western Europe and China and growth across most major product lines at each of these three operating companies. Across our Diagnostics platform, recent growth initiatives have focused on improving R&D and sales and marketing processes using DBS growth tools like accelerated product development and sales funnel management to help us develop and deliver better solutions for our customers. At Leica Biosystems, we've gained good early traction in a number of recent launches like the BOND RX Advanced Stainer and the PELORIS III Tissue Processing System. At Cepheid, the team's improved commercial execution and continued menu expansion with new tests like the Group A's Strep Xpress test were key drivers of the business's double digit growth in developed markets. This combination of innovation and commercial improvements using DBS helps us expand and differentiate our offerings and contributed to share gains across these businesses during the quarter. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenue grew 4.5% with core revenue growth of 2%. Our operating profit margin declined to 14.3% and core margins were down 125 basis points due to continued investment spend and productivity initiatives across the platform. Our traditional consumables and equipment business grew for the first time since 2016 and we saw early signs of end market stabilization through the quarter. Growth in China and Western Europe was partially offset by modest declines in North America where inventory adjustments in the distribution channel moderated versus recent quarters. Nobel Biocare led the way in specialty consumables with mid-single digit core growth, driven by good execution in North America and China. Our orthodontics business, Ormco, grew low-single digits. Last month, Ormco launched a full-scale clear aligner system in Australia called Spark, which has received very positive feedback from doctors and patients. Spark aligners combined at Ormco's market leading expertise in creating digital treatment plan with the highly aesthetic orthodontic treatment options. Spark enables Danaher to treat a broad range of patients including those with complex cases. We're pleased with Spark's initial progress in Australia and expect to build upon this early traction to expand our offering going forward. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 11% with 7% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin declined modestly to 23% and core operating margin declined 50 basis points as a result of accelerated growth investment and productivity initiatives across the platform. We believe these growth investments have helped to sustain and expand our share gains across the segment. In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate as we saw continued share gains in our marking and coding business. Videojet's core revenue was up high-single digits and all major regions and product lines generated mid-single digit growth or better during the quarter. At our Water Quality platform, core revenue was up high-single digits with the strength of performance broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach's core revenue increased at a double digit rate of solid momentum in both the municipal and industrial end-markets. Robust results in the high growth markets was driven by continued demand in China as a result of their active project pipeline. Additionally, Hach's recent innovation investments have focused on our offerings in servility, medical and software solutions. Recent product launches in these areas are helping to drive Hach's continued above market growth rate. Last year, we highlighted Hach's rel0065ased of the Claros Water Intelligent system, a software platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers a valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. The Hach team uses DBS growth tool like agile software development and commercial launch excellence to enhance Claros capabilities and functionality and to make important go to market adjustments that improve targeting and messaging to drive better commercial performance. Claros is just one example of how Hach is harnessing the power of DBS to accelerate growth and enhance Hach's leadership position in the market. The chemistry mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across the developed and hybrid markets, by end market growth and commercial facilities and primary metals was partially offset by software results in chemical and food and beverage. Lastly, Trojan’s core growth was up high-single-digits with bookings and revenue growth continuing to benefit from momentum in the North American municipal markets. Good commercial executions and recent new product introductions are enabling the team to sustain a strong customer win rate and we believe Trojan gain further market share. So to wrap up, we’re extremely pleased our second quarter results. Our performance is a testament to the team’s execution and passion for continuous improvement helping us deliver 6% core revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth, 105 basis points of core operating margin improvement and a 22% increase in year-to-date free cash flow. We’re particularly pleased with our continued strong performance on the top-line as DBS growth tools and investments and innovations are helping us to take share in many of our businesses. We’re also very excited about our announcement that will be spinning off our Dental business into a standalone publicly traded company. We think this is an important step to help both Danaher and the Dental business realize greater potential and maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates. As we look ahead, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. We’re initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.05 and $1.08, which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. We are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $4.43 to $4.50 versus our previous range for $4.38 to $4.45. And now expect to achieve mid-single-digit core revenue growth for the full year.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kina, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll now take our first question from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tycho Peterson: A nice quarter. Tom, I want to start with the decision has been Dental now, I guess, given the market pressures, it seems a little bit early, I think the most of our investor discussions people expected this would come in the next couple of years. So I know you've a year to prep. But is this increased confidence in the market picking up? And can you talk a little bit about what needs to happen to get the business ready? And also any comments you want to make on M&A strategy post in and thoughts in a distribution channel 50-50 -- direct distribution rate model long-term for that business?
Tom Joyce: Tycho, good morning, and thank you. I think as you heard us update you over the last, really couple of years or more, we've made terrific progress in the business. And as happens in some challenging businesses and market situations, it does take some time but we are now seeing the benefits of that work. We're seeing those results and early indicators around improved cost structure. The growth investments that we made there are now generating some improved growth in our position in the market, improved competitive position. And I think if you've seen on a relative basis where we can show some outperformance. And so I think in many respects, this is really about the progress that we've made and getting our business to a point where we think it really holds a great potential for that progress to manifest itself and to get them on a shareholder value creation overtime. In addition, I think from a market perspective, the dental market has clearly begun to stabilize. And we think a year from now it will be in an even better place. And so with another year similar to what we did at Fortive, we have an opportunity to get the team ready and to ensure that we have all the appropriate steps completed to be a successful profitable company launch just as we did with Fortive. As a standalone company and clearly off a smaller base, acquisitions in organic investments will have a magnified impact on the business, and of course you've seen that at Fortive as well. Acquisitions in the $100 million to $250 million deal range can really move the needle. And some of the investments that we've made organically around things like the IO scanner, the work that we're doing on clear aligners now, those are all going to be more impactful overtime. So we think this is a great opportunity to create long term value for shareholders. It's got a -- what we think is a very attractive earnings profile coming off of low-single digit core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion with opportunity, plenty of opportunities to go. And in terms of your question about capital and M&A, we're going to set this up as you -- I hope you would expect as an investment grade business with the capabilities to deploy capital through M&A. And certainly in a way that it doesn't hold us back, we continue to be focused on deploying capital at Danaher over the next year and beyond. So this remind us a lot of afford both in terms of timing and in terms of the long term shareholders value creation opportunity whether it's the comparison between the industrial cycle timing in the dental market recovery or the performance of our business getting better and being able to run the Danaher playbook consistently in an independent business. Lastly, your question about distribution, I mean this is the business obviously that has a little bit more of a skew towards going through distribution. Albeit 50-50, Danaher post Dental would be more skewed towards direct more like 75-25, and the distribution channels always going to play an important part I believe in the dental business. But at the same time those direct businesses are superb. And we love those because of the intimacy they have with customers. So I think all in, while the channel structures may evolve slightly overtime, I think both the business and the market are in a much better shape today than they've been in recent times.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then for a follow up, I just want to go back to the quarter for a minute. And if you could just help us bridge the 4% guide with the 6% result, I know you're firing all cylinders, but can maybe just talk if they were sources of supplies are upside relative to your own expectations. Obviously Life Sciences did well against the tougher SCIEX comp, both Environmental & Applied up 7% as well. So can you maybe just talk through some of the underlying momentum in the businesses?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, I tell you we have terrific momentum in the businesses. As I mentioned 4 out of 5 segments clearly at mid-single-digits and above all of the segments in addition to Dental outperforming our expectations. Good performance. That was a combination of both commercial execution and new product innovation pretty much across the board. As it relates to how we look at the quarter ahead, yes, there’s a little bit of moderation in our Q3 growth rate relative to Q2. There’s probably a 100 basis points of tougher comp in Q3 versus Q2. And yes, as you say, we fired on every cylinder in Q2. And we think it’s probably a little bit prudent to be a bit cautious in our outlook given some of the trade related matters. I’m sure we’ll get into this here shortly and then some of the broader macro uncertainties if you will. We still remain optimistic about the future. But I think the combination of little bit tougher core growth and it had bit of caution in the macro outlook was prudent relative to the third quarter and balance year guide.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And just to clarify the $0.01 to $0.02, is that from the tariffs and out of the $0.06 to $0.07 headwind in the back half of the year. Is that the right math?
Matt Gugino: Yes. The right way to think about that Tycho is on currency versus April, the strengthening of the dollar, probably hit our revenue, second half revenue, about $250 million at a 20% fall so that’s about $0.05, and there is about a penny a quarter of transactional impact from the tariffs. Now that’s before any counter measures and we’re working on a bunch of things, but it's probably going to take a little bit of time for us to get some of those counter measures in place.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Davis: I applaud the decision to spin Dental. It seems to work in the past 4 years so good luck with that. I wanted to backup a little bit. I can’t recall seeing the stronger numbers out of Leica and Hach, just those two businesses explicitly you called out as having new products. And how does -- to help us understand that product cycle a little bit better, I don’t remember in the past team that kind of outgrowth. Was there -- are there timing issues where in fact maybe we should see this moderate a bit or is there’s been some or these products so different or special that this is somewhat game changing for likely better orders?
Tom Joyce: Scott these -- both Leica Microsystems and Leica Biosystems as well as Hach, our businesses that have strong track records over a long period of time of creating the market leadership positions that they have created on the back of exceptional products and product differentiation and competitive advantage. We have made some significant progress across not just these businesses but a number of businesses over the last couple of years in improving the approaches that we take to bringing in innovative ideas from the end user and then to execute on those ideas in a more timely and cost effective way. And I think what you're seeing not just in the businesses that you asked about but really across the number of our businesses, the manifestation of a couple of years of work in improving the execution from that front end to bring ideas in all the way to the backend execution and launch and commercialization. Leica, in particular, Microsystems has broadened their new product innovation scope beyond what historically has been a confocal launch cycle. And I think that's making a real different.  At Leica Biosystems, what I mentioned there whether its microtomes, tissue processors, advanced strainers, all of those things are product of a number of process related steps using the tools of DBS to do those simultaneously as appose to somewhat more sequentially. And at Hach, a business that now it's focused much more on ensuring that we deliver higher quality answers to customers through data and data analytics, information and the clearer software system. I think you saw anything to combination of hardware, consumables and data and analytics that is further differentiating that business. So it's a variety of different things but I think the general theme across Danaher has been improving new product execution all the way from the frontend to the backend.
Scott Davis: Okay, fair enough. And then I know you -- it's early days in this pair of trade non-sense. But when I think it’s some of your businesses where you're buying a fair amount of components from Asia or even shipping in from Asia to developed markets. Can you start to prepare the markets for price increases to pass that stuff through? I mean how -- if your competitors have similar dynamics, I imagine they do, but I don't know entirely. How do you start to think about at least whether it's through distributors or otherwise getting playing the ground work at least for the fact that you're probably going to have to raise the prices at some point?
Tom Joyce: Scott, as you can imagine we're sort of in the early days of all of that. We don't feel that we're in the cross-hairs of where they're really going after but, and in fact there is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of middle impacts across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of penny a quarter impact. We're really thinking about countermeasures in four different ways: one would be price; two would be thinking about supply changes; three would be thinking about modification manufacturing locations because we can hit tariffs both ways U.S. to the China and China to the U.S.; and then fourth, there are opportunities sort to seek exemptions around certain areas around the tariffs. They've actually just outlined the process to do that. So I think between those four categories including price, it'll take us a couple of quarters. I think we'll be able to bring that number down. I think the broader question is here does it have a larger impact to the macro environment? And that's more of a -- that's outside the realm of my specialty.
Scott Davis: Mine as well. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys, and congrats on both the fantastic quarter and the spin. Maybe first you called out sort of pharmaceutical strength look like math spec as well had a fantastic quarter. It feels like at least last event using gain share in kind of that market and you had really strong product momentum. Maybe just give us a little color on kind a how you're thinking about pharma overall given some of the noise in that market seems like you're growing right through it and it seems like also on the product cycle or share basis. That's an area for outperformance.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Ross. We feel very good about the life science end markets right now. Generally, coming across the board, they look very healthy to us and we are executing quite well in those life science and market. Specifically around your question on pharma or biopharma, it is normalized, yes, is one way to think about it. A year ago, you saw some softness in that market, you saw issues with a couple of big customers, not just ours, but customers that were broadly served through the market, you saw some inventory adjustments. I think a lot of that is past now. So I think we’re in a market that is sort of returned to normal. But normal in the case of biopharma means a very good growth market and you saw that based on the broad-based strength at Pall. Certainly the exposure we have the biopharma at Beck LS, at SCIEX and Mol Dev, all would indicate that things are very much tracking as you would expect in the biopharma market with double-digit growth in Pall, in the biopharma market led by continued strength and single-use technology. So I mean we’re in a very, very good place in a strong market.  On the broader pharma side small molecule continued strength in China certainly due to generic drug regulations. And I would say generally steady growth in the developed markets. Outside of those specific areas around LS, if you think about the applied market, pretty solid there certainly food testing continues to be a good market. The academic market is pretty solid, China up nicely. We don’t have, as you know, we talked about this in the past. A lot of direct funding that comes from NIH. But NIH funding obviously trickles down to the market and the increase in NIH funding should bode well. And then in the areas where we have a bit more of, you might say industrially oriented exposure in life science. For example, if you looked at our mid single-digit core growth at Pall Industrial, good performance there. Market, I think, is pretty steady. But our performance continues to improve. So I think on balance, we feel very good about the life science end markets and specifically the ones you asked about. Geographically, I think, China continues to be the strongest area with double-digit growth there. We’ve added terrific performance in China across the number of our businesses but life science across clinical academic and pharma is strong, in the developed markets pretty stable. And interestingly, just a side note, demand -- we had probably one of the best quarters in Japan we’ve had in certainly, in any kind of recent memory. So on the life science side double-digit core growth so the performance there.
Ross Muken: And then maybe second, you’ve done a number of upcoming interesting transactions last few years that were highly growth accretive and it seems like you’re doing quite well. So maybe just an update on IDT, which seems to be after a very strong start in Phenomenex, it seems like Cepheid also had another good quarter. And how you feel like sort of post spin, it feels like the RemainCo, the traditional Danaher that this year would have been growing north of 5. How do we think about the new growth profile of kind of the business now, the Dental, which it had obviously a number of years of some challenges is going to be its own entity to kind of create value on its own? How do you think about what Danaher looks like from here on now the top-line wise at least?
Tom Joyce: Sure. As I mentioned very briefly in my prepared remarks and believe me I couldn't given them very more verbal high-5s. The performance at IDT has been terrific thus far. We're thrilled with what the team is doing there. It was a double digit recorded and very much what we expected. And I think that continued very good trajectory for that business. And we have lots of opportunity to improve the commercial execution of that business and continue to work on how we expand that business particularly geographically. So we're off to a very good start. Phenomenex continuing to perform very well. And then Cepheid as you'd mentioned absolutely had a good quarter. But also again it's actually a challenging comp at Cepheid and still had a good quarter. And we expect to see Cepheid's growth rates pick up in the third quarter off the second quarter numbers. So I think each of the new acquisitions, which as you appropriately mentioned, have all been accretive to sort of the fleet average core growth of the business prior to your acquisition, all those are tracking quite well. As we think about Danaher going forward, I think there are a number of factors that I think will contribute to improving our growth profile and are contributing today. Clearly, acquisitions, we just talked about those, but it is about our day in and day out execution as well in businesses that we've owned for some time. And we see continued good performances for businesses that we've owned for 3 or 4 years and businesses that we've owned for 10 and 12 years and more. And so that day in and day execution and, particularly around new product innovation that I just mentioned to Scott, is a contributor. We think we positioned the portfolio in exceptional markets, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Water Quality, proliferation of packaging and packaging configurations around the world, all of those are terrific positions to be in and with the strong position in the high growth markets. And each of those secular drivers I just mentioned contributing in a magnified way in the high growth markets we think we have a great position there. And then finally, the balance sheet remains in terrific shape. We will virtually paid off a good deal if not all of IDT already this year. And so the balance sheet is ready willing enable to get after continued deployment. And obviously our bias would be to continue to look for opportunities where near term and, certainly long term growth prospects are at or accretive to the portfolio. So I think it's a combination of things as we think about the portfolio ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you and good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: In your prepared remarks you noted that Europe and North America have gained momentum since the beginning of the year. Are there any key end markets or product areas that are worth noting in a little more detail? And how would you characterize the outlook for this building momentum to be sustained moving forward, especially given some of the mix macro data coming out of Europe?
Tom Joyce: Doug, looking at geographically in the developed markets, I mean, it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio. Just thinking about a couple of businesses that just to name a few that grew double digits in North America in the quarter, in Life Sciences like Microsystems grew double-digits. The other businesses in North America were mid-single-digit growth or slightly better in the case of Europe life science businesses across the board, we’re pretty well solidly in the mid-single-digits. If we look in Diagnostics, clearly Leica Biosystems performed well in both of those markets, Cepheid in both of those markets. So it’s hard to pick out businesses where there was some particular weakness in the developed markets. And that’s not to say that they’re all at the same rate. But generally, as I look across each of the businesses there was quite broad-based.
Matt Gugino: Maybe I would add, clock tend to be a reasonably good bellwether because they get both to the industrial and to sort of the government, the municipal side of it. And they were up, I think, high-single-digits both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. Some of that's clearly share. We don’t think the markets growing that well. But it does suggest reasonable stability in those regions right now.
Doug Schenkel: Okay.
Tom Joyce: If I look at another say broad-based player just in a very macro, in context, Doug, if I look at Videojet, mid-single-digit growth solidly, so in North American and actually double-digit growth in Europe, and that’s in the quarter, I mean that’s not necessarily the long-term there, but the point in time good performance.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, that’s helpful. And just for my follow-up and quickly flipping through the 10-Q this morning, it appears pricing was more of a tailwind this quarter than we seen recently in both Life Sciences and EAS, anything to talk about there really. What were the key drivers? Was there anything related to tariffs say price increases that were dropped into the quarter although I would think that would be pretty early? And then how are you factoring this into guidance for the balance of the year?
Tom Joyce: Doug, that's unrelated to tariffs. I mean, we clearly are seeing the benefit on the industrial side and you’ve seen that tick up both across our water and PID business. In the healthcare businesses, it has been more challenging. It was a little bit better sequentially. Those businesses, I think will remain challenging to get a lot of price and we’ll continue to be leaning more on the industrial business for price. So I think it’ll take a little bit of time but hopefully we’ll get a little bit more price as potential offset to the tariffs. But that’s not going to kick in here in Q3.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Beuchaw: In the backdrop of the really strong operational performance and interesting transformational opportunity for Dental, I wonder if we could get an update on a question that has been in a more to forefront over the last several months, which is capital deployment for RemainCo. I wonder to what extent it any does the management bandwidth commitment associated with getting Amir and the team ready to Spin. Does that in anyway impact your thinking about capital deployment? And if you could give us any broad-stroke views on how your views on how capital deployment should be executed this year that would be really helpful.
Matt Gugino: Sure, Steve. We remain absolutely committed to continuing to deploy our free cash flow and beyond in the interest of the 4 platforms that we will have in RemainCo over the next year. Life Sciences, Diagnostics, PID and Water all stand at the front of the line for capital deployment. And so that has been and will continue to be our bias. As was the case for every during the period, the similar periods, the year that we work to stand at Fortive, we continue to have that bias and focused on deploying capital. So nothing really changes about either our commitment to or our ability to deploy capital in the interest of those 4 platforms going forward. So we feel good about where the balance sheet sits today and we see some interesting opportunities in the pipelines that we continue to review.
Steve Beuchaw: Okay, great. Good to hear. And then just two very similar points I wanted to follow up on the businesses. First is a SCIEX, you called out clinical as a growth driver. Once upon a time there were some reimbursement changes that were tougher to clinical business. Can I take your comments to mean that is that part of the business in applied clinical to that not really working now subsequent to those changes maybe. Does that include any benefit from the Topaz launch? And then on Dental, I wonder if you could give us just an update on what you're thinking about organic growth or core growth for the back half of this year and given some of the comments that you made about the improving trends, stabilizing trends that you see in this space? Thanks so much.
Tom Joyce: Sure, Steve. So on SCIEX, you're right, we did comment specifically about clinical. And the reference that you made just for others on the call, I know, you're knowledgeable to Steve. Around reimbursement really had to do with what the industry knows and we referred to pain panels or pain management, and changes in reimbursement that go back couple of years now had an impact on portion of the SCIEX business associated with testing for pain management. And as that reimbursement change we sought some slowdown, some declines actually in that clinical business. We have rounded the corn on that if you will. We lap over those comps now. So to some extent we have an easier comp as that reimbursement dynamic is now behind us. And we'll see some incremental growth in our clinical business overtime. And yes, we're very pleased with how Topaz has come out of the blocks. So somewhat early days post that launch, but that and other new product introductions at SCIEX are continuing to contribute to good growth. And relative to Dental going forward and in the back half, I think our view continues to be that that will be a low-single-digit growth rate in the back half. Again, we saw some early indications that we'll see some incremental growth and we saw that in the second quarter. But it still going to be a low-single digit growth as that market continues to stabilize. But our continued improvement in our performance associated particularly with new product innovation and good commercial work. We think even in the face of what may still be a challenging end market should certainly have us on an improving track.
Steve Beuchaw: Really appreciate all that. Thank you. 
Tom Joyce: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Derik De Bruin : Dan, good morning.
Dan Comas: Good morning.
Derik De Bruin : Couple of questions. So just noticed that Cepheid grew high-single digits this quarter, which certainly is lower than it has in the most recent quarters. Just -- can you guys talk about anything unusual there comps just moving from that? And I’ve got a follow-up.
Dan Comas: Sure, absolutely. And sorry, I just made a big -- just a path in reference to that, just a couple of minutes ago. Yes, Cepheid grew high-single-digits, actually, a number of very positive factors in terms of new customer acquisition and penetration of new products behind that high-single-digit number. But you’re right lower than the trend line we had. That’s really just a function of challenging comp in the high growth markets or what was formerly referred to as the HBDC or hybrid and developing countries arena. We had some pretty big numbers a year ago on that in one market in particular. And so we fully expected that Cepheid will return and we will see an uptick in that growth in the third quarter back to the 10% range or better that we’ve seen in the past.
Tom Joyce: Derik, if you look at the business ex-HBDC and that’s out of 20%, we’re up mid-teens in the core business.
Derik De Bruin: Okay. That’s actually the number that's why I was looking for. Great. That makes sense, because you know and if I remember correctly, big NDA order last year or China order?
Tom Joyce: Yes.
Derik De Bruin: Okay. That puts it into the perspective. And as we’re sort of at mid-year, have you seen any pushback from hospital labs on due to PAMA, just sort of thinking about what capital spending at the hospital labs and just thinking about. Are they working their budgets that they're pushing back to some sort of update now that we have some time to digest?
Tom Joyce: Sure. They are clearly watching their budgets. And there are certain situations where we’ve seen some pricing pressure. But I think as I mentioned, right, when PAMA became a reality, Derik, in many respects, this is sort of standard operating procedure in the diagnostics market at least in the large central lab. There is always been a basis for some level of pricing pressure, particularly when you are seeking either new business or renewing your existing business. And so there’s certainly some of those dynamics aren't put, but in the overall scope of our Diagnostics platform and relative to margins, the impact is very, very modest to marginal.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steven Winoker: Dan, I just, first want to follow up on the tariffs comments you made. That tariffs that you’ve contemplated, is that the only the $50 billion so far or includes the other $200 billion on top of that?
Dan Comas: That’s the higher number.
Steven Winoker: The higher number, okay. And presumably, should that go to the full about beyond the $200 billion. Have you take, right, not the demand factor. We can’t -- and so we do not, I mean, I don’t know if we can double it, we don’t -- have you quantify that yet?
Dan Comas: We’re taking it like you guys as it comes hourly.
Steven Winoker: Okay.
Tom Joyce: Sitting here at six blocks in the White House doesn’t mean we get the info any quicker than you guys do.
Steven Winoker: Yes, I figure one of you withstanding outside sitting with there. Anyway, okay. So now on the Dental split, Tom, I understand the rationale for that. But one of the comments you had made and we’ve seen it play out as the larger impact on M&A on a smaller entity when you do this and given the importance of M&A to the whole model and how that plays out. But why can't I extent that logic even further to the rest of what system side of RemainCo? In other words, if it's true for Dental, why wouldn't that be true for ENAS?
Tom Joyce: Well, I think, first of all we love those businesses in terms of their consistencies that those businesses have with the model across the portfolio. They have very similar growth profiles across the 4 platforms. You have very similar margin profiles. You have, in the most cases, much more captive levels of consumables associated with those businesses. And you have a science and technology orientation to those businesses that I think unifies them into a common business model. And so while you certainly can make a case that depending on the size of business, M&A can make more magnified difference in one versus the other. The commonality of the business model I think is what unifies the four platforms going forward.
Steven Winoker: Okay, that's very clear. And then just if I could on the business units on Pall, I mean, can you talk a little bit more about the puts and takes on the growth rate there around the different components? And particularly focused on some of the things that maybe kind of holding it back a little bit?
Tom Joyce: Well, I think we've seen as I mentioned good performance across Life Sciences with Biopharma very strong, single used technology is very strong. If it was an area in what we broadly describe is Life Sciences that wouldn't be really growing at quite the rates that we see in Biopharma and SET. It probably would be the smaller portions of the Life Sciences segment which are life science businesses at Pall which will be the lab food and beverage business and the medical businesses. And again those are smaller but obviously are not posting the same growth rates. And then as I mentioned on the industrial side, really good performance in Micro that's been consistent for a long time. And then the fluids oriented process business, we're starting to see some better performance there and that's largely more a function of our execution. If there was a softer part of the industrial side of Pall, probably would be on the aerospace side. But we have a very strong competitive position there nevertheless.
Dan Comas: And Steve, as we've alluded to, bookings have been very strong. And part of that play down Q2. Q2 was 200 basis points better than Q1. And we expect another kind of comparable sort of step up here in Q3. So we feel a lot of momentum there and our shipments actually sort of understate what we're really seeing in the business today. As you know that can be a little bit more of the lag business.
Steven Winoker: Right, that's helpful. And then finally that core operating margin contraction in the 2 businesses Dental and EAS, in terms of you explained that that was investments and productivity spending, but how much longer should we anticipate that continuing?
Tom Joyce: Well, I mean, it's a little bit dependent on what we're seeing in the quarter because we saw a lot of strength by mid-quarter and businesses like Dental and EAS that had both productivity opportunities and growth opportunities, we sort to say go after to where things are trending well, so little bit of that dynamic. But I think on the EAS, we'll begin to sort to see that get better. Dental, we're going to be doing some things to really, to make like we did in Florida to make sure we're set up welcome next July.
Operator: Our final question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Just one question on Dental. I would be curious to hear if the channel dynamics were still a negative drag on the top-line in 2Q? And if you could elaborate kind of on traditional consumables sellout trends in both the U.S. and Europe?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Brandon as I mentioned, I think we’re in a much more stable environment right now, relative to the channel dynamics that you asked about. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that what we talked about in the past about channel related inventory adjustments had moderated significantly during the course of the first half of this year. So I think the vast majority of that is behind us. I always had to take to say that we’ve never seen the inventory adjustments. Again, because I think that the distribution channels always going to be somewhat sensitive the distribution based on what sellout looks like. And so I think, in general, we’re in a much better place and the vast majority of that is behind us. The realignment of the sort of the preferential exclusives or the unwinding of those exclusives is better said, I think now is largely behind us. There’s still obviously some ramp of new sales forces in with different distribution partners could have an impact on growth rates. But in general, I think, that’s starting to normalize as well. So I think when you take those things together and then you look at what was our core growth rate and some improving sellout, I think we’re just in a much better place today
Operator: That will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Gugino. Please go ahead.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Kina, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We’re around all day for questions.
Operator: That will conclude today’s call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

Tom Joyce: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We’re off to a great start in 2018 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectations. We delivered our second consecutive quarter of 5.5% core revenue growth mid-teens earnings per share growth, healthy margin expansion and strong free cash flow. This performance is a testament to the power of the Danaher Business System, consistent execution by the team and our focus on long-term value creation. We drove share gains at a number of our operating companies while continuing to invest in our businesses to enhance our long-term growth trajectory. Our performance in the quarter, combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our solid balance sheet, positions us well for strong performance in 2018 and beyond. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 11.5% to $4.7 billion with the impact of currency translation increasing revenue by 5% and acquisitions adding 1%. Core revenue was up 5.5% with 4 of our 5 platforms delivering mid-single-digit or better core growth. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.99, representing 16.5% growth year-on-year. We generated $691 million of free cash flow, resulting in over 70% growth year-on-year, and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 122%. Our outstanding cash flow generation sets us up well for additional capital deployment in 2018. Geographically, high-growth markets revenue grew approximately 10% with China and India leading the way. In developed markets, we saw a mid-single-digit revenue growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in North America. Our gross margin for the first quarter was 56.3%, an all-time high and up 80 basis points year-on-year while core operating margin expanded 140 basis points. Our margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core growth and good execution, particularly across our Life Sciences & Diagnostics platforms. Now let’s take a more detailed look at our first quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 13% and core revenue grew 5.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 18.4% with both core and reported margins increasing over 200 basis points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement as the team continues their outstanding DBS execution. Beckman Life Sciences delivered double-digit core revenue growth with positive performance across all major product lines and regions. You’ve heard us talk about Beckman’s improved innovation cadence over the last few years, which has helped drive consistent mid-single-digit or better core growth. The combination of the team’s new product development and commercial execution has also enhanced margin performance. Today, both gross and operating profit margins are more than 500 basis points higher than 3 years ago. We believe that innovation defines our future. And Beckman is a tremendous example of this Danaher core value. At Leica Microsystems, low single-digit core revenue growth was led by Western Europe and China. From a product line perspective, we saw good momentum in confocal, driven by demand for the recently launched SP8 DIVE microscope. The SP8 DIVE enables more advanced imaging of complex biological processes in live tissue samples, which is key for driving breakthrough discoveries in cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Core revenue at SCIEX increased at a high single-digit rate with particular strength in Western Europe and China. SCIEX maintained strong instrument win rates inclusive of the x500R series, which is primarily used for food, environmental and forensic applications. Our separation consumables businesses, Phenomenex and Agela, also performed well, achieving nearly double-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. Turning to Pall. The team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by strength in both our Life Sciences and industrial businesses. In particular, biopharma had another good quarter, led by double-digit growth in the single-use product category. We’re seeing steady order trends across our biopharma business and we expect performance to accelerate as we move through the year. Pall’s process and industrial business achieved its second consecutive quarter of growth, driven by a strong order book. Microelectronics performed well yet again as the team’s terrific commercial execution and recent product launches contributed to ongoing share gains and another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of Integrated DNA Technologies, or IDT, for a purchase price of approximately $2 billion. IDT manufactures high-quality custom DNA and RNA oligos used in a variety of genomics applications, including biopharmaceutical research and development and clinical diagnostics. IDT’s products and solutions help scientists better streamline their workflows and advance their research as they work to cure some of the world’s most challenging diseases. As a leading player in the fast-growing genomics reagent segment, IDT has generated double-digit core revenue growth and has an attractive margin profile. The business will be a stand-alone operating company in our Life Science segment. And we’re excited for the IDT team to join Danaher. Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 14.5% and core revenue increased 9.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.3% with both core and reported margins up 470 basis points. This improvement is largely attributable to higher sales volumes and cost savings derived from productivity initiatives implemented last year. At Beckman Coulter, low single-digit core revenue growth was led by the high-growth markets, particularly China. Across our product lines, we saw growth in immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry. The Beckman team strengthened their product offering with the recent addition of the Access Sensitive Estradiol assay, which rounds out our comprehensive reproductive health test menu. This new estradiol assay provides a unique combination of high sensitivity and broad measuring range, which reduces the need for costly repeat testing. This launch follows the recent FDA clearance of Beckman’s Automated AMH assay in the U.S. And these new additions establish our reproductive health portfolio as one of the most comprehensive menus in the industry. Radiometer grew at a mid-single-digit rate with strength in China, driving double-digit gains in high-growth markets. Both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. The momentum was broad-based both in terms of geography and across all major product lines. Recently launched new instruments in advanced staining and core histology have gained traction and have been key contributors to Leica’s performance. In the spirit of continuous improvement, the Leica Biosystems team has focused recent DBS initiatives on new product development and launch excellence. We’ve reduced our time to market for new products by almost 50% and introduced 3 times as many new products in the last 12 months as we did in the prior year. The effective use of DBS growth tools enables Leica Biosystems to accelerate the development of differentiated workflow solutions, helping improve quality and turnaround time for our anatomical pathology customers. At Cepheid, the team delivered another tremendous quarter with more than 40% core revenue growth as all major regions and product lines performed very well. Cepheid’s fantastic results during the first quarter were driven by a combination of good commercial execution, test menu expansion and what has been a particularly challenging flu season. One example of Cepheid’s test menu expansion is the recent FDA clearance of the CLIA-waived Xpert Xpress Flu test. With this CLIA waiver, Cepheid can provide easy-to-use molecular testing in different care settings that are more easily accessible to patients, like a physician office lab or a local clinic. By bringing critical testing closer to the patient, Cepheid provides a more convenient and comfortable patient experience without compromising testing accuracy. We could not be happier with the progress that the Cepheid team is making. And they continue to exceed our initial expectations 18 months post acquisition. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down 3%. Dental’s operating profit margin declined to 7.6% largely due to lower sales volume, continued investment spend and productivity initiatives across the platform. By product line, positive performance in our specialty consumables businesses, including mid-single-digit core revenue growth at Nobel, was more than offset by anticipated declines in equipment and traditional consumables. As we’ve mentioned over the past few quarters, we continue to see a negative impact from the realignment of certain distributor and manufacturer relationships, resulting in inventory adjustments in the distribution channel. Additionally, given the strength across our other businesses, we took proactive measures in the first quarter to address some of these challenges. We believe the negative impact of these dynamics will moderate as we move through 2018. In the meantime, we’re investing in new product development across our Dental portfolio. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental trade show in February, we featured several innovative products around our digital offering, including the KaVo X Pro intraoral scanner, which provides market-leading speed and accuracy with a comfortable, easy-to-use design. By expanding our digital product line, we’re able to provide our Dental customers with the integrated solutions they need across their entire workflow, from patient diagnosis to treatment. Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 4.5%. Core operating margin increased by 15 basis points and reported operating margin declined 60 basis points to 22.1%. In Product Identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. We saw a high single-digit core growth in our marking and coding businesses with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Low single-digit core growth in our packaging and color solutions was driven largely by North America and Western Europe. 2017 was an exceptional year for Videojet in terms of new product development, and we’re certainly seeing the positive results from those product launches beginning to materialize. New technologies, like the continuous inkjet 1860 printer, which offers broad onboard predictive analytics and remote service connectivity, have gained great early traction and are contributing to Videojet’s consistent growth. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue was up mid-single digits with the strength of performance broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach grew at a mid-single-digit rate with our core municipal and industrial end markets continuing to perform well, particularly in North America, Latin America and China. Hach achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in China during the quarter with the team’s enhanced commercial execution helping to position the business well for the Chinese EPA’s active project pipeline. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, we’ve increased our win rate for municipal projects focused on protecting and monitoring water resources across the country. At ChemTreat, low single-digit core revenue growth was driven by solid performance in Latin America and certain other high-growth markets. By end market, growth in mining and power was partially offset by softer results in chemical and oil and gas. Lastly, Trojan’s core growth was up high single digits as the team sustained a strong customer win rate and market share gains. Bookings and revenue growth benefited from momentum in the North American and Chinese municipal markets. Trojan’s performance is supported by a combination of outstanding execution and recent new product introductions, which expand Trojan’s capabilities and further enhance their competitive advantage. So to wrap up, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter results and continue to generate momentum as we strive to build a better and stronger Danaher. Our performance was a testament to the team’s execution and unending drive towards continuous improvement, helping us deliver 5.5% core revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth, 140 basis points of core margin improvement and an over 70% increase in free cash flow. We’re also pleased to welcome IDT into our Life Science platform, giving us greater exposure to the highly attractive, fast-growing genomics consumables segment. Even with this acquisition, our balance sheet remains strong and positions us well for additional capital deployment as we move through 2018. So as we look ahead, we believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher Business System provide us with the foundation to achieve long-term shareholder value creation. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.07 and $1.10 which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4%. We are raising our full year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $4.38 to $4.45 versus our previous range of $4.25 to $4.35. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Debbie, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question today from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey Good morning, good quarter. Just to kick it off, I hate to start with Dental, but that was certainly softer than we’ve been expecting against the flat comps. So can you, Tom, maybe just talk a little bit about where are we in the distributor destocking cycle? And then should we still be expecting a recovery to kind of low single-digit growth in the back half of the year?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Tycho, I think as you know and certainly others know, our North American Dental business largely goes through distribution partners. And we have outstanding relationships with these partners, where they provide a whole array of services and training and support associated with their value proposition. And we partner with these distributors to deal with challenges as time goes on. And when you have a combination of a modest end market environment as we’ve had and recent shifts in these exclusive distribution and manufacturer relationships, these tend to create these inventory challenges. Now these are two different unique factors. But we team with the distribution channel and work with them to adjust inventory levels where and when we can. And in turn, they work with us to drive growth programs to stimulate end user demand. And so really what you saw here in the quarter was a proactive effort on our part to work with the channel to make these adjustments, and in turn, also work with them in supporting them on these growth programs. So all that being said, you end up with a – obviously a print that is a tough print, particularly here in North America. But that being said, we think there are a lot of things that are frankly pointing in the right direction relative to improvement in the Dental performance going forward. Our high-growth market, this business remains very solid with China continuing to grow double digits in the first quarter. The specialty consumables business remains good, Nobel up mid-single digits. It was one of our better quarters in Europe in some time, where there’s less channel noise. Kerr was up mid-single digits there. And sellout has begun to stabilize, in fact, has stabilized for KaVo Kerr, including the second straight positive quarter for Kerr in North America on the sellout side. So I think there’s a number of things that we would point to that would suggest tough print here in certainly associated with that KaVo Kerr business in North America in the quarter. But a lot of reasons to believe that we’ve sort of flattened out on a bottom here and we’re going to see some improvement in performance going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a context both in terms of what happened in the quarter, but also why we’re positive on things beginning to improve.
Tycho Peterson: That’s helpful. And then a follow-up on Diagnostics, two questions here. One on Cepheid, are you able to kind of comment on how much was flu versus normalized growth in the quarter? And then as we think about Beckman, you’re still on kind of low single-digit core growth here. You highlighted some of the new assays. Obviously, there’s some new competitive platforms that have been brought to market. Can you maybe just talk about how you feel about the competitive positioning of the Beckman instrument side? And are you investing enough there at the moment?
Tom Joyce: Sure. So on Cepheid, obviously a huge quarter for Cepheid at 40% growth. The flu impact was an important driver there. If you netted for flu, you’re probably still talking about mid-teens growth at Cepheid during the quarter. I think what’s also important to recognize though, Tycho, about our performance at Cepheid in the quarter is, starting with flu, again that was not only a function of the seasonality, but we believe based on new customer penetration, adoption of molecular, particularly in different care settings that we took share associated with flu. And so that bodes well for continued growth over the years. Secondly, we saw growth geographically as well as across a number of different product lines. I would point certainly to sexual health as being one of those particular areas. We saw growth not only in core labs and central labs at hospitals, but we saw that in some of the more decentralized care settings as well. So I think a number of factors there that contribute to a continuing very positive outlook. Around Cepheid’s performance in terms of commercial execution and new test execution. The new test that I talked about in terms of the CLIA-waived test associated with the Xpert Xpress Flu, also again a contributor, but a number of other assays coming through the pipeline that I think bode well for continued good performance at Cepheid. Turning to Beckman, I think there’s a number of good things going on there. I mentioned in my comments earlier about growth in clinical chemistry, immunoassay and urinalysis, another good quarter of high single-digit or better growth in high-growth markets. China, India, Latin America all showing good performance, specifically around IA and urinalysis, high single-digit or better the last three years. So in those market segments where you get better underlying growth rates from a market standpoint, we are performing well. Positive growth in clinical chemistry, which I think builds on the 2017 momentum, which was the first year of growth since, I think, 2014. And competitively, I think I would probably point most specifically to hematology, which is where we’ve been most challenged, again a smaller – the smallest portion of the business against – at least relative to IA and clinical chemistry. And that’s where we’ve had some real competitive challenges. I think there’s a lot of good news going on there. We’ve launched the DxH 500 as well as the DxH 520. Those are two new hematology instruments. And particularly important is the new form factor associated with those, not only good performance but smaller footprint, which makes a big difference to our end users. And then finally, we’ve got a new DxH 900 coming out with some unique capabilities associated with sepsis diagnoses. And I think a combination of those things over the next, I would say, year or two as those become seeded in the market will improve our competitive position. And that area has been the most significant area of competitive challenge for us in the last – well, really probably since we acquired the business.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Tycho.
Operator: We’ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Hi, good morning guys and congrats.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Muken: So on the high-growth market side, it seems pretty broad-based. It sounds like a lot of the businesses had pretty good results in China. It also feels like Cepheid’s opportunity, particularly into HGM, is maybe one of the largest you’ve had for a deal for some time. So help us tease out kind of the underlying versus kind of what you’re getting maybe incrementally from some of these recent acquisitions that were more domestic or Europe-based, where you’re seeing pretty good sell-through into markets that you obviously have a much better channel into.
Tom Joyce: Yes. Ross, it was a good quarter broadly across the geographies. I mentioned some of this. But just a quick recap that the U.S. was a low single-digit market but pretty good and pretty consistent performance across our businesses. Europe was a bright spot with mid-single-digit growth in Europe and good performance across a number of businesses. And then to your question around the high-growth markets, China was double digits for the fifth quarter in a row and pretty broad-based with all five platforms double digits or better in terms of – into the teens and beyond. India was also a double-digit market and it has been very good for us. We’ve seen improvement in some markets that had some challenges over the last couple of years, Russia has shown improvement. Eastern Europe is better. Latin America, not bad, we’ve seen some improvement in Brazil with some weakness in Mexico. That really leaves out the Middle East, which is still a pretty soft market. I didn’t touch on Japan, which is roughly low single digits but no big changes. As it relates to newly acquired businesses, Cepheid, big opportunity in China. We’ve 3x-ed the sales force, admittedly starting from a small base. So those multiples will continue going forward throughout this year. That will be a big growth in our sales force there. We’re limited in terms of test registrations right now in China for Cepheid. So driving incremental tests through registration will allow us to fully take advantage of those incremental sales forces as they come online. So I think there’s been good opportunity there. We’ve seen good performance at Pall, going back an acquisition now, in terms of geographic expansion and Phenomenex as well. If you go all the way back to the Nobel acquisition, they had some real weaknesses in a number of markets, not just in the high-growth markets. And by expanding the sales force in a number of places and using the tools of DBS from a growth perspective, that’s been a big help in terms of getting Nobel’s growth going from about flat when we acquired it to now mid-single digits. So I think you can think about a number of our acquisitions as being underpenetrated in a number of markets. And that has been a source of growth for several of them. I’ll conclude – sorry for the long-winded answer here. But IDT just very briefly, new acquisition. IDT is a very U.S.-centric business, a great business. But probably 3/4, 75% of the balance of sale is U.S.-based or North American-based. So again, another opportunity to leverage our footprint and the large footprint that we have in our Life Science platform to try and expand the reach of a great commercial front end that we have at IDT.
Ross Muken: Tom, you stole the follow-up question I was going to ask you on IDT into non-U. S. But maybe just quickly, can you just give us a feel on that one on IDT? That’s a very unique business, custom oligos, fantastic market share. It’s probably the best in the world at what it does by far. How does that sort of fit into kind of your portfolio? It’s kind of a unique business. And sort of what else are you going to be doing, I guess, around molecular biology, sequencing, PCR, synthetic biology, all the areas they kind of play into that maybe aren’t areas we’ve traditionally thought of you being a leader in?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Ross. It fits in, in such a number of different ways, starting with how attractive the market is in which IDT plays and the leadership position that it commands in that very attractive market. Just for context, the genomics reagent market is about a $3 billion market growing double digits with some great secular growth drivers around. And you mentioned a couple of these, next-gen sequencing, gene editing, qPCR, not to mention sort of basic oligos. And of course, over time, we’ll see the growth in synthetic biology. And so into this great market, you have this leading player, IDT, generally a founder-built – a founder-led business over a number of years, building a leadership position around quality, turnaround time, all of which then leads to tremendous brand identity. Their Net Promoter Scores, Ross, were as probably as high as any Net Promoter Scores I’ve seen in a newly acquired business in a long, long time. And all that sort of then combines to deliver this terrific mid-teens kind of growth rate over the last several years and really strong gross margins at north of 60%. And so when you step back from this, IDT really brings to our Life Science platform a position in high-value consumables with a tremendous commercial front end that has delivered consistent performance over a long period of time. We think there’s opportunities for us to add incremental value here. We talked certainly about expanding geographically being one. But there’s also opportunities for DBS to play a role here, both in terms of operational improvements, and in addition to that, on the growth side. So we think it fits extraordinarily well with a number of the growth areas in Life Sciences and really fills what otherwise you would have said would have been a bit of a void in terms of addressing the high-growth consumables positions in those high-growth segments.
Ross Muken: Great. And maybe just one quick clarification, I wasn’t sure if I missed it. Did you update the full year organic guide?
Tom Joyce: Well, we certainly aren’t talking about the 3.5% that we had in the prior guide, Ross. We did say that we expected roughly 4% core growth here in the second quarter. We’re not even four months into the year here. And so I think as we get a little bit deeper here into the second quarter, we’ll get a look at what we think is going to happen in the back half of the year. But we feel very good about the momentum we’re building and feel very good about where we are going here into the second quarter.
Ross Muken: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: We’ll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hi good morning. Some good information. So I’m going to go a little bit over to the industrial side. And would you characterize Pall Industrial as kind of accelerating, stable or some other description? It wasn’t totally clear in the remarks.
Tom Joyce: I think there’s a number of areas of improvements there, Scott. I think one of the areas that I highlighted was microelectronics. That’s been a bright spot within Pall’s more industrial and process-oriented business for quite a while now. And we see that sustaining itself behind really good execution and some new products as well. But I think beyond that, what we’ve really seen is some improvements in commercial execution and some improvements in new product development that are combining to intersect with what I think are some improving market dynamics. You may recall, our timing wasn’t exactly brilliant in terms of the industrial slowdown that took place not long after the Pall acquisition closed. And so that segment of the business struggled a bit, not only from its historically poor execution, but that market dynamic, I think we have seen improvement in both that bodes well for contributing – a continuing contribution to Pall’s improving growth rate.
Scott Davis: I mean, if you go back and you look at your original Pall assumptions and your deal model, I mean, are we catching up to the deal model despite the cyclical downdraft? Or are we…
Dan Comas: Yes, I think we’re tracking well to the deal model. We’re a little behind on revenue because of the industrial side. We’re back to kind of close to the low to mid-single-digit growth at the industrial side. But we’re well ahead on the cost side. So overall, we’re very pleased on how we’re tracking versus our expectations. Particularly now that we’ve had a couple of quarters of mid-single-digit growth on the industrial side, the growth equation’s playing out well. And clearly, we’re far ahead on the margin side.
Scott Davis: Right. And everything looked great, except Dental, obviously again. And every company has something that’s not going right, right? But this has been a business that’s not been going right for a while. Is there an end of your patience? Is there kind of a tipping point, I would say, where you’d say, " Hey, maybe this is just in the hands – better in the hands of someone else"?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Scott, my patience or tolerance for a business that is in a challenged position is largely a function of whether or not we have the right kind of vision for areas for improvement and whether we’re making progress moving down that path towards that vision. And I think in a number of areas, we’ve shown really good progress in terms of both the cost side, where we’ve rationalized a platform that had not been rationalized for a long, long time, consolidating operating companies from 10 to 4, consolidating sites, manufacturing sites and back offices by over 1/3 and then investing for new product innovation and starting to get some growth associated with those. So I think we’re making good progress. And that allows us to have a bit of patience for that. Now that being said, it is always a topic in our boardroom as to the overall portfolio of Danaher. And you know our track record, Scott, as well as anybody that we are continually evaluating businesses, individual operating companies and even platforms in terms of their long-term potential and whether they’re in the right hands, to use your term. And that is not just a topic that we discuss from time to time. It’s always on the table. And so we’ll continue to evaluate that, continue to evaluate our progress and continue to evaluate the overall dental market and how to position our Dental business for the highest return to shareholders.
Scott Davis: Great. Well good luck guys and we’re in for year some keep it up.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Scott.
Operator: We’ll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Good morning. My first question is on EPS guidance. You increased full year guidance for EPS at the midpoint by about $0.12. Q1 contributed about $0.08 to this. You should add a few cents of accretion for the IDT acquisition. So it doesn’t look like full year EPS guidance for the base business was meaningfully increased for the balance of 2018. It certainly sounds like most businesses are at least holding serve with solid momentum. So is updated EPS guidance a function of conservatism? Is there some incremental investment that’s now planned? Or is there some other dynamic at play that we should be contemplating?
Dan Comas: Doug, I guess the way that I would look at it is we raised the midpoint by $0.12. We beat the first quarter versus consensus by about $0.05 or $0.06. So there’s maybe $0.06 or $0.07 coming from a combination of general confidence with the order book and margins, currency, inclusion – obviously, inclusion of IDT. But we also recognize that if this positive environment continues, that will allow us some additional degrees of freedom here to potentially, as you point out, to accelerate some of our growth investments.
Doug Schenkel: Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to dig in a bit more on Diagnostics, specifically Beckman Coulter in North America. It looks like Beckman Diagnostics' revenue had modest declines in North America and developed markets. Could you provide a bit more detail on what the key drivers there were and if these declines are expected to continue for the balance of 2018? And relatedly, are you seeing pricing renewal or win rates being impacted by PAMA? And I guess, as long as I’m going along these lines, did flu negatively impact Beckman volumes in any ancillary businesses? Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Doug. First, in terms of North America, North America has historically been, going all the way back to when we acquired Beckman, the most challenging market for us. That business was in decline in North America when we acquired the business. We track the – our retention of customers and our win rates very closely in each one of the markets. And we’ve been very encouraged by the progress that we’ve made in North America associated with retention and with new customer win rates. Our strength has typically come from our core businesses around immunoassay and clinical chemistry with the addition of Iris in urinalysis, an acquisition we did following Beckman, as well as the microbiology business, we’ve strengthened our offering in North America now. As I mentioned relative to, I think, Tycho’s question earlier, the challenge has really been around hematology. And that’s where our retention and our win rates have been the most challenged. And that’s where we’ve put a great deal of energy and investment associated with new product development to better position ourselves for improved competitiveness in North America. So that’s the way I’d probably characterize it. I think you’re on the right track in terms of that particular geography being one of our biggest opportunities for improvement. And I think we’re making progress there. Relative to PAMA, Doug, we’ve seen very little impact of PAMA to this point. Certainly, we’ve had some dialogue about PAMA with a number of key customers. I think they understand well the impact that PAMA has, at least associated with a fairly narrow segment of our business. Remember, I guess, for others on the call, PAMA impacts only U.S. businesses, U.S. Diagnostic businesses. Only 40% of our Diagnostic business at Beckman is in the U.S. And of that business in the U.S., 75% of it is in the hospital. And PAMA, the cuts in reimbursement associated with PAMA, are associated with generally outpatient testing. And so the impact has been fairly modest at this point. We expect those – the dialogue around PAMA to continue this year associated with the contract renewals. But we think we understand what that modest impact might look like and are managing to that accordingly. And then in terms of the flu impact across the overall market, we didn’t see the higher level of spend associated with flu, Doug, as having any negative impact on the rest of our sell in to our end users. So in general, we saw that flu as largely incremental, driven by obviously the challenging nature of the season itself but also associated with our good execution associated with new customer penetration and new test menu.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll go next to Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you, very much. So I guess my first question would really be on the Environmental & Applied Solutions business, which I don’t think has been really touched on so far. Really it’s around the core margins. That performance year-on-year at least has been fairly sluggish in the past two quarters. I think you talked about higher investment spend back in January. But I also noticed that pricing was a big tailwind in Q1. But you only saw a, I think, a 15 bps core margin expansion. So I wondered if you could give an update on the investments in that segment, but also whether there’s some price-cost dynamic that’s crimping margins as well.
Tom Joyce: Julian, thanks for that question. And by the way, I know the follow-up questions are not the problem. It’s my long answers that are probably the problem, so sorry for that. We have really strong margins across EAS, generally. It’s a 22% margin platform in the most recent period. And the margins were down a bit in the quarter. There was acquisition impact that probably had about 75 basis points associated with some recent deals over at water, like AppliTek and Kipp & Zonen, that come in at lower margins. The core operating margins were up, up modestly and probably in the area of 15 to – 15 basis points or so. And so we did, during the course, given the strength of other businesses in the quarter, accelerate some restructuring in the platform in a couple of areas. And we did make some incremental investments in Q1, including R&D as a percent of sales that stepped up about 50 points. So if you set aside those items, the core operating margin would have been up closer to 50 basis points. There was actually a pricing contribution there as well. We – given that we’re in a bit more of an inflationary environment today, we do have a number of our businesses being what I think is very thoughtful about – about using price, again where it’s well justified and where we’ve got strength to deal with it at the end user level. A couple of examples of that would be clearly at Videojet, where we’re seeing price readthrough, and at ChemTreat as well. Obviously, ChemTreat being a little bit more oriented to chemical pricing associated with their consumables, I think we’re on a firm foundation of going out and getting price there as it’s well justified. So those are a few of the moving parts associated with what obviously, at a print level, were some down margins.
Julian Mitchell: Very helpful thanks. And my follow-up would just be when we’re looking at the second quarter guidance on core growth, what sort of leveling out or abatement of the core sales decline does that assume happens within Dental and whether that’s more pronounced on the equipment side or traditional consumables in terms of that improvement of the year-on-year trend from Q1?
Tom Joyce: We’re looking at Dental as being roughly flattish in the second quarter. And that would reflect continued good performance of our specialty consumables businesses, like Nobel, that I mentioned, grew mid-single digits in the quarter, and the consumable and equipment side of KaVo Kerr being down marginally.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Julian
Operator: We’ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Steve
Steve Beuchaw: Hi, thanks for the time. And good morning here. I just wanted to try to unpack a couple of things that have come up on the call. The first was, in your prepared remarks, Tom, you made mention of an expectation within the context of Pall and bioprocess and single-use for an acceleration over the balance of the year. It’s consistent with what you’ve been calling for, I think, dating back to December in the Analyst Day. But I wonder if you can give us just a little bit more insight into how you’ve seen that evolve here through the first several months of the year.
Tom Joyce: Steve, we’ve seen order rates continue to improve across bioprocessing. You probably remember well, we saw those order rates soften in 2017, certainly through the middle to latter part of the year. They have continued to improve both across the more general filtration, let’s call it filtration side of bioprocessing but also specifically around single-use. Single-use has been pretty strong and pretty consistently strong. But we’ve seen that continue to grow as we see incremental customers adopting the single-use technologies as they get into smaller batch sizes associated with large-molecule drugs. So overall, we feel pretty positive about the continued performance at Pall on that side of the business.
Steve Beuchaw: And then just to circle back to Dental to make sure that we understand the trends to the extent that we can, excluding the impact of some of these near-term transition points. Can you give us a sense for maybe with a little bit more specificity where the sellout was in the quarter? I want to say it was in the 3, 3.5 neighborhood for 4Q. Are we still in that ballpark? And then as it relates to the impact of inventory, are we thinking about inventory this year as being a bigger headwind than we were before? Or is it just more accelerated into the front part of the year as you guys have worked with your distribution partners there? Thanks so much.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Steve. First, on that last point, no, I would not say inventory is a bigger challenge there. I’d say it’s probably modestly lesser of a challenge. Yes, we did accelerate some of what we otherwise would have been working with the channel to reduce over the full year and move that into the first quarter, given the strength that we had in a number of our other businesses. So I think we feel pretty good about that. These inventory management challenges with the distribution channel are – they’re just – they’re part of doing business in a market where essentially distributors play a key value-added role across a large segment of the overall market. And so we understand that it’s a partnership, and we work on these things together. As we work to help them manage inventories effectively, they work with us to help drive sellout. And the more effectively we drive sellout, obviously that takes care of some of that inventory challenge that wouldn’t otherwise come out of our top line. So hopefully, we see the benefits of all that come together as the rest of the year progresses, and we expect that we will. Relative to sellout, I mentioned that we saw some improvement in consumables sellout. And I think to get any deeper than that into an individual product category, you could probably come back to Matt later on in the day, and we could probably take you through some of the individual categories on the consumables side in terms of whether it was in endo or restoratives, et cetera.
Steve Beuchaw: Thanks so much, Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: We’ll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. So I’m surprised no one has asked the China trade and tariff question yet, so I will do that one at this point. Obviously, I mean, I assume some of your conservatism in the organic revenue growth, sort of maintaining it where it is at the 3.5%, 4% level now is sort of driven by some concerns over the geopolitical outlook and tariffs and trade and fiscal policy. Could you sort of walk through sort of what your current thoughts on that, sort of your analysis on what could be impacted in the sort that we go to a hotter trade war?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, I’m sure I speak for a lot of businesses, far beyond our businesses today, to say that the narrative around tariffs and trade, and even – I’d even go so far as even to go to the interest rates today, altogether make for a bucket of uncertainty associated with the balance of this year. And so I think we can only hope that, that narrative kind of settles to a point where the execution side is not disruptive. Specific to tariffs, where I think you started the question, we – based on what we know right now, which is pretty limited, right, there’s a lot of uncertainty still about what actually gets implemented and the timing of what gets implemented. But that being said, if you just took the narrative that’s been put out to this point, our exposure would be very modest. We have a tremendous business in China. We do about $2 billion of revenue in China. But we have a fairly modest exposure to any of the product categories, let alone specific codes, that would be reflected in any of these onerous tariffs that might be inbound into China. On the opposite side, in terms of what we export from China and into the U.S., that’s an even more modest number. Of course, our business being so highly skewed towards consumables, high gross margins, low materials content, particularly low content in some of the more basic materials, like steel and aluminum, altogether would suggest a fairly modest impact. But we will continue to monitor it closely. We know these things can change literally in a day. And we’ll stay very close to it.
Dan Comas: And Derik, I mean, obviously if it sort of got ugly, which it could, I think as Tom alluded to, given sort of high gross margin consumables that don’t have a lot of material content typically, we have a lot less exposure than other companies. And because of the nature of those products, I think we could be more nimble in moving production around if we had to, to sort of deal with some of that. You also made, I think, in the introductory comment made some comments that we’re holding to 3.5% to 4%. I think to be clear, if we were giving guidance for the full year, we would not be talking about 3.5%. I just want to make sure to provide that clarification.
Derik De Bruin: Okay. Great that’s helpful appreciated.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Derik.
Operator: We’ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Erin.
Erin Wright: Thanks, good morning. In Dental, what do you think the long-term growth rate is, I guess, for the U.S. geographic segment in Dental? And do you think that this could be a GDP-plus kind of grower longer term? I guess, how are you characterizing kind of the current underlying demand trends? And when do you think that could potentially turn, or visibility thereon? Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Erin, I think the long-term growth rate to think about specific to the U.S. is probably a 2% to 3% growth rate if you’re talking about the core traditional consumables and equipment business. So that doesn’t make it a GDP-plus, it makes it more like a GDP kind of business. That being said, the specialty consumables side, for example, like our implant business at Nobel and its value businesses that are associated with it, like Implant Direct and ABT, those combine to participate in much more of a mid-single-digit market and in certain geographies, a high single-digit market. Again, if you go back to traditional consumables and equipment that’s – that’s that low single-digit kind of growth rate in the U.S., those same product lines are growing double digits in China. And so I think when you look at the overall Dental platform, while the U.S. business – the U.S. market in those more traditional categories may be an uninspiring one, I think the broader categories in some of the broader geographies really make for a much more attractive global market.
Erin Wright: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then following IDT, can you speak to kind of the capital deployment focus near term and longer term here, capacity for potential acquisitions as well? Thanks.
Dan Comas: Sure, Erin. I mean, clearly given how we got out of the gate from a free cash flow perspective it really puts us in a good position. It’s not unreasonable to think by the time we get to June, we’ll have funded 80% of the IDT purchase price. So I think despite the IDT acquisition, we’re back to what we’re saying 4, 5 months ago, which is we’re quite comfortable spending our free cash flow plus going forward here. And we’re excited about some of the things out there. And we continue to be very active. So this is not like a Pall or a Cepheid-type situation, where there was a pause because of the size of the deals. Obviously, IDT is a little stronger; two, our free cash flow is better. We’re right back at it, looking at sizable opportunities.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Erin.
Erin Wright: Okay, thank you.

Tom Joyce: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in to the details of the quarter, I’d like to touch briefly on the announcement we made this morning regarding our CFO transition plan. As I’m sure many of you saw, we announced that Matt McGrew, our current Group CFO of our diagnostics and dental platforms will succeed Dan Comas as Chief Financial Officer of Danaher on January 1 of 2019. Dan will continue on as an Executive Vice President and a member of the office of the Chief Executive post January 1, 2019, as he begins a gradual transition to retirement. Dan, it goes without saying that it has been and will continue to be a privilege working with you. For the past 27 years, all of us at Danaher have valued your outstanding financial stewardship, thoughtful guidance and longtime friendship. Danaher would not be where it is today without your leadership, strategic vision, and humility. We are also very pleased that you’ll continue to work with us post-2018 to ensure a seamless CFO transition and provide a strategic counsel we value so highly.  Many of you know Matt McGrew from his time as Vice President of Investor Relations. But Matt has had a number of important roles during his past 14 years with Danaher. Matt is uniquely qualified to take on the positon of CFO, as he will be able to leverage his extensive Danaher experience in internal audit, M&A, investor relations and as Group CFO with operational experience across four of our five platforms.  Throughout his tenure with Danaher, Matt has consistently demonstrated superior leadership and played an integral role in the company’s growth both organically and inorganically. We look forward to helping Matt transition to this important role with Dan’s guidance and strategic counsel.  With that lets’ get to our results. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance, as the team delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, solid margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. These results capped a solid year for Danaher and we’re very encouraged by the momentum we built throughout 2017.  2017 was a great example of how we run the Danaher playbook. We improved gross margins to nearly 56%, lowered G&A, increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to drive accelerating core growth, all while delivering 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This operating model continues to demonstrate how we build a better, stronger Danaher.  For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, organic growth investments and good commercial execution helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth, including mid-single digit growth in three out of our four reporting segments. Our total annual revenues are now nearly $18.5 billion. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2017, resulting in mid-teens growth year-on-year that helps position us for more significant capital deployment in 2018. Our free cash-to-net income conversion ratio was 117%, and 2017 represents the 26th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. From an M&A perspective, we deployed nearly $400 million of capital in 2017 on 10 strategic bolt-on acquisitions, each of which will help enhance their respective platforms. We also remain encouraged by the great performance at our most recently acquired larger businesses, Cepheid, Phenomenex, PALL and Nobel Biocare.  Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 11% to $5.1 billion, as the impact of currency translation increased revenue by 3% and acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%. Core revenue increased 5.5%, led by four of our five platforms that grew between 5.5% and 7.5%.  Geographically high growth markets grew high single digits with China and India continuing to lead the way. In developed markets, we saw acceleration as both the US and Western Europe were up mid-single digits.  Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.8%, an increase of 130 basis points, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points led by our life sciences and diagnostics platforms. These margin results are a testament to our teams’ consistent execution using the tools of the Danaher business system. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.19, bringing full year adjusted EPS to $4.03 both representing double digit growth year-on-year. Now let’s take a more detailed look at fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 12% and core revenue grew 7.5%, which marks the platforms highest quarterly core growth rate in over four years. Life sciences operating profit margin was 20%, with both core and reported operating margins increasing over 300 basis points. This increase was broad based across the platform driven primarily by outstanding DBS execution, new product innovations and better than expected topline performance.  Beckman Life Sciences delivered high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by ongoing strong performance in our Flow Cytometry and particle counting businesses. We believe the Beckman team continues to take market share driven by improved commercial execution and new product innovations.  Over the past three years, Beckman has refreshed its portfolio launching approximately 20 new products. Several of these new products address higher growth areas such as biologic and genomic work flows, setting the business up well for continued strong performance.  Leica Microsystem’s core revenue was up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe and China, primarily in the medical and research end markets. Core revenue at Sciex increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets. In addition, Phenomenex had a very good quarter, growing core revenue high single digits as both Sciex and Phenomenex are starting to leverage each other’s go-to-market capabilities.  At Pall, core revenue grew nearly 10%, its best quarterly growth rate since we acquired the business as our microelectronics and single use technologies businesses continued to perform very well. In addition, biopharma and process and industrial finished the year on a strong note, as these businesses rebounded nicely from the hurricane disruptions that impacted third quarter results.  In October, our life sciences platform successfully closed the acquisition of IDBS, a software informatics leader in the life science space. IDBS’s software provides a data management platform enabling its research customers to better capture, manage and report on scientific insights. This platform in combination with our life sciences instrumentation will enable researches to accelerate their innovation efforts helping to make better and faster scientific decisions.  Moving now to diagnostics, reported revenues increased 13.5% and core revenue increased 6%. Core operating margin grew by 105 basis points and reported operating margin increased 690 basis points to 19.5%. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew at low single digit rate led by solid growth in our immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry product lines. Regionally the growth was driven by China and Latin America.  At Radiometer, core revenue increased mid-single digits in the quarter, as both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single digit core revenue growth, led by increased demand in both our advanced staining and core histology product lines. Growth was broad based across most regions, with particular strength in North America and Western Europe.  Turning to Cepheid, the team had an outstanding quarter. Core revenue increased greater than 25% driven by growth in all major product lines and geographies. For the full year 2017, Cepheid’s core revenue grew approximately 20%, which is almost double the expected rate from when we announced the acquisition. This outperformance was driven by a combination of strong commercial execution, test menu expansion and an ever increasing installed base of instruments.  Overall it was a tremendous first year at Cepheid, with DBS helping to deliver improvements across the company. Since we acquired the business last November, Cepheid has achieved 400 basis points of gross margin expansion, increased operating margins from just above breakeven in to the mid-teens and improved on-time delivery by over 1500 basis points.  The team has also meaningfully embraced two key commercial DBS growth tools, transformative marketing and funnel management. These tools have helped Cepheid expand its market visibility, generate more potential leads and increase the number of new customers they are serving. As a result, we believe Cepheid continues to expand its leading market position and gain market share.  Turning to our dental segment, reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down slightly. Dental operating profit margin was 13.1% as both core and reported operating margins declined. By product line, performance was in line with our expectations. Growth in our specialty consumables businesses, implants and orthodontics was offset by declines in equipment and traditional consumables.  As expected the declines in traditional consumable growth rate has started to moderate, however, our equipment business was negatively impacted by the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacture relationships. We anticipate these difficult market conditions to persist through the first half of 2018.  We continue to be pleased with the performance in our specialty consumables businesses. Nobel Biocare in particular had a great quarter, growing core revenue high single digits driven by North America and China. December marked the three-year anniversary of the Nobel acquisition, and they’ve made tremendous progress.  Not only has the team meaningfully improved operating margins, but has also increased R&D spend by approximately 20%, launched more than 25 new products and increased their sales force by 15% over the past two years. These growth initiatives along with the execution of DBS tools to streamline sales from our proxies and increase new customer starts has helped Nobel pose mid-single digit core growth in each of the last two years.  Moving now to our environmental and applied solutions segment, reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin declined by 50 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 23.1%, driven primarily by increased productivity initiatives and a deafening spend within our water quality platform.  In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by strong demand from marking and coating equipment and related consumables. The out-growth in our packaging and color solutions offerings was attributed to increased demand in North America and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased high single digits in the quarter, with broad based growth across most major product lines and geographies. The fourth quarter capped off another great year for Videojet as the business continued to compound returns and gain market share.  Over the past five years, Videojet has averaged mid-single digit core revenue growth, continued to expand margins and also completed a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions. One of those acquisitions Laetus had its best quarter of core revenue growth since we acquired the business in 2015. As a reminder Laetus is a leading supplier of track and trade inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants.  With the help of DBS tools Laetus has generated greater market awareness and demand within the pharmaceutical tracking vertical and we believe is well positioned for growth going forward. In our packaging and color solutions businesses, core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, while X-Rite was up low-single digits.  Finally, turning to our quality, core revenue growth for the platform at a mid-single digit rate. Hach had its best quarter of the year, with core revenue growing mid-single digits. This growth was drive by solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets, with strength in Western Europe and China.  Hach also continued its healthy cadence of Bolton acquisitions, closing two deals in the quarter, AppliTek and Kipp & Zonen. AppliTek is a leading provider of wet chemistry process analyzers and integrated systems that will help Hach offer a broader suite of parameters to its core industrial and municipal customers. Kipp & Zonen specializes in making instrumentation that’s relied upon by meteorologist through applications such as climate research, water resource management and materials testing.  Kipp & Zonen will join Hach’s environmental business and nicely complement our existing offerings, providing us an opportunity to deliver enhanced customer solutions. We are excited to welcome both teams to Danaher.  At Chemtreat, core revenue grew at a low single digit rate, driven by increases in the food, steel and oil and gas end markets, primarily in North America. It’s worth noting that 2017 marks Chemtreat’s 50th consecutive year of revenue growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team’s commitment to continue its improvement and their best-in-class commercial execution.  Lastly, Trojan had a great quarter delivering double digit core growth, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Trojan continues to execute very well significantly improving customer win rates to help drive share gains relative to its markets.  So to wrap up, we’re very pleased with our fourth quarter results, capping off a good year for Danaher and helping to build momentum as we start 2018. In 2017, the team delivered double digit adjusted EPS growth; meaningful margin improvement and cash flow generation and saw core revenue growth accelerate through the year.  We also executed on a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions, continued to focus on integration of our recent larger deals and we now have a balance sheet that positions us well for a more significant capital deployment in 2018.  As we look ahead, we believe that the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to achieve long term shareholder value creation. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.90 and $0.93, which assumer core growth of 3.5% to 4%.  We continue to expect full year 2018 core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.25 and $4.35. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we are now ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: Let’s step back just a bit, the step up in core growth was pretty exceptional really, but can you walk us around the world, I wasn’t clear where the positive surprises came from globally. By business it was clear, but let’s clear globally. 
Tom Joyce : Scott it was really very positive on a global basis. Of course I think we all know from a macro perspective we’re in a unique time, right, we’re in a time of globally synchronous economic expansion. And I think in many respects our businesses are well positioned to take advantage of that growth rate on a global basis across all the many markets in which we participate.  What we saw in the fourth quarter was continued good performance in the high growth markets, with exceptional growth in China, in India, as we’d seen consistently throughout the course of the year, some improving performance in places like Latin America and Russia, and frankly still some softness in places like the Middle East.  But I think what was maybe a bit more noteworthy than the continued good performance in the high growth markets was the incremental strength that we saw in the developed markets. In the US and in Europe both of those markets up mid-single digits is I think where the real difference is on a global basis. Now clearly our businesses were well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in each of those markets. We saw obviously particular strength in our life science businesses and our diagnostic businesses, up north of 7% and 6% respectively, improved performance sequentially in our water quality business which we expected, and consistent performance in product identification.  So I think overall pretty well in line with what’s happening in the macro from a geographic perspective, but I think clearly four to five platforms incredibly well positioned relative to those macro drivers. 
Scott Davis: So that just begs the natural question of when you think about your guidance 3.5% to 4%. That first half of the year you’ve got reasonably easy comps and you made positive comments about the global macro. Is there something you’ve seen January that leads to be a little bit more conservative or is this just the standard Danaher, it’s still early in the year, let’s wait and see before we raise that guidance. 
Tom Joyce : I wouldn’t say it’s anything in particular that we’ve seen on a near-term basis Scott. I think it’s much more to the latter point you made, which is it’s very early in the year. We are encouraged by obviously the finish we saw. What little we’ve seen of January to this point gives us encouragement as well. And I think it’s just early at this point and obviously we’ll be updating throughout the course of the year. But I think for now we feel very good about the guidance that we have and we’ll watch carefully as this quarter unfolds. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. 
Tycho Peterson: Question on in terms of the delta relative to our model life science certainly stood out. You called out Beckman life science, Phenomenex. Can you quantify what Pall life sciences was up and then was there any catchup affect from 3Q there that you can quantify and any budget flush dynamic that you’re willing to call out. 
Tom Joyce : So our best stance was the life science was up 7.5%, there was probably about a point benefit, kind of a hurricane recovery, so call it ex hurricane recovery more like 6.5%. That was also followed through with very strong orders. We were I think as we went into the beginning in January slightly worried that there were some budget flush, but our January orders have remained very strong. That’s not only life science but more broadly. 
Tycho Peterson: And then a question on Cepheid, obviously this has done incredibly well. I’m just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on how much of this is coming from new cartridge launches versus flu trends versus [HVDC][ph] and some of these other markets.
Tom Joyce : We saw a really broad based strong performance from Cepheid. There were a number of factors that I think contributed to that. Not the least of which certainly was enhanced commercial execution. One of the things we tracked at Cepheid is our installed base and our new customer addition, and since we’ve acquired the business, new customer additions are plus 15% since we acquired the business.  I think menu is certainly a contributor with Xpress flu, with Flu/RSV, with strep test all introduced in 2017, all making a difference. Yes, continued strength in the hybrid in developing countries but very good strength in the developed markets as well. Clearly we are in the midst of at least certainly from a patient perspective a very challenging flu season.  And yes that does drive growth at Cepheid. But I think if you step back and you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, that performance is driven far beyond the early strength of the flu season and really represents I think a number of both commercial execution enhancement and menu expansions that have driven growth in the installed base. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Maybe on dental right, some of the underlying trends particularly in the recently acquired business and Nobel seems better, but obviously some of the noise still exist with the channel and maybe on sort of basic consumables. I guess based on what you’ve seen kind of closing the year to start of the year. I mean in terms of cadence and in terms of your thoughts on how some of the changes you’ve made over time are starting to playout and the pieces where you’ve been able to influence it versus maybe some of the market factors you don’t have control on. And what’s your sort of updated thoughts on how that’s gone and in terms of maybe some of the small wins it seems like you’re getting in pieces like Nobel. 
Tom Joyce : The fourth quarter played out pretty much in line with what we expected. I think we all know that 2017 was clearly a difficult year in the industry. But there are a number of things that actually are quite encouraging for us. Starting with especially consumables business, I mentioned in my comments earlier the terrific performance that we’ve seen in Nobel. We’ve seen very consistent and good performance from Ormco as well.  And those two businesses especially consumables businesses represent half our dental segment. Mid-single digit growth across that group of businesses combined in the fourth quarter with Nobel being high single digits, and there’s no question I think those are some pretty attractive markets to participate in.  Could the strength there be taken a little bit of wallet share from some of the more traditional consumables, maybe a little bit tough to pinpoint on that, but in general that half of our segment we were quite encouraged by? High growth markets have continued to perform very well, high single digit growth in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017. And then operational execution, you know we’ve talked in the past and I think we’ve just finished up our second year of talking about our dental platform, approaching the dental platform as a new acquisition. And we’ve done a number of things to right size the cost structure while we invest in over the last couple of years.  We consolidated operating companies from 10 down to four, reduced the manufacturing and back office sites by over nearly a third. Gross margins are up a 100 basis points as a result of a number of those changes and yet we’re still reinvesting. R&D up a 100 basis points as a percent of sales, up 20% in 2017 year-on-year, a whole bunch of new products, 25 new products as I mentioned in Nobel.  So this is a $3 billion platform we have today and admittedly that doesn’t represent an enormous percentage of Danaher and clearly where we’ve seen the weakness in about half of that platform isn’t even a smaller percentage of the overall platform. But these are strong brands and great franchises. Good secular trends around digital dentistry and so on and over all we feel good about the operational improvements and the progress we’re making and we continue to drive to create long term value out of that platform. 
Ross Muken: That’s super helpful and maybe just on the capital allocation front. So you guys free cash continues to be a really tremendous 100% plus of net income. I guess as you’re staring out over the balance of the year, it looks like the leverage levels are going to get back because of manageable place. How are you balancing kind of your balance sheet capacity versus public market multiples, looks like you were a little bit busy on the tuck-in side in the last quarter or two. So help us just think through kind of how that environment looks like for you right now?
Tom Joyce : We feel very good about where we sit today Ross. The 10 acquisitions that we did in the past year were strategic enhancements to a number of our platforms, and the spend that we executed during the course of the year was certainly within the range of the spend that we anticipated during the course of the year, particularly in light of the capital deployment that had preceded that over the couple of years of ’15 and ’16. As we enter 2018, as I mentioned, I think the balance sheet’s in great shape. It positions us now to take advantage of opportunities as they come along. Optimally we would deploy that capital at or above our free cash flow and for deals that really are strategically important to anyone of our platforms today, we’d be willing to stretch that a bit.  So we feel great about how we enter the year. We’ve seen activity pick up a little bit. Second half of the year you saw a little bit more activity in those boltons in the first half of the year, and I think that bodes well for how things might open up here with people feeling good about their own valuations clearly as sellers.  But I think it’s also probably worth noting that now the tax reform has been determined, if you will. That pays a level of uncertainty out of the market, and anytime you eliminate uncertainty, confidence grows and that may help things out as well. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS. 
Steven Winoker: Dan could you maybe give a little more color on the puts and takes around the gross margin, 130 basis points. Obviously you guys are less sensitive in your cost structure to material inflation than a lot of other companies. But maybe just talk about the price productivity mix impact versus other headwinds. 
Dan Comas: You’re right. I mean all up a big part of the driver is the continued expansion of gross margins at Pall. It’s obviously been a multi-year effort. The big step-up, the 400 basis points step up in gross margin at Cepheid is year-on-year are probably the two biggest drivers. We had a 55% gross margin; we just don’t have that much impact from sort of commodities and direct labor inflation. It’s a little bit of a headwind right now, but at t hose levels it’s relatively modest. And clearly when you’re putting together 5.5% core growth, you get very good fall through including on the gross margin side. 
Steven Winoker: And so you expect that to continue?
Dan Comas: Yes, probably not at the – we’re not going to get another 400 basis points step up at Cepheid next year in gross margin, but I think we’re very well positioned from gross margin. And I think as we saw on the operating margin side, as many of you’ll remember, we had negative OMX, core OMX in the first quarter of this year and we still ended up at the high end of our range of 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion. I feel very good about how we are set up in terms of core margin falling in to ’18 including some of the actions we took in the latter part of ’17. 
Steven Winoker: And then maybe just talk through a little more of the margin dynamics gotten it down 50 basis points at Environmental & Applied Solutions. 
Dan Comas: Sure, that was primarily a couple of different factors, Trojan being very strong, a little bit of a negative mix. But the water business particularly Hach came to us kind of early in the fourth quarter with some opportunities both on the growth side and on the cost side to take some actions. It was clear we were having a very good quarter. We let them execute upon those actions both top and bottom line. You did see their growth accelerate. I just saw it for January they had a very strong start to the year. So I think some of their growth investments are still paying off pretty quickly here.  So I’m not concerned. A fair amount of it was kind of orchestrated through the course, given the strength we had. And again we’re not going to have the uplift we have in that segment that we will continue to have in diagnostics and dental. But I think you’ll see more normalized margin improvement across those businesses.  And [PID] had a very good quarter in terms of year, in terms of margins. And I think you’ll see water sort of back on track here starting earlier this year. 
Operator: And we’ll next go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. 
Jeff Sprague: Just a couple of things, just back to tax reform, you guys obviously do a fair amount of boltons and just looking at this provision on deals that are structured as asset deals where you can get immediate expensing of the fixed assets of the target company. I just wondered if you could give us a little context from a Danaher standpoint. On a lot of your bolton deals, typically asset deals and you have the ability to structure them that way, and kind of change the economic lunge you’re looking through when you look at these properties. 
Tom Joyce : Jeff there’s always been an advantage to acquire the assets as oppose to the stock of an entity, perhaps even more so now. I would say that we’re sort of incrementally encouraged versus where we were two months ago generally wrapped around tax reform. We said in December we thought our rate would be 21%. I think it will be probably close to 20% to 21% this year.  We talked about a toll tax being probably in the magnitude of 100 million a year for the next five years. We now think it’s going to be more like 50 million to 60 million. So it’s still like sort of incrementally, and finally to your point, as often been the case, often with acquisitions particularly asset acquisitions there is an opportunity to do even more tax work to potentially lower that ETR even more overtime. 
Jeff Sprague: And then on the investment spend in Environmental and Applied, just wondering is that kind of traditional or restructuring or you’re doing something further drive growth. Obviously the tempo when the business seems like its quite strong, I guess there’s always some belt tightening to do around the edges. But is this more growth oriented or is it more restructuring oriented?
Tom Joyce : It’s little bit of both, more growth oriented, Hach adding both on the R&D side and the feet on the street side. We’re seeing very good numbers on the municipal and the industrial side, they actually got better through the year and we gave some latitude to ramp it up even more in Q4. 
Jeff Sprague: And then finally just on the distributor realignment in dental. Are we just now kind of working through the comparisons associated with the growth realignment that happened in the last several months or so, six months or so, maybe it’s longer than that? And so we’re just kind of working through the annualization of these dynamics or is there still somethings shifting around in the business?
Tom Joyce : Jeff those relationships changed in a formal way at the beginning last year. So we’re about four or five months in two what is a shift in largely exclusive arrangements that involved our relationship with Henry Schein and Dentsply Sirona’s relationship with Patterson. Essentially changing places in terms of a number of equipment related product line particularly around imaging.  When that sort of thing happens, there’s a series of adjustments that need to be made. Some of that comes in the form of inventory, some of that comes in the form of actually sell-out that is associated with sales team, learnings new products, shifting incentives etcetera which can further, along with the inventory adjustment have an impact on sell-in.  So it’s a series of factors that come together that does take a number of months to work its way through the system. At the end of the day the market becomes a little more of a level playing field when you have less exclusive arrangements between manufacturers and distributors. We believe that it will still take better part of the first half of this year for those adjustments to work their way through the system.  In the meantime, we are encouraged by seeing the traditional consumable side, which has been challenged as well moderate a bit in the fourth quarter. We take that altogether and we still think our dental business is likely to be flattish in the first half of this year with the specially tool of business is continuing to perform quite well, the high growth markets continue to perform quite well and much of the operational improvement that we’re putting in place continuing to improve profitability. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Derik De Bruin: Just got a couple, one quick one and then one follow-up. So net interest expense, interest expense, so what’s the guide for ’18 could you remind me?
Dan Comas: 145 million.
Derik De Bruin: And could you talk a little bit about pharma demand. I mean we’re starting to see some big companies talking about increasing their capital allocations and spending. Could you sort of talk about what you sort of see in the pharma space and sort of order pick-ups in that area on the equipment side or what’s on the bio process side? I’m wondering if some of the stuff you’re seeing directly weighted to some of the commentary that we’re hearing on them stepping up on those spend. 
Tom Joyce : We feel good about the overall pharma market today, not just in bio-processing, in biologic demand pharma demand, but across more molecules as well. And we would point to the continued good performance in our equipment businesses at Sciex, at Beckman Life Science, at Phenomenex, at Leica Microsystem. Each of those businesses on the equipment side continuing to perform very well, and not all of those businesses have a significant exposure to the biologic side of life science or certainly pharma as we do say at Pall, where by the way we saw some improved performance clearly in the fourth quarter, obviously not all a function of the recovery from the third quarter hurricane disruptions but in fact we saw good order rate trends around biologic and small molecules, good order rate trend around our single use technologies as well. So on balance I would say, the overall pharma market, biologics and small molecules combined continues to be in pretty good shape. 
Derik De Bruin: And the diagnostics side, any possible CapEx or any PAMA blow back?
Tom Joyce : Not really. Derik, again early relative to PAMA those rates as you know are just going in to place. As I mentioned previously, our exposure there is relatively modest with 60%of our volume outside the United States, this being only a US impact and limited to Medicare reimbursements for outpatient spending which again further mitigates the impact on us.  It’s certainly reasonable to think that customers will leverage the reduction and reimbursement associated with PAMA more broadly, but then again, I don’t think that’s necessarily anything new. I think anytime there are competitive dynamics in a market like the diagnostics market certainly in the central lab there’s going to be some pricing pressure, PAMA will create a little bit of an additional rationale for that. But on a fact basis the exposure there, again US only hospital outpatient and Medicare reimbursement would suggest it’s relatively modest. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. 
Steve Beuchaw: First question is a geographic focused question, because you talked a fair amount here on this call about the developed markets. I wonder if you could spend just a minute or two on China as it didn’t get as much attention on the call. Where in China do you think that we have a particularly good ’18; how are things evolving there; where in China, given some of the liquidity news items out there should we maybe budget in, something that is a little bit moderate relative to ’17.
Tom Joyce : Steve, China has been an important growth driver for us for a number of years. Today we do, I think in excess of $2 billion of revenue in China. We’ve strong positions across each of the platforms and there are extraordinary secular market drivers in China that support our water quality platform with the environmental concerns in China. Product ID even with the growth of the middle class and consumer package goods, diagnostics and life science both receiving significant amount of investment from the Chinese government. And as I’ve mentioned a number of times, our dental business continues to grow high single digits and in certain quarters double digits pretty consistently in China.  So I think if you step back, it’s a boy this is a portfolio that really lines up well with a number of key growth drivers in the Chinese market. In terms of any changes, you have the impact of a relatively new five year plan in China. Again I think that’s going to be supportive broadly across most of our platforms, I don’t think there’s much of a change there.  So in general we feel pretty good about continuing contributions from the Chinese market in each one of the platforms. 
Dan Comas: One of the things that was encouraging in China was we were up double digit for the year and we were basically 10%-11% every quarter through 2017. So it feels like we have pretty good momentum. It’s a bigger base now for that kick down a point or two share, but things are still feeling pretty good over there. 
Steve Beuchaw: Good to hear. One more of a big picture question for Tom, it’s hard not to look at the improvement of organic growth to your core growth in the last couple of quarter, and here the really encouraging commentary on new product flow and execution across the businesses and think, hey vow these guys are seeing some step up in R&D, step up in commercial investment, really pay-off.  It will be helpful just to hear what you’ve learned and how this success, the way I perceive it as a success downstream of an investment effort. How is that changing your thinking if at all about the medium or long term, appropriate level of spend on R&D and sales and marketing in the organization. 
Tom Joyce : Well clearly this has been an evolution for us. Part of that evolution Steve is the evolution of the portfolio. Many of the changes that we’ve made in the portfolio over quite a number of years not just in the last two years or so, but really over the last probably better than five years has set up a portfolio that is really aligned to markets that have a great growth drivers.  I think secondly, we’ve seen an evolution in the Danaher business system, as the tools of DBS have evolved beyond lean in to leadership and most importantly in to growth, and we see the tools of DBS which by the way continued to evolve. Even in 2017, we developed incremental growth tools that are having an impact on each of our businesses from a commercial execution perspective, but also in terms of driving higher rates of innovation.  And I think finally on innovation, I think it has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in our growth rates. And those investments in R&D have paid off and we can point to a number of those examples in our businesses where we see new products from incrementing their growth rates. I point specifically for example the Videojet whose got probably the most robust new product pipeline in its history today with the 1860 fully censored and wired to the internet through greater levels of customer services, Hach’s launch of the [Claro] system leveraging the internet of things as well. So I think the portfolio evolution, the evolution of the tools on the Danaher business system, continued investment in R&D to drive higher rates of innovation, and then finally inorganically obviously the deals we’ve done over the last couple of years have been incremental to our growth rates. You clearly look at the impact of Cepheid and Phenomenex our most recent acquisitions, but certainly Pall and Nobel having an impact. And those 10 strategic Bolton acquisitions, each of those have strategic impacts on our businesses and the ability to drive incremental growth over time through what at times is kind of early stage investment that can drive long term innovation related growth.  So it’s really a combination of things, having learned a lot in the process. Certainly we have, but I think that learning has come really as a function of executing a plan. 
Operator: And we’ll next to Richard Eastman with Baird. 
Richard Eastman: Could we just circle back if you will to the life sciences up margin here in the quarter, and maybe just speak a little bit to Pall, the strength that Pall and the impact of mix on that up margin. I’m curious, Dan you flagged Pall’s gross margin improvement as a big factor in overall margin improvement and expansion. But could you maybe just give us a sense to Pall’s gross margin improvement during and for the full year in calendar ’17.
Dan Comas: As you know Rick when we purchased the business it was a high-teens [OP][ph] business and we’re up a 1000 basis points since the time of the acquisition, and a big chunk of that has been [indiscernible] in the gross margin. I would say that, but one thing that was encouraging in the quarter, was the gross margin improvement in life science is pretty broad based. And none of the businesses grew mid-single digits. Beck life sciences improved their gross margin and then turned their operating margins; we’re seeing the same thing as Sciex good margin expansion.  Though I noted Pall the big driver of the life science improvement. It was this broad based particularly to put up that sort of number as I’ve seen it, and clearly the better core growth helps. Though all those businesses are doing a good job expanding the growth margins, leveraging G&A, they are off stepping up their R&D in sales and marketing. So we’re getting those margins step up. Back to Tom’s point about investing and grow while stepping up our growth investment. 
Richard Eastman: Again when you look at the out margin here, for the fourth quarter assuming Pall, both Pall life sciences as well as PI were stepped up and rebounded, how do you look at the gross margin in the fourth quarter here is maybe a new structural level here to grow off and leverage off with core growth going forward for life sciences?
Dan Comas: Rick I’d have to look at them more carefully. As you know there’s some seasonal benefit in the fourth quarter in life science with equipment sales, which were very strong. But I believe we’ve made a lot of structural changes in the cost profile across life science. And I have to look at it specifically kind of going to the next couple of quarters, but this step up is real. 
Richard Eastman: And then just last question follow-up on dental, if we look at the dental, I think Tom you had suggested maybe first half of ’18 would see flattish revenue. So perhaps a little bit of growth in the back half. But I’m curious when you look at the margin expectation around dental for ’18, do we have enough restructuring, do we have enough growth investment without a great deal of topline to drive 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement in ’18. What does the plan look like given the sales outlook for [dental]?
Tom Joyce : I think we’ve balanced that pretty well over the last couple of years and we’ll continue to do that in 2018. We’ve applied restructuring dollars to drive enhanced productivity in a number of different areas, but at the same time we’ve invested in R&D and we’ve invested in sales and marketing and I’ve cited a number of those numbers as you may recall. And so I think it’s a balance, and I think we shook that balance pretty well in ’16 and ’17 and I don’t anticipate that we will approach any differently in 2018. 
Operator: We’ll take our final question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. 
Doug Schenkel: I’m going to start on Pall; you guys had a solid quarter even normalized for hurricane effect. Your comments earlier on order trends is encouraging. Specific to bio production is it safe to say that you’ve seen an improvement in demands or at least normalization subsequent to some of the customer inventory rebalancing dynamics you mentioned earlier in 2017. 
Tom Joyce : Doug it is safe to say that. It was a solid performance even normalized, the order trends are good and those order trends do point to an improvement in the demand profile, because I think you and others know, we saw a number of customers in that market adjust levels in a couple of cases slow down production during the course of 2017, and I think in the late third quarter and in to certainly the fourth quarter, we saw order trends improve. So we’re encouraged by that. 
Doug Schenkel: And maybe just to close out by going back to something we covered at length earlier in the discussion the topic of 2018 guidance rationale. You were clear in saying that based on what you saw in January you don’t think there was any pull forward of revenue from Q1 in to Q4. And we know you have a history of tending to be prudently conservative with guidance especially earlier in the year.  And that said, I just want to confirm two other things, one, that current FX rates would seemingly cut out as much as $0.10 to full year EPS relative to on the original guidance at least based on our math that those are not fully reflected in current guidance. And second, that you’ve not fully adjusted guidance for the lower tax rate dynamic that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. 
Tom Joyce : Doug let me try to answer that. We have a – it’s been in the 12, 13, 14 years we’ve sort of avoided adjusted December guidance when we get to January. Just feels too early, too quick. I also recognized that January call next year will be Matt McGrew’s first call. So I’m not suddenly looking to sort of change things up here. But you’re right there are some tailwinds out there, whether a Q4 demand, December demand, January numbers, they all point to good numbers.  We are benefitting from the further weakness of the dollar and we are a little more optimistic on the tax rate. Yes, probably a few offsets there, probably a higher share count, but that offsets are modest. So net-net we are feeling pretty good about where we are, and if those good things continue, we’ll have plenty of opportunities to update you through the year. 
Operator: This does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tracey and thanks everyone for joining us. We’re around all day for questions. 
Operator: This does conclude todays’ conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as we delivered mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, strong margin expansion and free cash flow, and improving core revenue growth. Our two most recent larger acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, continue to perform well and both teams have gotten off to a great start as part of Danaher. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, the team's commitment to continuous improvement was a key driver of our results. Our performance in the quarter, combined with a healthy balance sheet, is helping us build momentum for the balance of 2017 and into next year. So with that as a backdrop, let's move into the details of the third quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1 exceeded expectations and represents an increase of 15% over last year. Sales increased 9.5% to $4.5 billion and core revenue grew 3%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 1 percentage point and acquisitions increased revenues by 5.5%. Geographically, core revenue in high growth markets was up high single-digits, led by double-digit gains in China. The developed markets increased at a low-single-digit rate with solid results in the U.S. and Japan. Gross margin was 56%, an increase of 70 basis points from last year. And our reported operating margin was unchanged at 16.9%. Core operating margin increased by almost 100 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. We generated $935 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, resulting in a net income conversion ratio of over 160%. This outstanding free cash flow generation also represents an increase of more than 20% versus last year, and we continue to anticipate double-digit free cash flow growth in 2017. In terms of M&A, so far this year we closed five transactions, totaling more than $100 million of spend. Now let's take a more detail look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 5% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 17.7%, and core operating margin was up 185 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 100 basis points or better of core margin improvement. And for the first time, our Life Sciences segment EBITDA margin exceeded 25%. At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue increased at a high-single-digit rate on broad-based strength across all major product lines and regions. Growth in automation was driven by continued demand for the Biomek i-Series Workstations. The new sample preparation platform, the Beckman launched earlier this year. And in Flow Cytometry, the team's continuous innovation around the CytoFLEX platform contributed to further share gains during the quarter. We've expanded CytoFLEX capabilities with the recent launch of two new UV laser offerings, providing higher level analytical sensitivity on the same platform. This differentiated technology is driving sales in new research market by enabling science is to study a wider variety of advanced cell functions and viability, using our system to learn more about diseases and the effectiveness of new treatment options. Leica Microsystems delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by strength in North America and Western Europe, primarily in the applied and medical end markets. Earlier this month, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for their development of cryo-electron microscopy of visualization technology that enables researchers to observe molecular processes that have never been seen before. This achievement is particularly meaningful to Leica as the prizewinners used to our solutions to conduct their work. This is the third time in the past five years that Leica technology has been cited in Nobel Prize winning work, further evidence of the vital role that Leica plays in such critical and revolutionary scientific research. Core revenue with SCIEX was up mid-single-digit with good growth in Western Europe and China. Food and forensic testing led the way in the applied market and we saw sustained momentum in pharmaceutical testing driven in part by heightened regulatory requirements in China. At PALL, core growth declined primarily due to the negative impact of the recent hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico. Our thoughts with our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities have been impacted by these events, and we continue to prioritize their safety and wellbeing. We take a look at PALL's performance despite the hurricane impact, our microelectronics and single-use businesses continued to be strong through the quarter, while we saw slower demand across our medical and lab, food and beverage product lines. As we look ahead, we're encouraged by mid-single-digit order growth over the last six months, including double-digit order growth in our biopharma business this quarter, and we expect PALL's core revenue growth rate to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter. Operationally, PALL continues to execute very well, and the team has delivered more than 600 basis points of operating profit margin expansion since we closed the acquisition two years ago. We've reinvested a portion of these savings for growth and use DBS tools like speed design review and strategic product planning to focus our innovation efforts on high impact opportunities. These initiatives have resulted in a 50% increase in annual new product introduction since acquisition, and we are getting these new solutions out into the market faster. Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue increased 19.5% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating margin increased 80 basis points to 16.8%, and core operating margin was up 245 basis points, driven by the team's solid execution across the platform. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate. We saw solid growth in North America and in the high growth markets. Strength in China and the Middle East offset declines in Latin America. Our immunoassay product line performed very well with continued installed base growth and strong demand for our vitamin D assay. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single-digits with broad demand across developed and high growth markets. The team's execution continues to drive share gains globally in both our blood gas and AQT product lines. Leica Biosystems achieved mid-single-digit core growth, led by strength in Western Europe and China. Growth across all major product lines was led by advanced staining and core histology. We also recently launched the new PELORIS 3 tissue processing system. PELORIS 3 provides our lab customers with high quality traceable results in a shorter turnaround time. An integrated barcode scanner eliminates the need for manual records and reduces specimen handling, helping us address our customers' workflow challenges and improve their lab processes. We're approaching the one-year mark since we closed the acquisition of Cepheid and we continue to be encouraged by the team's performance. Cepheid delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, sustaining the sizeable operating profit improvements achieved over the past year. Earlier this month, Cepheid received FDA clearance for the Xpert, Xpress Group A Strep test, which provides reliable results in as little as 18 minutes. The speed and accuracy of this test allows patients and healthcare providers to access a definitive diagnosis right at the point of care and eliminates the need for lengthy bacterial cultures to confirm the result. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue was up 2.5% and core revenue increased 1%, as growth in our equipment and specialty consumables businesses was mostly offset by continued weakness in traditional consumables. Reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points and core operating margin was down 15 basis points. By product line, performance across our equipment and traditional consumables businesses remain consistent with what we've seen so far this year. Core revenue growth in equipment was up low single digits, while traditional consumables declined meaningfully, driven by continued inventory adjustments in the distribution channel. While we expect this inventory impact to moderate, the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacturer relationships may have a negative impact on equipment revenues in the near term. Turning to the other half of our Dental portfolio, we were particularly pleased with our specialty consumables businesses, achieving mid-single-digit core growth across our orthodontic and implant offerings. At Nobel Biocare, core revenue growth improved to mid-single-digits. Since acquiring Nobel nearly three years ago, we made targeted growth investments to bolster our innovation capabilities and commercial execution. We've invested in a double-digit increase in our feet on the street in North America and achieved strong growth in the region during the quarter as we began to gain traction from this go-to-market initiative. We have also increased our R&D spend meaningfully and launched more than 20 new products since acquisition, delivering breakthrough technologies like our Trefoil system, a revolutionary new treatment option that significantly reduces the time required to restore the lower jaw, now making it possible to place the full restoration on the day of surgery. By providing customers with superior products on a faster launch timeline, we've enhanced Nobel's competitive position since acquisition and are delivering sustainable core growth improvements. So moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 8% and core revenue was up 3%, reported operating profit margin decreased 190 basis points and core operating margin was down 105 basis points. These margin declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions and incremental growth investments. In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate led by strong demand for marking and coding equipment, and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offering improved sequentially and with led primarily by increased demand in China and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased mid-single-digits in the quarter with broad-based growth across most major product lines and geographies. Last month at Pack Expo, North America's largest packaging event, Videojet showcased six new printers and technologies including the new 6330 and 6530 Thermal Transfer Overprinters. These medium at high speed printers now feature an industry first in line print quality assurance system. The patented sensors on the inside of the printer recognized common code defects to help customers improve quality, productivity and efficiency on the packaging lines. By identifying customers workflow needs and delivering advanced technological solutions to fill those gaps. The team continues to meaningfully improved customers experiences and enhanced Videojet leadership position in the market. At Esko, core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by strength in our brand owner software and digital hardware businesses. And at X-Rite, core revenue was up low-single-digits, with strength in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in North America. Finally, turning to Water Quality, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate with good demand in China and Western Europe, while the high growth market saw weakness primarily in Latin America. Hach's core revenue was up low-single-digit with solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets in North America and Western Europe, and continued growth in China. At WEFTEC, the wastewater trade show in Chicago last month, Hach launched the Claros Water Intelligence System, a platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers with valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. At Hach and many of our other businesses at Danaher, we have an extensive installed base of instruments that generate a tremendous amount of data every day. Claros is a great example, how we are harnessing this information to create actionable insights for our customers, so that they can make the right decisions and be more efficient. Core revenue at Trojan declined during the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects. We are however very encouraged by healthy order trends at Trojan. Those continued to build on an increasing customer win rate. We believe this will position Trojan well to deliver better core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate during the quarter, and strength in the oil and gas, and food end markets. So to wrap-up, this is a terrific quarter performance from core revenue growth to margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by a number of strong growth drivers across the businesses. And we'll benefit from recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex becoming part of our core revenue. One of our five core values at Danaher is we compete for shareholders, and we believe that the power of the Danaher business system combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our strong balance sheet positions us to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders going forward. We are initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.16, and expect core revenue growth to accelerate from current levels. We are raising our full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.96 to $4.
Matthew Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Tracey, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.
Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Hey, good morning.
Thomas Joyce: Good morning, Tycho.
Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Good quarter. I want to start off with bioprocess. I'd say there is fair amount of noise in this channel right now, just from our discussions with investors between one of the pre-announcements we saw this week, and then Roche getting hit a bit today on the biosimilar stuff. So you had double-digit biopharma order growth there, which was great to see. Can you maybe just talk through the various pieces here in your outlook? I guess, Pall was up in North America, but then you commented on the hurricane impact, and then Asia was down, so I'm just wondering on some of that discrepancy as well.
Thomas Joyce: Sure, thanks, Tycho. We continue to be very positive on the bioprocess market overall. And I think the dynamics in the quarter was such that, we obviously saw the related softness on the shipment side that was associated with the hurricane impact. And those impacts were significant. But I think the order growth that we mentioned and you heard us talk about gives us great encouragement that we're going to see a meaningful acceleration in the top-line associated with biopharma in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about the overall dynamics. The hurricane impact was significant. We were shut down for two weeks in Puerto Rico. We were also shut down partially for two weeks in Florida, associated with our Beckman Life Sciences facility. And so, while the recovery has been a challenging one, we expect to get some of that production recovered in the fourth quarter, probably not all of it. Some of it will extend probably into the first quarter. But we're very confident in the positive underlying growth drivers in the bioprocessing market.
Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: And have you seen any of the destocking that one of your peers mentioned this week with their pre-announcement on the customer side?
Thomas Joyce: Tycho, we have seen some of that, absolutely. And we come to understand those dynamics literally on a customer-by-customer basis. And we're working through those individual customer situations. I think we have a sense of where each of them are. And we worked through like I think a good deal of that in the last quarter or two. It wouldn't be unusual, I think to see a little bit of that carry through into - through the fourth quarter, particularly given that some of those customers have facilities in Puerto Rico by the way. And so, that will take a little bit more time to work its way out, but we do think that's certainly a temporary phenomenon.
Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then for the follow-up I want to ask on Dental, it's great to see Nobel bounce back here. As we think about kind of the anniversarying these destocking headwinds, can you maybe just give us a sense as to how you are thinking about that business return to growth and any color you can provide on outlook for traditional versus specialty consumables going…?
Thomas Joyce: Sure. Well, clearly, I think as we all know, 2017 has been a challenging year for the dental industry broadly defined, but we're actually encouraged by a number of things that we're seeing. Very encouraged by the performance in our specialty consumables business, Nobel and Ormco represent nearly half of our Dental segment. We saw mid single digit growth in the third quarter and it's possible that some of that specialty business growth in those markets are taking a little share of wallet if you will from traditional consumables. And clearly, we've seen some of the sell-out impacting sell-in, and the resulting inventory destocking. However, I would say we have a sense that there is a stabilization going on there relative to traditional consumables. There is probably - there is certainly still work to do, to realign the inventories on the equipment side, relative to some of the manufacturing distributor alignment, realignments that have gone on. So I think there is a number of things that we're very positive about and a couple of dynamics that we think we'll still need to work through. But I think in summary, if we step back from our relative performance in a challenging market, we feel really good about the execution side of what we've done. The team has done a number of things associated with our operational improvements that I think repositioned us very effectively for reinvesting in innovation and go to market that will help us in 2018.
Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: And we'll go next to Scott Davis with ‎Melius Research.
Scott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.
Thomas Joyce: Well, welcome back.
Scott Davis: Thanks. I'm excited to be back. And, Tom, only you could talk about PELORIS 3 and get excited about a tissue product. And maybe offline you can explain to me what a tissue product actually is, but…
Thomas Joyce: Glad to, Scott. But in all seriousness, we're glad to have you back, good morning.
Scott Davis: Thanks. And good morning to you guys, but thank you. I'll focus in just - because I don't know how many of us industrial guys are left here, but on the industrial businesses, the - it seem like you're increasingly more excited about what you are seeing at Pall. And I assume you're more cyclical businesses like Pall Industrial, Product ID, Videojet, et cetera are setting up for a reasonably accelerating growth. Is this something your - I mean, we're seeing the macro data, but is that something you're seeing in your order books so it's leading some of your enthusiasm there?
Thomas Joyce: I think there is a bit of tailwind there, Scott, in the industrial markets. But I think if you talk about businesses for example, like Videojet that mentioned, that's really more a story of outstanding execution. And it's a combination in execution between terrific new product execution, investments in go-to-market and a tremendous service footprint that creates a real competitive advantage for a business like Videojet. An area where we have seen a really strong market dynamic would perhaps be coming back to your question about Pall and the industrial side of Pall would be in microelectronics, where we see continued growth in that segment of the business, wonderful underlying dynamics, but certainly in Asia, associated with an accelerating amount of chip production associated with the sensors that are now increasingly going into whether it's the telecommunications arena, certainly the iPhone, increasing number of sensors in cars. All of those things are contributing to a pretty strong market in microelectronics. So that will be an example of something that - where there is a market tailwind. But, I think to a great extent, we're more relying on our underlying execution in our industrial businesses than we really are on the market dynamics themselves.
Scott Davis: Okay, fair enough. And maybe you mentioned, I just didn't hear it, but what was the cause of margins going down in Environmental? Was it the Trojan revenue decline or is there some sort of mix issue in the quarter?
Thomas Joyce: We clearly had some investments in a number of businesses around Water Quality, and a little bit of the top line softness in ChemTreat, had a little bit of impact there. ChemTreat is by the way was another one of our businesses that was impacted modestly by the hurricane. In the case of ChemTreat, it was actually impacted in Houston where we have a blending facility that had some disruption. And so, just a little bit of the mix on the top-line I think and some investments that we made in those businesses was the source of that impact. But we feel very good about how Water Quality will perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see some improvements there in the fourth quarter and we'll see some reasonable margin improvement as well.
Scott Davis: Perfect. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. Best of luck and keep up the good work.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Scott.
Daniel Comas: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: And we'll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin: Hi, good morning.
Thomas Joyce: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hey, back on bioprocess and I'm going to go over the Diagnostics for the follow-up. But on the bioprocess, can you just put a little bit more color on the orders? Are you looking at more traditional biologic manufacturers, biosimilars, or are you actually still - is it orders from some of the small-molecule people because you do sell there? And I guess, is it just - could you also parse out sort of like demand on single-use systems versus kind of traditional consumables. I'm just trying to give a little bit more color on where the demand is.
Thomas Joyce: Sure. And I don't have a precise breakdown, Derik. Let me start with that caveat around the order rates from small molecule customers versus large molecule customers or even by facility on that basis. But in general, what we've seen over this year has been a reasonably balanced order book across those two segments of the bioprocessing market. Relative to your question about single-use, single-use continues to be a double-digit growth business for us, both in terms of the order book as well as what we saw actually in the top line in the third quarter. So we feel terrific about how that business is continuing to trend for us.
Daniel Comas: I think part of the encouragement in the third quarter order book in the improvement as Tom noted, single-use has been strong throughout the year, including the third quarter just like some of the hurricane issues from a shipment point of view, but the order recover was more broad-based.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thank you. And on Diagnostics, I know it's probably too early to get a read, but are you seeing any signs at all from hospital labs on what they're purchasing patterns may look like? Order patterns may look like, as they sort of gear up for the PAMA pricing world they're facing next year?
Thomas Joyce: It is too early, certainly. For those on the call it may not be quite as tuned into this reference that Derik made to PAMA. Essentially there is a dynamic going on in the market associated with reimbursement rates associated with test that are done or reimbursed on what's called the clinical lab fee schedule. Derik, it's still early days as you know even that ruling or that those recommendations associated with PAMA are in a comment period now. The industry have raised issues associated with narrow dataset that was used to compared private payer rates with the actual Medicare reimbursement rates. And so, I think, we got a little bit of time here, first of all just to wait to see how does that fee schedule ultimately gets set post the comment period. And then, I think, it's natural to assume that for the small portion of our business that is in - essentially in the outpatient environment and reimbursed through that fee schedule that there would be some pricing pressure. But pricing pressure is a natural dynamic as you know in that market and so we'll just have to wait a bit of time and we can come back to you with a little bit more of an update as things settle out.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thanks very much.
Daniel Comas: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.
Doug Schenkel: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.
Thomas Joyce: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Schenkel: I guess, I want to stay on the topic of Diagnostics. You have the highest core growth rate in at least six quarters, I believe. I'm just wondering, if you would talk a little bit more about the key drivers to this improvement and specifically how much of this was from the ongoing Beckman stabilization and growth initiatives. How should we think about sustainability, especially as we are modeling out Q4 2018 and beyond?
Thomas Joyce: Sure. We did have a good quarter without question in Diagnostics. We saw a really good execution certainly led by Radiometer, which delivered high-single-digit growth in the period Leica Biosystems and anatomical pathology, mid-single-digit grower, and we saw improvement in Beckman Diagnostics as well. So we feel good about that, I think we can sustain a growth rate there that certainly probably north of 3%. But Beckman does face the toughest comp that they will face this year against last year's fourth quarter. So we could see a little moderation there against that comp in the fourth quarter. But we do get Cepheid into the core, only for half the quarter, if we got it in for the full fourth quarter, we'd probably be pushing up to - probably in the 4% neighborhood for the full quarter. So we feel good about the progress we are making, Beckman is absolutely still on a journey of improvement across the number of different fronts, but we are really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out. We're encouraged by some of the talent infusion that we've made in that business, and certainly a great start at Cepheid and the sustained growth rates in operating margin improvements there have allowed us to continue to reinvest across the platform in R&D, and sales and marketing. Put that together with some new product innovations and we think we are setting ourselves up for some continued improvement in 2018.
Doug Schenkel: Thank you for that. And that's a good segue to my next question on Cepheid. It looks like Cepheid grew 15% year-over-year, and I was looking back at our standalone Cepheid model, and the comp was actually pretty tough, I think they grew 25% year-over-year in the last year quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on with Cepheid? How much of this is a function of DBS efforts? Essentially, what inning are you in there? And well, why don't I just pause there, because I think that's the crux of the question.
Thomas Joyce: Sure, sure. A terrific quarter without question, at Cepheid. Double-digit core growth, pretty balanced driven across both developed markets and the high growth markets, and most major product lines. Infectious disease, sexual health, both double-digit. Hospital acquired infections is a softer market of course, but we feel good about how we're positioned there. And so I think both geographically and from a product line perspective, we couldn't be more pleased with what's happening at Cepheid. And the investment that continues to on at Cepheid associated with innovation and new products, I think, bodes well for the future. We also continue to invest in their geographic footprint. We're building a team in China right now, it's still early days, but that team is growing nicely, and we expect to see some continued good growth in the high growth markets over time. And then relative to the impact of DBS, I mean, DBS is having an impact at Cepheid, initially around the operating margin improvements, which you saw jump up pretty significantly just in the first six months after we acquired, and we've sustained those and continue to increment those in the six months that follow. And that's really been around a number of initiatives that start with the low-hanging fruit and works then to some of the more challenging things around procurement in the supply chain both direct and indirect costs in a number of different opportunities that we've identified. In addition, DBS is having an impact on continuing to sustain the double-digit growth rate. We've implemented DBS tools associated with new product introductions to become more efficient and more timely in those new product introductions and introduce products with the highest possible quality right at launch. So I think, there's a number of different areas, and if I step back for a second, I'd say one of the most encouraging thing is how readily the tools of the Danaher Business System have been adopted by that team. It's been just terrific to see they have chosen those tools that make the biggest impact on the business, and it put them to work I think in the areas that made the most sense in terms of overall performance. So good to go, we look forward to another good year next year.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thanks for all that detail. And congrats on a good quarter and all the progress.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Joyce: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Beuchaw: Thanks and good morning, hey, guys. I'll throw two. They're a little bit more financially oriented, here real quick. One maybe more of a Dan question, one maybe more of a Tom question. Dan, I wonder, now that we have clarity post Veris on some of the cost savings, how you are thinking about those cost savings is contributive to the margin profile for the Diagnostics business next year. Does that drop through? Do we split that between incremental reinvest by - reinvestment on the commercial side. How should we think about the Veris savings as accretive to margins? And then, for Tom…
Thomas Joyce: Okay. Go ahead, Steve.
Steve Beuchaw: Sorry. For Tom, on the last call you introduced or perhaps reintroduced some parameters in terms of how you think about what makes an attractive acquisition target. I wonder, if you could just give us a sense for as you - maybe a little bit more active, given where we are relative to the balance sheet and thinking about what the right thing is to do with that capital? How do you think the environment has evolved in terms of the potential returns on capital, and how those might be different between smaller versus larger assets? Thanks so much.
Daniel Comas: Steve, I'll kick off, yeah. We're tracking pretty well as we go into next year with an expectation of about $40 million of costs coming out of the Beckman P&L, because of what we've done here with Veris. We are taking a portion of it, probably close to half of that number, and investing that in Cepheid. As you know, we're going to - they're going to take over kind of broader molecular effort here, and we think that investment will help them accelerate some of their activities.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Dan. Steve, associated with your question on M&A. First in terms of the environment, I'd say we've seen some modest improvement in activity around deal opportunities. So that gives us some encouragement that there's opportunities perhaps breaking free, but we'll see always hard to predict. Relative to our viewpoint on acquisitions, we have always valued the balance between small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions that are really accretive both strategically and financially to our platforms. Balanced with larger acquisitions that sometimes add a new leg or an adjacency to a platform or occasionally in our history that have added a new platform. As I've said in the past, our focus really is on the five platforms we have today and looking at adjacencies that might materially improve those platforms as they exist. From a priority standpoint, we always prioritize markets first, and we look for attractive global markets with good growth dynamics. And then we look at companies secondarily, and we look for companies with good growth dynamics and margin opportunities. We certainly value the consumables and the aftermarket side of companies. You've seen us build the portfolio now into the 60 - 65% of the portfolio is in consumables, and that obviously is a key source of underlying growth and stability, a lack of cyclicality and inherently good gross margins. And so we remain very consistent, I think, in those views of what markets and companies are attractive. And then finally, we look at valuation. And we've always valued a disciplined approach to returns. We've consistently said that small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions, we look for those double-digit returns to be in - roughly a three year timeframe. And then if we're talking about a larger acquisition or an adjacency those double-digit returns still remain vitally important, but the timeframe associated with those maybe a bit longer. Historically, we've targeted inside of a five-year timeframe. Occasionally, those get a hair longer than that, when the strategic value and the long-term opportunity really warrants it. So I would say, our views in terms of the characteristics we look for and the approach, we've taken remain very consistent with our history.
Steve Beuchaw: Thanks, Tom. Really appreciate the refresher there.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker: Thanks. Good morning all.
Daniel Comas: Hey, hey, look who is back. Welcome.
Steven Winoker: Yeah, Scott and I'll take those every time we can.
Thomas Joyce: Hey, Steve. How are you doing?
Steven Winoker: Good. How are you?
Thomas Joyce: I'm good. Thanks. Thanks for joining.
Steven Winoker: Pleasure. Thanks for having me. So listen, just moving back to a couple of topics you already hit on, but I like to go a little further. I remember, when you guys first purchased Beckman. We were really talking about mid-single-digit growth over a long timeframe. So you've seen mid-to-high, and you've seen obviously improvement, right, from flat to low. I'm sure Florida took a little bit of a chunk out. But if you had to kind of point to - has your expectation there changed, shifted? Is there something fundamental? Or it's just all been just a temporary issue that you're kind of working through, and you really believe the growth is there?
Thomas Joyce: Steve, your recollection is a good one. And we do - did and do have a view that Beckman Coulter, the acquisition that we did those years ago, has the potential to become a mid-single-digit growth business, and we would obviously see to drive that beyond that but particularly as we broaden the exposure to certain end markets, like the molecular market, which Beckman obviously did not have exposure to in the past, and where Cepheid now plays such an important role. And it has been a journey, one thing I would maybe remind everybody is that the Beckman Coulter that we acquired was then initially split into two different businesses. And our Diagnostics business became a separate business from our Life Science business. Beckman Coulter Life Science, we often described in those days as an $800 million start-up that we had to kind of take from a flat to declining business and drive to growth. We've done that very successfully Beckman Coulter Life Science has become an innovator in its market and has now driven consistent mid-single-digit growth and great operating margin improvements. And so, we're really pleased with that. On the Dx side, it's been a longer journey. There was a pretty significant inheritance tax that we had to pay, and have continued to have to pay associated with lack of innovation, some quality and regulatory related matters, and frankly, long sales cycles, and frankly, long customer memories. And those have been a challenge for us. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made, taking that flat Dx business, probably actually - probably on its way to declining slightly, and improving it, and improving the operating margins and driving working capital improvements, improving retention rates and win rates. But it's been a long journey and there is still a journey to go. And so, we still believe that the opportunities there are significant and we'll see continuous improvement. But it's been slow going, but we're confident in the improvement potential ahead.
Daniel Comas: And, Steve, to add to the point, if you put the two Beck together, for example, in the third quarter, they were combined mid single digit growers with a lot of margin expansion.
Steven Winoker: Okay. That's helpful. Second on Environmental and Applied Solutions, you talked about it a little bit. But I would have thought in the constructive environment that is out there today and given some of the secular tailwinds behind some of the newer parts of that business, that's relatively newer, that you would have seen better than 3% growth core. So again, maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in terms of the ability to accelerate that even a little. And also, kind of adjacencies as you sort of look at that business and think about kind of adjacent paths that might also supplement forward organic growth after the acquisition's anniversary.
Thomas Joyce: Sure, thanks, Steve. So, important to separate EAS into Product Id and Water Quality, so Product ID remained very solid, mid-single-digit growth in the period, continued outstanding performance from Videojet and good performance from both Esko and X-Rite. I'll come to those relative to your adjacency question in just a minute. But on the Water Quality side, in the third quarter we were little lighter on the core growth side, a low-single-digit growth. Hach showed improvement in - relative to the second quarter and - but we still saw some softness in the environmental business. But again, we firmly believe and we understand that that's more project timing. The muni and industrial side of Hach continues to perform very well. The other dynamic in the quarter, relative to Water Quality was, again, really around project timing at Trojan. Trojan has seen terrific growth - order growth rates this year and good top line performance. In the quarter, we just simply saw some project delays and - but we saw double-digit orders and we think there is actually pretty good potential that Trojan might show double-digit core growth in the fourth quarter. And again, a little bit of a shortfall at ChemTreat related to the Hurricane impact, but ChemTreat has been a very consistent performer. So I think to step back from all that at the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment and we would say we feel very good about the performance there. The underlying order rates are good and we'll see improved performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to your question about adjacencies, I think those two platforms underneath that segment are actually great examples of how we have extended a platform through acquisitions into adjacencies and broadened the number of solutions we bring to customers. If you think about how we broadened Water Quality originally with the extension into treatment at Trojan and into ChemTreat, and ChemTreat how it was accretive to our growth rate, I think great examples. I think Product ID as we extended Videojet back into packaging workflow, all the way back to the brand owner designing that packaging with Esko and X-Rite and Pantone. I mean, those are just textbook examples of how we think about expanding the platform and improving growth rates and the - and our strategic heft if you will. And so, those are good models. We would attempt to continue to extend those models. Again, it's all a question of cultivating the right targets and eventually breaking them free. But we have active pipelines in each one of the businesses that, each one of the platforms to do just that.
Steven Winoker: Great, very helpful, guys, I look forward to working together going forward. Bye.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
Thomas Joyce: Hey, Jeff, good morning.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ons, one back to water. Tom, your confidence on that Q4 timing, I asked that kind of in the spirit that we are hearing about some delays in other pockets in muni work. I'm wondering if these projects that didn't start in Q3 have already started in Q4, I mean, it sounds like the orders and backlog are there. But I guess just to address the risk of potential further push-out. And then secondly, just as we think about your comments back on Dental or maybe equipment now stepping down, I would assume that's going to create some absorption issues in the plants and maybe some other ripple effects, just what are the ramifications for Dental margins in Q4 when you look that swirl of kind of specialized consumables little better and maybe equipment taking a step down?
Thomas Joyce: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. So relative to water in the fourth quarter, we do feel good about water in the fourth quarter associated with the order rates that we mentioned. Your question specifically about project delays, I mean, to some extent there is - that's always a dynamic that can exist in the muni market, but when we're in as close as we are right now, usually we have a pretty good sense, for example, at Trojan in terms of what's going to ship when relative to construction schedules and those kinds of things. Some of what has gone on in our, what we call, our environmental business, which is more associated with government funding and releasing tenders associated with more natural resources like rivers, lakes and streams and monitoring of deep ocean, that's where I think it can be a little bit more uncertain. So balancing all that, I think we have pretty good line of sight to the fourth quarter. Sure, there can always be one thing or another that gets pushed out. But in general or on balance across ChemTreat, Trojan, Hach and the broader portfolio, again, we feel pretty good about where we are. Relative to your question about Dental equipment, this is an uncertain environment in terms of some of the manufacturer/distributor realignment that I mentioned, and the potential impact on equipment. So, I mean, I think we dialed in our outlook reasonably conservatively and we manage the cost structures in the factor associated with the volumes that we see coming, so…
Daniel Comas: And, Jeff, maybe to add to that, so the equipment side, we will have a couple of tough quarters here, because of what is likely to be a destock in the equipment side. And that will hurt the equipment margin. I still think we get an offset, because we've gone through this destock period on the traditional consumables and we feel like we're kind of getting towards the end of that. And if anything, consumables are more profitable than equipment. So as Tom said, I think it will probably align, equipments going to get tougher on the margin side, but consumable - traditional consumables will start to see some recovery here in Q4.
Jeff Sprague: Okay, great. Thank you.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Arias with Citi.
Thomas Joyce: Good morning, Dan.
Daniel Arias: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just on Diagnostics on the topic of the selling environment, if I think back to the beginning of the last year, it kind of sounded like you weren't really sure whether ACA and everything associated with that were material factors. So I guess, as we push through the year, I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Do you feel like health reform issues are affecting demand, or is it more of the - it is sort of the fringe element that's not really impactful on results?
Thomas Joyce: Dan, it is hard to pin down. There is no doubt that the backing and forthing in Washington associated with ACA creates uncertainty in the minds of our customers and uncertainty is never good as we all know. And it creates a little bit of hesitancy, not in all customers, but in some customers, but it's hard to pin down the materiality of that. I mean, there are a couple of things, there is one in particular that is a little bit easier to pin down and that's med device tax. If ACA is repealed as it's been proposed a number of times, the med device tax typically would - it has been - would go out the window permanently. It's been in suspense so far all this year. That had a really very, very modest impact on us, both when it came into being, then when it went into suspense. So, I mean, but that's a more practical and specific example, but again, the materiality of the uncertainty, very hard to pin.
Daniel Arias: Okay, helpful. And maybe just to finish off that last point, with Dental forecast, unless I missed it, do the puts and takes there net out at Dental, core growth staying up modestly to finish the year or is that not necessarily something we should count on? Thanks.
Daniel Comas: I think the planning assumption we had going into the second half of being Dental relatively flat, granted we were up kind of 1% here in the third quarter, is a good planning assumption for the fourth quarter. But as we talked about more broadly, we expect accelerating core growth in the fourth quarter. We talked about Pall, we talked about the inclusion of Cepheid. We expect water to get better. So for us the 3% we posted here in the third quarter, we think we'd be looking more to 3.5% to 4% range from core growth in Q4.
Daniel Arias: Okay, thanks.
Thomas Joyce: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks.
Matthew Gugino: Thanks, Tracey. And thanks everyone for joining. We're around all day for questions.

Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, solid core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. Pall and Cepheid are two most recent largest acquisitions, also continued to perform very well. Looking ahead, we expect our core growth rate in the second half of 2017 to accelerate compared to first half levels, driven by improving order trends and as recent acquisition by Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. And with our continued strong free cash flow generation and strengthening balance sheet, we feel well positioned to actively pursue larger acquisition opportunities going forward. With that as a backdrop, let's move to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.99, which represents an increase of 10% over the last year. Sales increased 6.5% to $4.5 billion, and core revenue grew 2%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up low single digits, with solid results in the U.S. and Japan slightly offset by performance in Western Europe. High-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by China, which delivered high single-digit growth or better in each of our four segments. Reported operating profit margins declined 150 basis points to 15.2%, primarily due to the impact of charges related to the discontinuation of a product line in our Diagnostics segment and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. Our core operating margin increased 70 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences, Environmental and Applied Solutions, and Dental segments. Strong free cash flow enables us to pursue high-impact growth opportunities across our portfolio, and it continues to be one of our most important metrics at Danahar. We generated $892 million of free cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 160%. We now anticipate full year 2017 free cash flow to grow double digit over 2016.  On the M&A front, we closed three bolt-on acquisitions during the quarter, totaling approximately $100 million of spend in our product ID, product quality and life sciences platforms. Now let’s take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio.  In Life Sciences, reported revenues increased 4% and core revenue grew 3.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 150 basis points to 16%, and core operating margin was up 120 basis points. This continued margin expansion was driven by the team’s consistent execution across the life science platform. Beckman Life Sciences delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance across all major product lines, most notably, transportation and automation. Beckman’s recently launched Biomek i-Series Automated Workstations are gaining traction in the market, and several key automation projects contributed to strong results in North America. We saw a broad-based growth geographically, and we’re well positioned in China to benefit from the region’s continued investment in biopharma and life science research.  One of Danahar’s core values is, “innovation defines our future”, and since we acquired Beckman Life Sciences in 2011, this has been a key area of focus for the team. They have increased new product launches meaningfully with more than 10 new product introductions in each of the last two years, and this cadence of innovation has been a key driver of Beckman Life Sciences’ enhanced growth trajectory. What was a flat core growth business at the time of acquisition is now a mid-single-digit performer that has continued to gain share in its markets.  Leica Microsystems core revenue was up low single digits with good performance across high-growth markets, partially offset by weakness in developed markets. At SCIEX, core revenue increased in a mid-single-digit rate, led by strength in the pharmaceutical and food testing end markets, while academic demand was stable across most major geographies.  At the ASMS Annual Conference in June, SCIEX highlighted the market’s first FDA-cleared vitamin D assay for in vitro diagnostic use exclusively on our clinical mass spec platform the Topaz System. Topaz and its accompanying clear core software are easy to learn and validate and have been specifically designed for the clinical lab. This new solution with the SCIEX vitamin D assay will enable clinical labs to expand their in-house testing services and run more tests more efficiently while delivering more confident results to support physicians with their critical treatment decisions.  Pall reported low single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance in both our life sciences and industrial businesses, partly impacted by a tough prior year comparison. At Pall Life Sciences, growth was driven by biopharma, particularly double-digit growth in single-use technologies. At Pall Industrial, modest growth was driven by microelectronics and aerospace. Declines in process and industrial was due to a large Middle East project in the first half of last year that did not repeat. But we are encouraged by healthy order growth across this business and expect improved performance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 14.5%, and core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating margin declined 760 basis points to 10.9%, and core operating margin was down 25 basis points. These margin declines are largely due to the restructuring charges associated with our decision to discontinue to Beckman VERIS molecular diagnostics product line and the acquisition impact of the Cepheid transaction. Absent the impact of the restructuring charges, Diagnostics’ reported operating margin was up more than 400 basis points from the first quarter. Last month, we announced to our customers the decision to redirect our team’s molecular diagnostic efforts from the Beckman VERIS platform over to Cepheid. We are committed to providing the best solutions for our customers, and we believe that Cepheid molecular systems provide a better longer-term foundation for these efforts. Cepheid’s platform offers industry-leading throughput and the most comprehensive molecular test menu on a single system. We believe that focusing investment on this technology, combined with Beckman’s strong global market presence, will accelerate our ability to provide more comprehensive molecular solutions to benefit our customers. As a result, we incurred total charges of approximately $76 million, of which $49 million were non-cash related to the impairment of certain intangible and other related assets and $27 million in cash charges. We expect these cash charges to result in a benefit of approximately $40 million in annual savings in 2018. Turning to Cepheid second quarter results. Double-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and product lines. The team is consistently incorporating DBS tools into the day-to-day processes, and their efforts have sustained the double-digit operating profit margins achieved in the first quarter. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter increased at a low single-digit rate with growth in China and North America partially offset by declines in Western Europe and Japan. Byproduct line, our chemistry and immunoassay businesses continued to lead the way. Radiometer’s core revenue grew low single digits, led by another quarter of growth across our blood gas and AQT product lines. In May, Radiometer launched the crea and urea parameters on the ABL90. These are two new blood tests that identify potentially life-threatening problems with kidney function. Radiometer now offers 19 critical care parameters, the broadest range available on a compact platform that delivers crucial results in just 35 seconds. As the most comprehensive blood gas testing provider in the world, Radiometer’s innovations are helping caregivers make critical diagnostic decisions that save lives every day. At Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits with growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Leica’s performance was led by another strong quarter in our advanced staining business, and we saw solid results across our core histology product line as well.  Turning to our Dental segment. Reported revenue was down 1.5% and core revenue was down 1%. Supported operating profit margin increased 30 basis points and core operating margin was up 50 basis points, due primarily to the benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives. During the quarter, we saw positive growth in our equipment and specialty consumable product lines, including implants and orthodontics. This was more than offset by a decline in our traditional consumables businesses, which was due primarily to continued inventory destocking by several of our distribution partner, primarily in North America and Western Europe. We believe these channel dynamics will continue and expect our Dental core growth rates in the second half of the year to be consistent with the results we’ve seen so far in the first half. Recognizing the near-term challenges, we remain focused on building greater long-term value across our dental platform. The team’s recent operational improvements have supported reinvestment in growth initiatives to increase the cadence of product innovation, improve quality and enhance commercial execution.  Over the last two years, we have improved our operating profit margin by more than a 100 basis points and seeing consistent growth rates in several of our key product categories. We continue to focus on positioning our dental business for sustainable long-term growth and value creation.  Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 4.5% and core revenue was up 3%. Reported operating profit margins increased 70 basis points, while core operating margin was up 120 basis points.  In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate. We saw continued healthy demand for our marking and coding equipment and consumables in most major geographies, led by North America. Demand for our packaging and color solutions was driven by strength in high-growth market. Videojet’s core revenue growth was up mid-single digits, and the team continued to build upon their track record of outperformance. We saw balanced growth across North America, Western Europe and Asia.  Videojet grew across all major product lines and launched three new products in May, including the Videojet 1860 printer, our new industrial inkjet platform. The 1860’s key differentiator is the combination of onboard-predictive analytics and remote connectivity. The advanced maintenance analytics can alert operators well before common downtime issues arise, and the remote service capability enables operators to recover quickly from production line interruptions without an onsite service visit. The 1860 printer has been specifically designed to help our customers improve their uptime and productivity and driver lower operating costs. Customers rely on Videojet solutions to print on more than 10 billion products daily, and we now have the largest installed base of remotely connected printers worldwide. Core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, the growth driven by an acceleration in Europe and the high-growth markets. Finally, turning to water quality. Core revenue growth increased at a low single-digit rate with particular strength in our water treatment businesses. At Hach, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw a solid growth in our core municipal and industrial end markets and another good quarter of performance in China. This was partially offset by weakness in Latin America and project timing in our environmental businesses. Looking ahead, we expect that Hach will show improved core growth in the second half of the year. Trojan delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, a result that the team has now achieved in eight of the last 10 quarters. We saw healthy demand across the municipal end markets in North America and China, with robust project activity in those regions. An important factor in Trojan’s project win rate has been the ability to provide our customers with outstanding technology solutions. Trojan recently expanded the capabilities of one of its core wastewater product lines, TrojanUV Signa, to broaden its applications, and it can now be used at nearly any size wastewater facility and for water reuse. This advancement enhances Trojan’s competitive advantage and has been a key driver of recent demand. ChemTreat continued to outperform with high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by positive momentum in North and Latin America. We saw particular strength across the food, fuel, and oil and gas end markets, and the team’s consistent execution contributed to additional share gains across the businesses. So to wrap up, the team executed well during the second quarter driving double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect our core growth rate to accelerate versus the first half levels of improving order trends and as recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. We belief that the power of the Danaher Business System, significant opportunity across our portfolio and strengthening balance sheet position, all come together to position us well for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.92 and $0.96 and expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.90 to $3.97.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lauren, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe just first touching on sort of the sequential growth acceleration you’re looking for, a lot of moving parts in the business. It feels like maybe in environmental and water, there was also maybe a bit of order push-out. Can you just give us some color and help us bridge back to a growth rate for Danahar that would be more consistent with what we would think about for these businesses. Again, you had a lot of comp noise and some order movements. You’ve obviously got the acquisitions as you’ve said. So help us sort of walk through the parts and then your confidence level in turning some of the pieces like dental, where the growth rates are obviously not where you wanted to be. Obviously, that doesn’t happen overnight, but that you’ve got the right sort of plan and that you understand why it’s underperformed and in turn can get back to that more normalized rate.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Good morning, Ross. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Let’s start with the jumping-off point, Ross, of sort of the second quarter end and the first half. If we look at the 2% in the quarter and really look through that to the order rate, and we’re actually rather encouraged by the core orders, which were 100 basis points better than our core growth. When we look at the second quarter number that we put up, that was mostly obviously due to dental. Our expectations were in line with dental being closer to a flat number came in lower than that, down slightly, and the results of that really represented the difference between the 2% we put up and the 2.5% that we expected. So it was really largely around the dental. I’ll come back to water in just a second and your point about timing. We are seeing the continued destocking that I mentioned, and that’s primarily around the traditional consumables side, and we look at the rest of the dental portfolio, and as I mentioned, we continue to see good performance across our specialty consumables businesses as well as equipment. And so, I think we need to get through these adjustments relative to the channel before we can see some better performance from the dental platform, and as a result of that, we thought it was a relatively prudent approach to think of that as being consistent in the second half of the year with the first half of the year until we can get through those.  I’ll come back to the forward look here in a second, but I thought there were a number of encouraging things around the jumping-off, or starting point, here in the second quarter and the first half. Life Science in particular at 3.5%, a little bit better than expectations; really good performance at Beck Life Science; and at SCIEX as well, both mid-single digit, very good quarters. And despite the lower number that we put up at Pall, and you mentioned this briefly in your question, a very challenging comp at Pall both in terms of the life science side as well as the industrial side relative to the first half of last year and specifically the second quarter. So I think there is a number of things to point to you that would suggest that there are some things that underlies the first half, which, once we get passed, would suggest better performance in the second half. So the first half, you’re really looking at a 2.5% sort of start, again, encouraged by the core orders that were about 100 basis points better than that. We get passed the comp issues at Pall. We see Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the core and some modest improvement in water quality, particularly as it relates to this timing in Hach environmental, which were some larger orders, I think that 3% number that we’re looking for in the third quarter and some better numbers than that in the fourth quarter, all feel quite reasonable to us. If I step back even further back for a second, Ross, we’ve done a portfolio here that’s demonstrated over the last couple of years, the ability to drive 3%, 3.5% core growth as a starting point. And so, I think, with some of these further factors, again, we’re relatively encouraged about the potential here. At a macro level, we think the exposures that we have to high-growth end markets, like biologics, like food and environmental, our growing position in molecular, even the opportunities that we have in the dental platform around the digitization of dentistry, all are strong macro drivers that underpin this platform. Recent acquisitions are clearly faster-growing businesses than in the underlying portfolio that they came in to, and again, improvement at more recently acquired businesses that we’ve talked about for a period of time here, the newness of this portfolio and our ability to drive core growth that we’ve demonstrated in the past with newer businesses. I think, you put all those things together, and I think there’s a lot of reasons to be optimistic for the acceleration that we’re looking for in the second half. So I know it’s a bit of a long-winded answer. Apologize for that, but hopefully that gives you a sense of things.
Ross Muken: No, that’s helpful. And just maybe as you’re thinking about – again, you made comments around the balance sheet and, obviously, the ability at this point given where you with Cepheid and other assets to potentially contemplate other M&A, can you kind of remind us, given the current environment and sort of where the business mix and how the different pieces are performing, kind of what your bias is right now in terms of the style of assets you’re looking for and maybe in all sort of size limits, et cetera?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Ross, just in terms of the balance sheet, I mean, we feel very good about it, particularly given the exceptional free cash flow that we delivered here in the quarter, nearly $900 million of free cash flow in great conversion continues to position the balance sheet exceptionally well for further acquisition efforts. We’ve talked to $500 billion worth of opportunities here in the second half, but by the time we round the corner, with this bubble of free cash flow generation, round the corner into 2018, we’d be back to spending certainly at a free cash flow level or beyond. So I think our bias from a size standpoint continues to increase as the balance sheet returns to fighting shape. Relative to our business model and our preferences, obviously, our past track record here in the last couple of years would suggest we look for businesses with strong underlying growth capabilities and growth trajectory in strong market positions, leading positions in those markets. You’ve seen us build our position relative to the consumables and aftermarket in our businesses. Today, we are at roughly 55% consumables, and we think that underpins the level of market and volumes visibility and stability and also underpins good gross margins and strong operating margins. We look for global businesses and exposure and opportunities to high-growth markets. I think Cepheid is a great example of a business that has tremendous opportunities in high-growth markets but largely under-penetrated in those markets. And so, I think a continued bias towards strong growth rate, good consumables businesses, balanced with exceptional installed bases that are anchored by strong brand, global positions and high-growth market opportunities, I think all represent the kind of model that we’d be looking for in future acquisitions. So hopefully that helps.
Ross Muken: All the color was super helpful. Thanks, Tom. 
Thomas Patrick Joyce: You bet, Ross. Thanks for the questions. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Tom, I mean, I think you called out a softness in the US clinical market both from spec and Beckman. Is that all ACA/PAMA noise? And, I guess, with Beckman still stuck in the kind of low single-digit growth, what gives you a comfort in an acceleration in the back half of the year for that?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks, Tycho. Tycho, we actually in mass spec, we had a very good quarter in mass spec with good performance, particularly in pharma and in the applied markets. The only softness that we saw around mass spec, which is not really new news, we’ve seen it earlier this year and it really is a comp versus prior year, is really around the clinical anchored store clinical position in mass spec around pain panels. And as some of the reimbursement chains in pain panels, we saw a headwind there, and we’ll get through that headwind in the balance of this year; but otherwise, good performance, a very good performance SCIEX generally across the number of the end markets.  At Beckman, in diagnostics, we were very encouraged by the continued improvement particularly in North America with improving retention rates that we track very consistently as well as competitive win rates. That being said, we do believe that there is some uncertainty in the end markets today around ACA and what ultimately happens there. We’ve seen some hesitation on the part of some customers to make some decisions, and we’re going to need to get through that. I don’t think the happenings of the past week have done much to eliminate that uncertainty; but in the meantime, I think we’re driving what we can control well, which is ensuring that we serve our current customers well and drive increasing levels of customer retention and enhancing our win rates, and that’s coming partly on the back of the work that we’ve done in terms of new products, both in terms of our hematology platform as well as assays that we’ve launched around AMH and vitamin D. So we are encouraged by the performance there. We think that the rationalization of the product portfolio between the VERIS, the VERIS platform and the Cepheid platform is going to enhance our position in what is arguably the fastest growing segment of the diagnostic market, which is molecular.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then – and geographically, the PMI indicators have actually been better out of Europe, you called out softness there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in some of the leading indicators?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Sure. Well, both in terms of leading and the lagging, Western Europe actually is – our softness there is largely around our dental platform. We had a number of businesses that performed quite well in Europe, but we would put the bulk of that softness in Western Europe around dental.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, and then just lastly on the dental. You’ve called up pricing in the 10-Q. That seems to be a bit of a new dynamic is – just maybe quantify how much of impact that had versus destocking?
Daniel L. Comas: Tycho, it’s very, very modest. We’re talking 20 basis points. And we were flat in pricing in dental. In the first quarter, we were just down ever so slightly. A little bit of that is mix. Given consumables, where we tend to get more pricing, was so weak in the second quarter, I don’t think there is any meaningful change in pricing in dental.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks. 
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks, Tycho. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hi, good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Good morning.
Derik De Bruin: Hey, a couple of questions that I’m going to focus on diagnostics. It looks like the core operating profit margin on diagnostics, it was down 25 bps when you exclude everything, and I think this was second quarter in a row. Is there just some talks – some comments on the margin trend there and what impacting it? And then the other question is, it looks like Cepheid is growing 18-ish percent on an – if I look at the numbers. That’s definitely -- last quarter and this quarter, definitely your Cepheid numbers are above what we have modeled as a standalone for the company when we – the company was still public. Could you talk a little bit about is it ensured placements, is it higher utilization on Cepheid? Just color on the revenue trends, if it’s bulk high market growth – high developing market, high-burden market? Just a little bit more color on what the Cepheid numbers are?
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. You bet, Derik. So let’s start with the Dx operating margins. The – what we put up is negative 25 basis points. If you look at the FX impact on that, which in the case of a diagnostics is probably one of the more notable impacts of FX in the quarter, net of FX diagnostics actually put a positive 50 basis points.
Derik De Bruin: Got it.
Daniel L. Comas: Operating margin. So, underlying operating margin -- and that is, if you look at the improvement from the first quarter, that’s where my comments earlier represent a 400 basis point improvement over our operating margin performance in the first quarter, so good trajectory and good underlying performance. So, we feel pretty good about what’s going on there. Turning to Cepheid. You’re right. We put up some pretty significant double-digit growth rates there at Cepheid so far through the first half of this year, and those are higher growth rates than what we’ve seen historically. Derik, that’s largely a function of some fairly large orders that we had both in the first and the second quarter, largely associated, but not exclusively, but largely associated with the high-growth markets. We continue to believe that Cepheid on a go-forward basis is a solid 10% kind of growth business. So we love the fact that we are putting up the numbers we are, and we continue to go aggressively towards large tender wins. But obviously those are a little less predictable and -- but we feel very comfortable with a sustained 10% flat double-digit growth rate going forward. Utilization remains quite good. We track utilization sort of account by account. So I think the underlying performance of the business both in terms of placements in the developed markets as well as utilization across the breath of the menu remains consistent and in some cases actually improving through some growth initiatives that the team is putting forward.
Derik De Bruin: Great. Thank you very much.
Daniel L. Comas: Thanks, Derik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Starting on guidance. For the year, what is your core revenue growth target? And what are you targeting by business? And then related to that, could you just speak to how ongoing dental weakness is impacting your growth outlook for the year as we sit here today relative to where we were, say, 90 days ago?
Daniel L. Comas: Dough, so what we are talking about is an acceleration to 3% ballpark, a 3% core growth in the third quarter and better than that here in the fourth quarter. Tom talked about the underpinnings about better order growth. We did have the unusual dynamic in the second quarter that core order growth was better than shipment growth in every one of our four reporting segments, and that’s part of the encouragement we have kind of going into Q3 and the second half year. A high-level perspective, if we look at the second half, we expect three of the four platforms, excluding Dental, to accelerate here from where we are in the second quarter. Dental we expect versus relatively flat in the first quarter, we have a pretty conservative assumption here around dental here for the balance of the year, given the comments that Tom already made.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, understood, and that’s helpful. But to be clear, you don’t want to give specific by segment or full year core growth targets and you don’t want to comment on how dental has changed relative to what you’re embedding into guidance if it has changed relative to where we were a quarter or two ago, correct?
Daniel L. Comas: I think I kind of give you numbers in the total company Q3, Q4. We tend to give directional numbers around the segment. And clearly dental, dental is a lower number here than we were thinking in April. Again, I said that some of the other businesses are performing a little -- expectations were a little better than we thought here in April on the heels of what we’ve seen in terms of order growth and -- better performance around margins is evidenced in the second quarter. 
Doug Schenkel: Okay, that’s helpful. On dental, a real basic question, and I know it’s a one that comes up probably in every meeting. So I am just looking to get educated again. How was it possible that distributors can still be destocking? It seems like this has been going on for better part of a year, and it seems like you’d expect this is to continue for the balance of the year. I guess, just practically speaking, how much longer do you think this can take? Again, I’m just trying to get educated on this dynamic and also trying to, I guess, at least get a better understanding of how confident you can be that there is not more going on than just destocking.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: I think what’s a little bit different about the scenario today versus probably nine months ago is that nine months ago, we were really talking about a phenomenon that the channel first began taking about, which is that the disconnect between what was being sold in and what was being sold out started to create an inventory issue. So as the consumables market began to slow down, distributors began to adjust their order patterns later last year. I think what’s different today that’s enhanced it, Doug, is that there are some channel dynamics going on right now with some shifts in terms of manufacturing distributor alignment, all that’s been made public, and I think that has further exacerbated some of the shifts we’re seeing right now. So I don’t think it’s simply a continuation of something that began last year. I think it’s probably a little bit of what went on last year as well as the increased turbulence that’s been associated with some of the shifts in the channel alliances. 
Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you. And one last clean-up question pivoting to capital deployment. What do you define as a larger deal? And I know you talked about your capacity in the context of free cash flow. Is the right way to do the math here just look at our free cash flow projections and assume a reasonable leverage ratio and that’s how big you could go in the aggregate over the next year or so? Thank you. 
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. I mean, we would be -- when we talk larger deal, it’s a -- we view Cepheid, a $4 billion deal, is a larger-type deal.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. And then is that math logic pretty safe?
Daniel L. Comas: Yeah, I mean that’s about a year or a little bit more a year of free cash flow, plus the earnings you bring on from the acquisitions.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Steve Beuchaw: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot of tough questions out this morning so far on the call, so I’m going to go easy.
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, please don’t let us down now.
Steve Beuchaw: No, no, no. I am -- I consider myself a part of the team here. One team, one dream. The first one is that one that normally come up early, which is, could we just spend just a minute on a couple of areas in terms of the end-market metrics that tend to be high-focused and some are controversial? One is pharma. I saw the commentary in your prepared remarks on the pharma was very, very positive, and it’s fair to say that pharma is holding up and were sort of pass any concerns about the slowdown tied to drug pricing or any other boogieman. And then, I think with the NIH, I think, in the commentary you call that was stable, but I suppose that might be raised and hope for 3Q, because we have an NIH budget, or whether its federal budget. I mean, should we be thinking about 3Q possible being a little better? And then for Dan, shifting gears, I wonder if you can comment on just a couple of things. One, Easter timing, do you think that was at all material in terms of, not necessarily selling days, but activity in the quarter? And then, Dan, how should be think about the tax rate for the second half? Thanks for humoring my many, many questions.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Steve, thanks. So let’s start with pharma. We continue to remain very positive on the pharma market and specifically the biologics portion of the pharma market. As you may have heard us mentioned in the past, we have about $1.5 billion worth of revenue that’s attached to the pharma market, and specifically in the biologics area, and these are largely around the bulk of assets at Pall and at SCIEX as well as a couple of other life science businesses. There is a lot of strong macro drivers, I think, underlying our continued optimism around pharma, specifically around the growth of biologic drugs, the shift from small molecule, investments in small molecule development. It’s a large molecule development. I think you’ve heard us mentioning a number of the statistics that are supportive of that in the past. You mentioned drug pricing, Steve. That does get some air time these days. I think drug pricing, in combination with just broader uncertainty around ACA, I think certainly has to have some impact on pharma companies today. We’ve certainly seen some of our customers manage inventories a little bit more tightly, I think, make sure that they’re managing their cost structures. We feel very – pretty well insulated from a lot of that because we produced a very high-value consumable at relatively low cost of the overall manufacturing process of a biologic. But nevertheless, these are factors that have to influence these customers in the macro. So while we feel extremely positive about the biologics market continuing, clearly you’ll hear a little bit of noise in the market about uncertainty associated with some of those factors. You did hear me mention accurately about our business in the academic market relatively stable. I think that was specifically probably around SCIEX. That being said, you mentioned NIH. NIH, direct NIH spending is a relatively small portion of our overall life science business. And so while it’s always encouraging to see NIH spending increased, the absolute impact on that, given our small direct NIH spending presence, means it’s a good thing but ultimately doesn’t really move the needle that dramatic. I think it’s a good macro indicator, but I probably wouldn’t go much further than that.
Daniel L. Comas: And, Steve, just on the other questions, we expect our tax rate to remain about 20.5% for the balance of the year. We do expect our cash tax payments to be down materially versus prior year. We had exceptionally high cash taxes last year somewhat related to separation. Because of that and because of our strong year-to-date free cash flow, I know we have talked in April about a sort of an expectation of high single-digit growth for free cash flow, we now expect double-digit growth of free cash flow for the full year. Regarding Easter timings, we did hear a little bit of noise, more European businesses, that are having some modest impact to them in the second quarter, but I’m not sure we want to go more than that.
Steve Beuchaw: Thank you so much for all the color, guys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: I was hoping to visit the decision on the VERIS product line shutting that down, what was the tipping point? And just to be clear, this was shut down and not sold and might should we considering other similar actions elsewhere?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Deane, this was a product line discontinuation. It was not a sale or any form of a transaction like that. In terms of a tipping point, I don’t know that there would be necessarily a single point. This was something that we knew or thought about, I should say, as a possibility when we were going through diligence. Obviously, it was well understood that we were going to have an additional product line in molecular diagnostics. What we couldn’t necessarily fully understand until we got beyond diligence close the transaction and really got underneath the product roadmap was the ability for us to continue to scale the gene expert platform and infinity over time both in terms of menu as well as in terms of daily volume or throughput, if you will. And so, as we came to understand the potential that was represented by the Cepheid platform and that unique architecture that they developed, we then were able to really map that against the capabilities of the VERIS platform, the runway in terms of menu expansion of VERIS and the associated process for FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals, and we found that not only did we have a tremendous opportunity in terms of scalability, throughput and assay development, but really it accelerated our position beyond what we anticipated in due diligence. And so it really was through what I think was a pretty thoughtful analysis that really was a team effort between the Cepheid team and the Beckman diagnostic team. They came to a unified conclusion that this was in the best interest of our diagnostic portfolio.
Deane Dray: That’s a good color. And then just as a follow-up, and I hope I don’t get the flag for piling on on dental here but, we’ve been dancing around this destocking question, and interestingly, one of your biggest competitors has been talking recently about taking share in this space, and I just was hoping you could comment on that. So beyond the channel alignment noise, have you lost share in the consumable side?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: I see no flags throw. Happy to take questions on dental in any dimension. There is no question because -- about the impact of destocking here, because we have a relatively high level of transparency with our major distribution partners around sell out byproduct category for us and against the house. So it’s a mathematical equation. We also have outstanding dialogue and transparency with our channel partners around what their current inventory levels are in terms of weeks and months and what their internal targets are managing their own balance sheet situation. So, I think we are on firm ground factually. I think, from a product line standpoint, I mention that we’ve actually seen good growth in a number of our dental product lines. I think, in those areas where -- on the traditional consumables side, where clearly there has been the weakness that we’ve noticed, while the destocking is pretty mathematical, could there be shifts between individual competitors inside the house that we don’t get full transparency to, certainly it’s possible. But I would say, today, if we lost any share in the consumables side, it would be very marginal.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. Can you give us an update on the Cepheid integration? Are you tracking ahead of plan? And do you think you’ve seen some more low-hanging fruit in terms of synergies than maybe you initially anticipated?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks for the question. Cepheid integration has gone extremely well. We have a wonderful team of long-time Cepheid associates, many of whom are in the top leadership positions around the business, and we’ve supplemented that team with a small number of key leaders from the Danaher side: one in operations, one in finance, just to name a couple. And I think the combination of that long-term Cepheid leadership team as well as some of the Danaher associates have continued to make exceptional progress. That progress has really come on the back of a consistent use of the tools of the Danaher business system. Some of that has come in the form of manufacturing productivity improvements, higher levels of volume being moved through given manufacturing cells at lower headcount levels in some cases, but in other cases, simply a function of being able to keep up with the growing demand at the same level of headcount, and therefore, driving higher levels of productivity. So, we’re thrilled with the progress that the team is making operationally. In terms of some of the low-hanging fruits that you asked about, I think it’s been pretty consistent with the expectations that we had. Low-hanging fruit in an acquisition integration typically starts with public company cost, and those company cost have come out of the business. We seen – we’ve seen very good improvement in areas that we focus on, like indirect costs, which were not managed as tightly over time there as we would typically do at Danaher. We focused on purchase price variance and looking for supplier either rationalization or a combinations with existing Danaher suppliers, where we have outstanding quality and delivery, and some of that integration of suppliers has led to improvement in gross margins from a material cost perspective, and we continued to drive those improvements over time.  In addition to that, I think commercially the teams are working very well together. While we maintain an independent commercial team at Cepheid, we have a tremendous lead-sharing process going on between the businesses across the balance of our diagnostic platform, more enhancing our feet on the street in high-growth markets, specifically in China. I’ve talked about that in a couple of our past conversations. And so we think the opportunities for using the tools of DBS commercially terming driving higher market visibility, leveraging the commercial reach and capabilities of the balance of the diagnostic platform, all set us up very well for continuing good performance at Cepheid. So we couldn’t be happier about the performance both in terms of core growth, operating margin and free cash flow at Cepheid thus far.
Erin Wright: Excellent. Thanks. And a follow-up acquisition pipeline and the regulatory environment, specifically on timing, and do any other regulatory uncertainties de-rail our alternatively expedite your decision making process when it comes to acquisitions? How aggressive can you be on the M&A front near term?
Thomas Patrick Joyce: I wouldn’t say we see anything in the regulatory environment that would create any undue uncertainty or create any hesitations. We talked earlier today about the capabilities we have with the tremendous free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet. I think we’re extremely well positioned to put that balance sheet to work during the balance of this year and certainly into next year.
Erin Wright: Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. 
Dan Arias: Hi, thanks very much for the question. Maybe just quickly on Pall, unless I missed it. Hoping you can maybe put some numbers around the revenue impact that the Middle East project comp had on the quarter and then how that compares to the headwind that you saw there in 1Q?
Daniel L. Comas: It was about a $10-plus million project both in Q1 and in Q2, and that’s we will not have that comparison here in the third and fourth quarter.
Dan Arias: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Cepheid and the pipeline there. I think we’re coming up on the period where the prior team was targeting the point-of-care launch with the omni. Obviously, you guys have your own plan, has your own timeline there, but just wondering if you might be willing to comment on how you’re thinking about that product and that market, what our expectations there should be, now especially as ACC comes around the corner here. 
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks. You are asking about the omni product line, which we, the prior management team, put in play from our R&D perspective before we acquired the business. We got a chance to get inside the omni product launch opportunity in a great depth. We think that’s an exceptional product with tremendous opportunities. We challenged the team to really make sure that they had done the type of diligence on the technology as well as the commercial side of launching that product. We did that partly through due diligence and then certainly through the strategic plans and the product roadmap reviews that we’ve had. That product is, we’re confident we can launch that product in the first half of next year. I think that product has any exceptional opportunity to drive point-of-care position and an exceptional level of assay capability that will truly revolutionize the point-of-care market. So we feel very good about omni, and we feel good about the launch schedule that we’ve established.
Dan Arias: Okay. Thanks very much for that.
Thomas Patrick Joyce: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: And that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.

Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We’re off to a good start in 2017. During the first quarter, our two most recent, larger acquisitions Pall and Cepheid, performed very well. We drove share gains in a number of our operating companies and achieved high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continued to reinvest in our businesses to enhance our long-term growth trajectory, and we feel well-positioned to benefit from compelling market drivers across the portfolio. Today, you will hear a number of examples of how our focus on innovation and key commercial initiatives enable us to provide customers with new technologies and solutions that they need to improve critical processes. By prioritizing this targeted reinvestment, we believe that we can strengthen our competitive advantage and better position our portfolio for sustainable long-term outperformance. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 7% to $4.2 billion and core revenue grew 2.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up low single digits. High growth markets grew at a mid single digit rate led by continued strength in China and India. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from last year. Our core operating margin declined 15 basis points, and reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 14.8%. These declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, incremental growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange rates. In terms of M&A, we announced two acquisitions for nearly a $100 million, both of which are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. As we move through the year, we will continue to focus primarily on small and midsized acquisitions. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.85, which represents an increase of 8% over last year. Now, let’s take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 4% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.2%. And core operating margin increased 165 basis points. This strong margin improvement was broad-based across the platform including Pall and is reflective of the team executing well using DBS. At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate. Ongoing strength in our Flow Cytometry and Particle Counting businesses was modestly offset by declines in certification [ph]. Developed markets was slightly softer mainly due to the timing of certain projects, while strong momentum continued in China where local investment in research and biopharma drove another quarter of sustained growth in the region. Beckman reinforced its commitment to innovation during the quarter with the launch of the Biomek i-Series automated workstations. This new automated liquid handling platform provides consistent sample preparation with greater efficiency, adaptability and reliability. The Biomek i-Series launch is the combination of a focused R&D process, which included obtaining extensive voice of the customer and during which the team worked with end users around the world to identify vital features for a new platform. One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen. And by better understanding our customers Beckman was able to deliver market-driven innovation and ensure that new products like the Biomek i-Series will provide critical solutions for scientists’ evolving needs. Core revenue at SCIEX was up low-single-digits, driven by growth in Western Europe and China. We saw good demand in the pharmaceutical end market across all major geographies with particular strength in China where tightened regulations around generic drug production are generating greater demand for testing. Leica Microsystems delivered high-single-digit revenue growth as all major regions and product lines showed positive performance. North America and Western Europe were driven by several key project wins, particularly in our confocal and surgical businesses. Pall’s call revenue grew low-single-digits with mid-single-digit growth at Pall Life Sciences led by gain across our biopharmaceutical business, particularly in single use technologies. Pall Industrial’s core revenue was down slightly versus the tough prior year comparison. This was largely the result of a sizeable project in the Middle East in the first half of 2016. Our microelectronics and aerospace businesses continue to perform very well. We saw signs of stabilization across a number of our industrial and process end-markets. We were also encouraged by strong bookings throughout the quarter. We’re well-positioned in our biopharma business and expect we will continue to benefit from the long-term trends in this end market, including the shift from small to large molecule drugs and the increasing proliferation of single use technologies across biopharma production processes. A great example of Pall’s leadership in this space was on display of the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in March where we featured a number of recent innovations like the BioSMB continuous chromatography system and the Cadence Acoustic Separator, which are helping customers improve the efficiency of their bio-production workflows. Turning now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 17% and core revenue increased 2.5%. Reported operating margins declined to 11.6%, in part due to recent acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 240 basis points and were negatively impacted by the strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies along with incremental growth investments in R&D, service and commercial initiatives. Radiometer’s core revenue grew high-single-digits with positive results across all major geographies. Our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well and double-digit instrument sales helped to expand Radiometer’s installed base and drive strong recurring revenue growth. At Leica Biosystems, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate, led by growth in the developed markets and China. Advanced staining performed very well across both instruments and consumables while our core histology and tissue acquisition product lines declined. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low single digits, with strength in high growth markets, partially offset by weakness in Western Europe and North America. Our business in China delivered another strong quarter as meaningful install based expansion in the region contributed to healthy recurring revenue growth. Cepheid is off to a great start and achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Through the thoughtful application of DBS, the team has implemented numerous process improvements to increase productivity since acquisition. These initiatives have already generated meaningful operating margin expansion and we are very encouraged by this early progress. Cepheid also received FDA clearance for its Xpert Xpress flu and RSV respiratory virus test in March. Both of these tests deliver molecular results in as little as 20 minutes, twice as fast as their predecessors and with comparable accuracy. The first 24 hours of flu and RSV symptom onset is a critical window and the Xpress test’s faster turnaround time enables clinicians to access reliable diagnoses and targeted therapies for the patients that much more quickly. Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenue growth was roughly flat in the first quarter. Core operating margin declined 85 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 13.6%. This margin decline was largely driven by weakness in our higher margin traditional consumables business. Solid demand continued for our specialty product lines including orthodontics and implants, and we saw positive growth in our equipment business. We anticipate the weakness across our traditional consumables business will persist in the near-term, leading to similar growth rates in Q2 as we saw in Q1 for the overall Dental platform. In the meantime, we remain focused on enhancing our dental portfolio’s foundation for long-term growth. Recent cost structure improvements have facilitated reinvestment in the business to drive growth through commercial initiatives and through innovation. At the International Dental Show in March, we featured more than 10 new products from across our dental platform, including the SMARTmatic handpiece campaign, KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-Ray imaging system. We also featured DTX Studio, a single digital software platform that connects a dental office across its entire workflow from diagnosis to design and patient treatment. These innovative technologies enable an entire Dental team to work more effectively and most importantly support better treatment outcomes for patients. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Both reported core revenue were up 4.5%, reported margins were 22.7% with core operating margins up 60 basis points due to broad based DBS execution across the segment. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by positive momentum in our marking and coding equipment and related consumables businesses across all major geographies. We also saw increased demand for our Packaging and Color Solutions products. In March, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Vision Technology over AVT, a leader in automatic print inspection, process control and quality assurance with over 7,000 systems installed at customer sites worldwide. AVT’s in-line print inspection systems are used by the world’s top packaging and label convertors to improve product quality and operational efficiency, and the business is highly complementary to X-Rite’s color inspection capabilities and Esko’s packaging work flow. We believe that this combination of solutions will enable us to better serve our customers by simplifying their management of complex packaging value chains. And we look forward to welcoming the AVT team to Danaher. Videojet continued to outperform in the quarter, delivering mid-single digit core revenue growth as the business grew across all product lines and most major geographies. Videojet’s service offering delivered another great quarter, and the team’s focus on lifecycle service initiatives continues to enhance customers’ experience with greater productivity and more uptime to help reduce their operating costs. The application of DBS to Videojet’s equipment sales and service approach continues to drive higher service contract attachment rates at both existing and new accounts. Core revenue at both Esko and X-Rite was up low single digits and a number of new products we introduced at the Drubish [ph] trade show last summer had gained good traction in the market.  Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a mid single digit rate. Throughout the first quarter, we were encouraged by improved momentum across our more industrial oriented businesses and we believe that we continue to gain share relative to the market across the entire platform. At Hach, mid single digit core revenue growth was supported by growth in North America and Western Europe off improving order trends that we started to see through the end of last year. In the high growth markets, China performed well, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. Solid growth across most across major product lines was led by instrument sales as we expanded our install based. For decades, Hach has pioneered in advanced coring analysis for municipal and industrial water treatment. The team continued to build on a long tradition of innovation and new product development with the recent announcement of the CM130 coring monitoring system, the first of its kind cleared by the FDA for use in the medical field. The CM130 automatically tests coring levels at dialysis centers every 5 to 20 minutes, providing frequent analysis and immediate notification of high coring [ph] events via remote indicators in the patient treatment area. It was developed in collaboration with one of the leading dialysis providers in the U.S. and is a tremendous example of Hach partners with customers to deliver connected instruments that provide actionable insights and decision support. In our water treatment businesses, both for Trojan and ChemTreat achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Growth at Trojan was driven by key project wins in Western Europe, Asia and Latin America. And ChemTreat’s growth was led by gains in both North -- and Latin America, which were largely driven by incremental improvements in the oil and gas sector. So, to wrap up. This is a good star to the year. Pall and Cepheid both performed well, we drove share gains at a number of our operating companies and we continued to reinvest in our businesses in order to enhance our portfolio’s growth trajectory. There are compelling secular market drivers across each of our five platforms, and we feel very well-positioned to take advantage of these going forward. At the same time, we see tremendous opportunities to enhance our growth and margin profile through focused execution across the portfolio. And with the Danaher Business System continuing to serve as our foundation, we believe that we’ll be able deliver long-term outperformance for shareholders. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.95 and $0.98, which assumes second quarter core revenue growth comparable to the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Scott Davis with Barclays. 
Scott Davis: Maybe I’m a little dense. But, can you help walk through the diagnostic core margin delta? So, it’s down 240 basis points and you said some of that is currency. Can you help us understand how much of that is currency?
Tom Joyce: Well, we know you’re not dense. So, let’s start with that [multiple speakers]. And it’s early. Scott, starting with FX impact, which is in the neighborhood of a 100 basis points of the impact year-on-year, really has virtually everything to do with the year-on-year strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the yen, especially the yen through the first quarter. If you think about our diagnostic business, we manufacture a great deal of our products in the U.S. and in Japan, particularly at Beckman Diagnostics. But with revenue spread as globally as it is, the high cost impact, the impact of that currency, given the strengthening of both those currencies had an impact on that ratio between where our cost structure is from a manufacturing standpoint and where those revenues are ultimately translated. So, that’s the core, the FX impact. In addition to that, obviously growth was a little softer that largely came through in March, somewhat Beck DX in North America certainly and little bit of like a biosystems in the high growth markets. So, the slightly lighter core growth in a business that has a high level of recurring revenue certainly had an impact, and we’re probably talking about in the neighborhood of 75 basis points of impact there. And then, we did have a little bit of a mix at Beck DX with a couple of larger automation related deals shipped in the first quarter. And when we have a high level of automation equipment associated with both those projects that tends to be a little bit of a margin headwind that’s ultimately over time good news for us. When we sell automation with the equipment that automation gets bolted to the floor and that becomes an outstanding long-term account situation, because obviously it’s a very sticky situation when you have that much equipment wired to an automation line, running high volume recurring revenues. So, those are the major components there, Scott. Hopefully that’s helpful.
Scott Davis: Yes. Nowadays, it sounds like some timing issues there. So, okay, I probably ask this question in multiple quarters but on Dental, do you have a sense of what there was a inventory destock at the distributor level or whether the end markets just soft or is there any price pressure there? I mean, how do you -- I m just trying to reconcile flat revenues and down margins when taking costs out of the business.
Tom Joyce: Well, we have a little bit of both the major factors that you’d point to at the outset there. Definitely, you have some softness in the end market; that phenomena began in the latter part of second half of last year and we think it continued here in the first quarter. But, when you have that phenomenon, obviously the channel becomes that much more concerned about inventory levels and is going to try to bring down inventory levels, commensurate with how they think that end market as a sell-through is happening. So, you have a combination of both those factors that to some extent from a manufacture perspective, compound themselves somewhat. The phenomenon is generally oriented towards the North American market, a little bit in Europe but more North American in terms of its impact and it’s primarily around the traditional consumables market. And so, when you have that impact obviously on the consumables end of our portfolio, that’s where significant impact comes through on the margin side. Now, on the good news side, if you look at the parts of the portfolio, and it’s a good deal of the portfolio that is not in the traditional consumables end of the product lines and does not go through distribution, those product lines generally perform very well. Ormco or orthodontic business continued to perform well; Implants and Nobel and both those go direct, were both low-single-digit; mid-single-digit quarter performances. Equipment was up low-single-digits broadly. So, I think there is some positive things there, but they were outweighed by that impact of the traditional consumables business and obviously the commensurate impact on the margins. We feel very good, to your point about the costs that we have taken out in the business. You saw a very good margin improvement throughout the course of the last 12 to 18 months. We continue to take cost out of the portfolio. But at the same time, you’ve heard us talk about the Danaher playbook. We are continuing to invest in that business. We believe that the longer term growth drivers are there. And so, I think it’s important that we continue to focus on ensuring that we are well-positioned commercially across a number of geographies and that we’re continuing to invest in innovation. So, it’s a tough balancing act, but we believe it’s right for the long-term.
Operator: And we’ll next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys. So, I just wanted to talk first maybe a bit about Cepheid. It looked like when I teased out the numbers, it was quite a very strong start to the year for them relative to what we were expecting at least. As you look at sort of the pipeline there and your channel opportunities and you start to understand what’s under the new products, the momentum that business could have, obviously you talked about 10% plus. It seems like it was much more of that in Q1. I guess, how are you thinking about variety of drivers and then what drove some of that outperformance or what appears to be in this quarter?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Ross. Yes. We did have a very good quarter at Cepheid We’re extremely pleased with how that business has performed and how the team has come together and adapted to the Danaher environment, have utilized the tools of the Danaher Business System to drive improvements, not only in terms of the way they’re driving business commercially, but I think importantly, the way they are taking cost out of various areas of business and redeploying some of those savings back into investments for growth. And we’re starting to see the impact of that obviously across the top-line, where we talked about double-digit growth and meaningful margin improvements as well, now margin improvements that are in the double-digit range for sure. So, in terms of what’s driving that growth. It’s pretty well -- it’s pretty broad across the portfolio. Infectious disease, sexual health continues to perform quite well. Hospital acquired infections, while growing a little bit more modestly than the rest of the portfolio, we think are in a very sustainable position over time. And we’re very encouraged by the investments that are being made around advancing the menu and as well as the new instruments that come out. So, I think the business is off to a great start. We’ve seen some good performance and we very much expect that to continue.
Ross Muken: And maybe just follow-up on China. It seems like that market continues to be white-hot and sort of the demand is greater than many were sort of estimating 3, 6, 12 months ago. I mean, how do you think about the duration? There are so many moving parts at the macro level there; I mean some of the underlying drivers in the healthcare businesses seem pretty secular. But on the cyclical side, how are you thinking about how much longer that market can kind of continue to accelerate and then maybe remain elevated.
Tom Joyce: We feel very good about how we’re positioned in China, Ross, across really each of the five platforms. Our diagnostic platform continues to perform very well and we continue to invest there. We see that growth coming through really across the board, Beckman Diagnostics, Radiometer like the bio-systems. And now, as we’re investing more aggressively Cepheid in the high growth markets, China will become an increasingly important part of Cepheid’s geographic profile. As you know, they’ve been underpenetrated in a number of those markets. Our dental business, Ross, continues to drive consistent double-digit growth each quarter and has for a quite a period of time. We think the underlying drivers in the dental market as well as our outstanding execution and the breadth of that portfolio, speak well to the long-term potential in Dental. Life Science investments continue to be a priority for the Chinese government. While those can sometime shift occasionally between end markets, for example from the food market to maybe primarily basic research in generalizing the underlying drivers around life sciences are quite good. Water Quality, I think we all have an appreciation for the challenges around the environment in China. And the Chinese government’s continued to make the environment and water in particular priority. And we’ve seen some good performance so far this year from our water quality business in China. And PID I think also is well-positioned. So, across the portfolio, we feel great about the Chinese market and the opportunities we have there for sustained double-digit performance.
Dan Comas: And Ross, as Tom noted, the acceleration from sort of high-single-digit growth last year to the double-digit growth we saw in the first quarter, was more the breadth -- wasn’t that that health care businesses got stronger, it’s more about the consistent double-digit growth across all the five platforms.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Tom, I want to start with Biopharma. We’ve had some mixed data points, certainly this year, Rhodes [ph] have gotten trouble and we even heard from Sartorius and then some of the other European companies about softness. So, given the mid single digit growth in Pall Life Science for you guys, can you maybe talk about some of the trends here you’re seeing and what you’re hearing from customers? Obviously there’s been more noise on drug pricing this week with J&J and others kind of calling that out.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Tycho, we don’t -- we play such a vital role in the biopharma manufacturing process at a relatively low cost to that manufacturing process, the filtration as a component of the overall manufacturing cost is relatively modestly, arguably even marginal, but the value is so high that we think filtration is a very sustainable position across biopharma over the long term. Relative to the overall trend, I think both the high growth of large molecule drugs today that are in the market as well as the pipelines being skewed towards large molecule drugs, both speak well to the long-term growth trajectory of biopharma. There is no question, that’s where all the investment is going over time. And filtration is used more intensively in large molecule drug production than in small molecule drug production. So, I think when we look at it from a macro perspective, we still feel very positive about how the biopharma, particularly manufacturing rates will be sustained over time and how that will benefit Pall, and frankly others of our Life Science businesses that participate in that market. So, certainly, some concerns about that relative to drug prancing, but we think we’re relatively well-positioned in terms of the impact there.
Tycho Peterson: And then, can you maybe comment on SCIEX up low-single-digit? I know only 40% of that business is biopharma, but can you maybe just talk about trends for that and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year?
Tom Joyce: Sure. SCIEX business has performed exceptionally well over a long period of time. We did post low-single-digit growth here in the quarter. We have a pretty big service business at SCIEX and that was impacted a bit by the one less selling day. So, our outlook is pretty consistent with our past performance, more like mid-single-digit growth in Q3 and beyond. From an end market perspective pharma was an excellent growth driver during the course of the quarter, double-digits led -- it led the way double-digit growth. Applied was more flattish, but finished the quarter a little bit better, so the growth rate -- the order rates were improving through the course for the quarter. China is a very good market there for us, particularly in the applied markets, meaning food and environmental. We have had a bit of tough comp on the clinical side, given some of the changes to -- in physician office lab, reimbursement and so on, and academic has been comp as well. So, those were a little bit of the pluses and minuses. But in general, as we look forward, given the one of our selling day, the service business, how we’ve seen the installed based growth, the order rates, we feel good about SCIEX in the quarters ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask one last clarification on Pall Industrial. You had the Middle East project you called out for Pall Industrial. Would Pall Industrial have grown excluding that?
Dan Comas: Yes. In fact, orders were up mid-single-digit in Q1 for Pall all up as opposed to the low-single-digit on the revenue basis because it is prior year, equipment installed that we had in the Middle East, both in Q1 and we’ll also have piece of that in Q2 as well.
Tycho Peterson: Okay.
Tom Joyce: Maybe one last point, I know you didn’t ask about it, but it’s probably just a quick mention relative to Phenomenex, which was an acquisition that was led by the SCIEX team and that business is off to a great start. We closed that in the fourth quarter, and it’s been up mid-single-digit since we acquired that business, a little bit of challenging comp in the first quarter, but we’ll lap right over that. So that team’s doing a wonderful job and we couldn’t be happier with the start we have there.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Derik.
Derik De Bruin: Hey. I’m going to follow up on Tycho’s question there. So, any signs at all in the U.S. academic market in particular that there is any hesitation in terms of ordering or wanting to spend money just given some of the uncertainties in Washington around funding?
Tom Joyce: Peering into the psychology is a challenging thing for me. We’ve seen what’s going on in terms of the proposed budgets and so on. So, I think there has to be a little bit of concern and hesitation out there. But it’s not like we can point to something very specific that impacted our order rates. In terms of NIH funding specifically, we don’t -- as I think you probably know already, we don’t have a very high degree of direct exposure to NIH funding, less than 5% of our Life Science sales comes directly from the NIH and somewhat more than that indirectly. But when you step back and you look at our life science business, approaching half the businesses goes into pharma, mostly biopharma and applied, food and environmental. And then of course you have actually some more industrially oriented exposure in our Life Science business. Our academic and research exposure is probably sub-20%. And yes, I think there is some hesitation out there but I can’t point to specific projects. Interestingly, I think maybe one counterpoint would be Leica Microsystems had a terrific quarter. And those products, particularly confocals can be the types of high CapEx expenditures that can give some folks pause in the academic and the research area. And we saw good growth there over the course of the quarter. So, a little bit of a counterpoint that would make for uncertainty.
Derik De Bruin: And just one follow-up on this, R&D expense in the quarter is 6.4% of sales, how should we look about this rolling across for the rest of the year?
Dan Comas: Part of the step up was organic and part of it was the inclusion of Cepheid in the number, but we should be in that sort of ZIP code through the year.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Shannon O’Callaghan with UBS.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Tom, just wondering, how you view the past from this kind of organic level up to something closer to 4%, I guess some of the acquisitions going organic maybe as a piece and getting this dental consumables off the math. But you also mentioned several times investments and innovation, commercial initiatives, are the investments you’re making, are the payoffs going to ramp from those type of things, do you have visibility into that just wondering sort of the path from 2.5 up to 4?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Shannon, you’ve hit on a number of the key drivers, even within your question. Clearly, the acquisitions will have some impact as Cepheid and Phenomenex come into the core later on this year, we would expect to see some impact there. Yes, absolutely, we would need to see some improvement in the dental consumables market. As we’ve said in the past, these types of slowdowns tend to write themselves over time, both in terms of the channel inventories as well as the overall sell-through, if you will. So, I think we will see some improvement there, probably not in the second quarter but more likely in the second half. And yes, we’ve made -- we continue to make investments. Derik asked us about R&D as a percent of sales; we continue to invest in R&D as well as in commercial initiatives. And we do see payoffs there. We’ve seen them in the past; we’ve seen, for example, at SCIEX, where we’ve increased R&D as a percent of sales from 7% years ago around the acquisition, now to 10% and where the flow of new products has been dramatically increased, and that’s led to the sustained growth rates and the improvement in share gains. I think Videojet is another tremendous example of where, not only the power of DBS, but the investments in R&D and commercial initiatives globally have expanded their service offering, their remote capabilities. We often refer to them as the lifecycle initiatives that have driven better service contract attachment. We’ve seen mid-single-digit growth at Videojet consistently over a seven-year of period. And that’s the impact of work that was done a number of years ago in terms of new products and commercial investment. So, as we get to some of the more investments that are making more on a near-term basis, it will take time for those to pay-off. But it’s clear that investments that we’ve been in the past have had real impact? So, that gives us confidence that over time, and over time is longer than a couple of quarters, even though we do expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year, but we know these investments pay off in time.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Okay, great. And then just on cash flow, operating cash flow is down a little bit year-over-year and the CapEx was up, maybe just little color on those dynamics of both of those components?
Dan Comas: Shannon, the primary driver in the operating cash flow is really just the timing around tax payments. Our tax payments were $60 million, $70 million higher Q1. As you remember, we had relatively modest tax payments the first three quarters of last year and then very, very heavy tax payments, over 400 million in the fourth quarter. I think you’ll see more normalization of that as we go through the year. I think we’re set up for again high-single-digit 10% sort of growth in free cash flow for the full year. The CapEx increased primarily the new acquisitions, Cepheid, Phenomenex and again just some timing issues as well.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.
Doug Schenkel: Good morning. I want to start by going back to Pall. Mid-single-digit Life Science revenue growth is good, but weaker than we had in our model, our moderation below recent trend. I just want to be clear that you would distribute the moderation in growth to a tougher double-digit revenue growth comparison rather than any change in market conditions. And relatively, what assumptions for Pall growth are embedded into guidance for the balance of the year, especially given some of the strong bookings commentary that you shared earlier on the Q&A?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Doug, that mid-single-digit growth at Pall Life Science really had some impact of the one last selling day. So that’s probably the first impact that we would point to. Overall, we see that market, as I mentioned earlier, continue to have great underlying and very fundamental drivers, utilization of filtration, continue to be an important part of large molecule drug. So, we don’t see anything that would suggest that there’d be any moderation in that business. In fact, we would see it as being a pretty consistent performer over time. So, we feel good about that. Doug, remind me; I am sorry. What was the second part of your question?
Dan Comas: He’s asking about what’s embedded in the guidance for the full year. We would expect comparable low-single-digit growth in the second quarter, again absent the project that we shipped half of that in the first quarter, half of the equipment in the second quarter of last year, we would expect to be mid single digit. So, we would expect order growth closer to mid single digits in the second quarter. And we think that t’s this up from mid single digit growth at Pall in the second half for the year.
Doug Schenkel: Okay. And that’s a good segue to I guess my follow-up. Your guidance for the second quarter for core growth is around 3%. This is against a slightly more difficult year-over-year comparison versus what’s the case in the first quarter. Can you help us peel out [ph] in which segments or end markets you expect growth to improve in the second quarter versus what you saw in the first quarter?
Tom Joyce: I think what we said in the script is we expect growth comparable to what we had -- core growth comparable to what we had in the first quarter. And looking at across the four segments, we would expect roughly similar performance for each of the four segments in the second quarter.
Doug Schenkel: Lastly, real just quick one. Did flu contribute meaningfully to Cepheid growth in the quarter? There is some commentary out there and some data out there that suggests that that could have been an outsized driver in the quarter. Could you comment on whether that was the case? Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Flu? Doug, we’re not far enough [ph] beyond the separation of [multiple speakers].
Dan Comas: We all misheard that.
Tom Joyce: Sorry. There was a pregnant pause there, now you know why.
Doug Schenkel: Influenza.
Tom Joyce: Influenza, right, in the publically available market data on flu it was “a good flu season”. I’m not sure I would describe it is an outsized impact but in general, it was a good flu season and that contributed to the overall growth.
Operator: We will go next to see Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Steve Beuchaw: I have an easy one for Dan and then I’ll apologize; I have a more complicated one for Tom. The easy question for Dan is, hey, Dan, can you just help us understand and you’ve alluded to this a little bit in discussions around service and around Pall. Where the selling day impact in the quarter might have been more or less significant across the businesses just so we can tune up the models appropriately? And then, question for Tom -- the question for Tom is you’re uniquely qualified to think about multilayered distribution strategies across the businesses given your experience, not just at Danaher but what is now Fortive. And so, I wonder how you’re thinking as you work with your, particularly your life sciences and dental teams about ecommerce. It seems to be one of the more important questions that management teams in the space are thinking about, what’s the right time to use ecommerce as a way to get closer to customers and potentially to think about it as a lever to improve margins in those businesses. So, I wonder if you could give you -- the wisdom of your experience across the businesses that you might be sharing with those managements teams as they think about how and when to become more active with ecommerce partners? Thanks so much.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Steve, I’ll take the first one. 
Steve Beuchaw: Sure.
Tom Joyce: So, Steve, I’ll take the first one and then again come back on the impacts of the selling days and so on. Thank you for the comment. I’m not sure how uniquely qualified I am, but I do have some perspectives for certain about how we think about layered distribution strategies or you might say multipronged distribution strategies across each of our platforms. You asked about Life Sciences and Dental, but let me talk broadly first. When we think about ecommerce, when we think about selling directly to customers through either our own portal or someone else’s portal, we think about how customers want to buy. That’s first and foremost. There is no point in having an ecommerce strategy if you determine that customers have no interest in buying that way for a variety of different reasons. So, the typical characteristics of products where we’ve had great success strategically using ecommerce have been lower dollar value products, high usage, high turn products, products that are ordered somewhat routinely that require somewhat limited or more limited technical support and certainly more levels of service. So, when you have products like that, customers generally want it to be easy to buy. And a great example of that for us is our Hach business. In the Hach business, sales to municipalities and industrial facilities, we install an instrument and then there is a routine level of usage of consumables that the customer is really familiar with. They’re relatively low cost consumables, but they’re high value consumables. Customer is super familiar with them, so they don’t need a lot of technical support and they don’t need any service.\ And as a result of that, Hach is growing their ecommerce business high-single-digits to double-digits consistently over, frankly, as many years as I can remember. Admittedly, we started off a small base a number of years ago, but we continue to invest there. I think that’s a great example of where we’ve used it very strategically and aligned ecommerce with the way customers want to buy. Now to go back to some of the areas specifically in your question, there is a whole bunch of products in our life science platform where ecommerce isn’t terribly well suited to procurement of a confocal microscope from -- like a Microsystems or mass spectrometer from AB SCIEX. But clearly, consumables for our Flow Cytometry business would be a great example. In the Dental platform, there are lots of opportunities for ecommerce. What we generally found is that the channel as it exists today, particularly in North America, provides those ecommerce capabilities. Whether you’re talking about Schein or Patterson or Benco or anyone of a number of others, they do quite a nice job with relatively low costs, low-tech, quick carrying consumables on ecommerce basis. And so, one angle is to align yourself strategically with distribution that has that capability and in another case maybe to have that capability yourself, if you’re the right player and you have the destination of choice. So, those are some of the ways we think about it. Steve, hopefully that gives you some insight in terms of the way I think about it.
Dan Comas: Steve, in terms of the days issue, it really impacts our consumables business. So, the 35% of our business at instrumentation and equipment, we typically don’t see an impact when we have a change a day or two in the quarter. But across Beckman diagnostics and Dental consumables, Videojet, Hach, Pall, filtration, where they’re shipping consumables on a daily basis, we tend to fell that. In the first quarter, our equipment sales were up 2.5%; that’s been pretty consistent the last couple of quarters. But our consumables, which tend to maybe a 100 basis points, 50 to 75 basis points better than that the last couple of quarters, they were also 2.5% and we think prior that impact was because of the days.
Steve Beuchaw: Exactly, what I needed. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro: I had a question on the diagnostics business. I was wondering for a bit of an update on the Cepheid omni platform. And the reason I ask is you know that clearly market is huge opportunity, it’s still very early but it isn’t like you have couple strong first movers, making progress here that Roche recently got there going as well. So, I’m just curious kind if you put all that in context, how important that platform will be to sustain in the double digit growth you’re seeing in that franchise over a long-term period.
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Post acquisition where we’ve really gotten up close in personal with the omni platform, we were very excited about its potential. We think it has exceptional opportunities to extend the already well-characterized, Cepheid menu to lower volume environments to physician labs and closer to the point of care, certainly at what we think will be an attractive instrumentation cost level as well. We’ve got a chance to work directly with the R&D teams and the product management teams that are on omni right now. And we’re very confident in the potential of that platform. I think realistically, there were couple of things that we wanted the team to sure up, technically around that product and couple of things that we wanted to make sure were in place commercially as well. And so right now, we’re looking at probably the first, early part of next year, maybe even as early as first quarter next year for that launch, just to make sure that we have that in the best shape possible.
Isaac Ro: Great. And then, just maybe a follow-up on your earlier comments regarding the Dental business. Just trying to kind of weight which is the two factors here are maybe more important to driving better top line growth. Is it end-market performance or is it maybe more of internal kind of product line issue. And I know you guys have made some changes there over the last year, so I want to be patient, but sort of curious if it’s a market environment thing or more of a Danaher thing.
Tom Joyce: I think in the area where the softness has been most acute, the traditional consumables business, it’s really a combination of seeing some better sell-through that’s the function of just the overall market as well as the channel, being comfortable that they right size inventories and have sort of lapped over that adjustment. So, I think, those are probably the most important things on a near-term basis. I think from an internal Danaher perspective, our goal is continue to invest in innovation in the traditional consumables side as well as to continue to improve the performance in the businesses that quite frankly are already performing quite well at a mid single digit rate, like Nobel and our equipment business, particularly with the investments that we’ve made in digital dentistry where going back to a question that was asked earlier about indefinite levels that we’ve made. We 2x the number of software engineers; they’re focused on digital dentistry across the platform, and I think that’s an example of something we’re working on internally that’s an investment that will pay off over time.
Operator: And we’ll take our last question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a couple of cleanup questions here. For the Fortive spin for Dan, is there anything to call out regarding shared service agreements and anything on -- or might be some remaining stranded costs?
Dan Comas: They’re relatively -- we’re pretty far being completed with that; there are few small services back and forth. But I think size [ph] there relatively de minimis. 
Deane Dray: Got it. And then any comments on what the product lines transfer from life sciences to environmental are?
Dan Comas: That was the Pall water business.
Deane Dray: So, we’ve been waiting for this. Is there anything in terms of new product launches? There’s been discussions at some of the trade shows that you might be, that you’re launching a mobile water treatment, truck based, should we be looking for that in the near-term?
Tom Joyce: It’s really we literally just transferred the responsibility for that product line here in the first quarter over to water platform. And so, almost as if it were a newly acquired business that team is going through, I’m not sure I’d say 100-day strategic plan. But they’re looking at that business strategically and trying to figure out where the right investments are across that portfolio. There are a lot of different opportunities there, but we have to be selective about those; it’s not a huge business; it’s sub-700 million but it does need some work. And making the right investments from a product standpoint is going to be important there. So, it’s a little too early to say, but maybe in a quarter or two, we can give you some more insight.
Operator: That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the call back to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tracey, and thanks everyone for joining us. We’re around all day for questions.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 2016 was an exciting year for Danaher. And we finished on a strong note with our fourth quarter results. We were very pleased with how the team executed throughout the year, delivering solid core revenue growth, significant margin improvement, adjusted EPS growth of more than 20%, and outstanding free cash flow. The Danaher business system continues to be our foundation, our competitive advantage, and a key driver of our performance. You've heard us talk about running the Danaher playbook, meaning that we're consistently driving our businesses to improve gross and operating margins and lower G&A, all while reinvesting more into R&D and sales and marketing. In 2016 alone we improved both growth – gross and core operating margin by more than 100 basis points. At the same time we reduced G&A and meaningfully increased R&D and sales and marketing spend as a percent of sales. For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, investments in organic growth initiatives, and good execution helped drive 3% core revenue growth in a challenging macro environment. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now nearly $17 billion. From an M&A perspective in 2016 we closed eight acquisitions across all five platforms for nearly $5 billion, including our two largest deals, Cepheid and Phenomenex. We also completed the spinoff of Fortive, which was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and strategically positioning Danaher for long-term outperformance. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in 2016. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 115%, representing the 25th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. Turning now to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 6% to $4.6 billion with core revenue increasing 3.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 4%. Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up high single-digits. China and India continued to lead the way, while Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia all returned to growth in part due to easier comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits, led by growth in the U.S. and Western Europe. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 54.5%, an increase of 230 basis points from last year. And core operating margins were up 170 basis points. These strong margin results are a testament to our team's focused execution and helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.05, which represents an increase of 15% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.61, up over 20% from 2015. Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 6% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.8%. And core operating margin increased 345 basis points. This increase was driven by great execution using DBS, particularly at Pall, where the team drove a number of meaningful operational improvements. Beckman Life Sciences core revenue grew low single digits in the quarter, led by our Flow Cytometry and Particle Counting businesses. A strong finish to the year in China was capped off by another quarter of double-digit growth in the region, while weakness persisted in Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by demand for CytoFLEX, which continued to be a meaningful contributor to share gains in our Flow Cytometry business. At Leica Microsystems, we saw incremental improvements in the quarter with core revenue up low single digits. This was largely driven by North America and China, offset by declines in Japan. SCIEX increased core revenue at a mid-single-digit rate, led by growth in China and Western Europe. SCIEX's service offering had another quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets, particularly within the fast-growing biopharmaceutical space. In 2016 our Life Sciences platform delivered a significant number of new products to our biopharma customers in order to improve their bio production processes. One example is at SCIEX, where we just launched the X500B, the latest model in our X-Series mass spectrometry platform. You may remember that the first model in the series, the X500R, was designed for routine food, environmental, and forensic testing labs. Now we've added the X500B, which is specifically designed for complex biologics characterization. The X500B brings simplicity and high performance to one of the most compact mass spec footprints in the market. Its ease of use makes it accessible to even novice mass spec users and helps customers get better answers faster in their bio processing work flows. During the fourth quarter we successfully closed the acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that operates in an attractive industry adjacent to where SCIEX participates. Phenomenex is off to a great start, and we're excited to have the team on board. Over at Pall, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by Pall Life Sciences, where we saw continued demand across our Biopharmaceuticals business with particular strength in single-use technologies. Pall Industrial delivered positive results for the first time since the acquisition, with low-single-digit core revenue growth supported by strong execution in microelectronics and aerospace. This growth was offset by declines in our Process Technologies business. 2016 was a great year for Pall. And the team improved execution both operationally and commercially using the Danaher Business System. Pall delivered more than 400 basis points of operating margin expansion, improved on time delivery by over 1,500 basis points, and significantly increased their market visibility. By applying DBS principles to Pall's R&D initiatives, the team has been able to combine Pall's innovation prowess with greater executional focus to launch a number of new technologies ahead of schedule. In total Pall launched 35 new products this year, a 50% increase over last year. And the team was able to get these new products to market 25% faster. Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 11% and core revenue increased 3%. Core operating margins grew by 80 basis points. And reported operating margins declined to 12.6%, predominantly due to the acquisition related charges from the Cepheid transaction. For the full year Diagnostics core operating margins were up 200 basis points. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low single digits in the quarter, led by our immunoassay solutions. Growth across all major geographies was led by demand in high growth markets, including double digit gains in the Middle East and China. We saw better performance in North America. And importantly the team continues to drive improvement in customer retention and win rates. Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter. We saw positive performance in all major regions, with high-growth markets led by double digit growth in Latin America and China. Both our blood gas and AQT lines performed well. And we believed Radiometer continued to gain share in 2016. At Leica Biosystems core revenue declined at low single digits with growth in Western Europe and China offset by softness in North America and the Middle East. Advanced Staining Consumables achieved double-digit growth, while we saw weakness in our core Histology and Pathology imaging product lines. In November we successfully closed the acquisition of Cepheid, a leading innovator in the fast-growing area of molecular diagnostics. Cepheid is off to a good start, delivering double digit revenue growth in the quarter. And we continue to see tremendous opportunity to deliver better top and bottom line performance over time through the application of DBS. Turning to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenues increased 50 basis points and reported operating margins decreased slightly to 15.4%. While we had solid growth across our specialty product line, including Orthodontics and Implants, this was mostly offset by continued market weakness in our traditional Dental Consumables and Equipment businesses. We anticipate that these more challenging market conditions will persist into the early part of 2017. We've mentioned before that we're approaching the entire Dental platform as a new acquisition. And despite the recent market weakness, we're encouraged by the early results. In 2016 the team improved core revenue growth, added over 75 basis points of gross margin, and increased core operating margins by 90 basis points. We also lowered our G&A costs by 50 basis points, which was helped in part by a 30% reduction of our manufacturing and back office footprint. By improving the cost structure we facilitated greater investment back into the business to drive growth. We increased R&D spend by approximately 10% to reinvigorate new product development. And our investments and go-to-market initiatives are up 5% year on year to help improve our commercial execution. So overall, we feel very well positioned with our Dental portfolio and remain focused on enhancing our foundation for long term growth. Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 3.5%, with core revenue up 4%. Good execution by the team generated 210 basis points in core operating margin expansion. And reported operating margin increased to 24%. In Product Identification core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. This growth was led by strong demand for marketing and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our Packaging and Color Solutions was led by positive momentum in both North and Latin America. Videojet closed out a great year on a strong note, delivering high single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The business grew across all major product lines and geographies with particular strength in North America, Western Europe, and Latin America. Videojet also achieved another quarter of double digit service growth. And we believe that we continued to gain share relative to the market. With over 15 years of experience applying the Danaher Business System, Videojet continues to utilize DBS to drive improvements across the business. By applying DBS to drive disciplined marketing, R&D, and service growth initiatives, Videojet has achieved mid-single digit core revenue growth or better in each of the last seven years, while meaningfully expanding margins. The Videojet team continues to set a tremendous example of how we can continuously sharpen our competitive advantage with DBS. At Esko core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate on strength in both North and Latin America. While at X-Rite, core revenue was up low single digits, driven by good performance in Pantone's Color Standards business. Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single digit rate. At Hach, low single digit core revenue growth was supported by modest improvements in municipal and industrial performance in the U.S., partially offset by sluggish project activity in Eastern Europe. We are, however, encouraged by mid-single digit bookings growth in the quarter, as we saw improving order trends in both the U.S. and Western Europe. Earlier in the year, Hach launched the TU5 series turbidity meters, an innovative new technology that dramatically improves water quality testing for customers. A first in the industry, the TU5 series uses the same new detection technology in both online and lab instruments to deliver fast, accurate measurements that consistently match. This is important, as it now provides drinking water professionals with identical online and lab results, giving them superior confidence that they deliver clean, safe drinking water to their communities. This successful launch of the TU5 series has been driven by Hach's highly effective new product commercialization process and is also a great example of how Hach continues to deliver breakthrough innovation to our customers. During the fourth quarter, Trojan increased core revenue at a low single digit rate off a tough prior-year comparison. Trojan had very strong performance in 2016, achieving high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive year, helped by continued demand in the municipal disinfection end markets in both the U.S. and Western Europe. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter, as the team continued to gain share relative to the market. Strength in both North and Latin America benefited from improved conditions in certain industrial end markets, including mining and steel. It's worth noting that in 2016 we marked ChemTreat's 49th consecutive year of growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's commitment to DBS and their best-in-class commercial execution. So to wrap up. We're very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, capping off a transformative year for Danaher. In 2016 the team delivered double digit earnings growth, meaningful margin expansion, and strong free cash flow. We also executed on a number of strategically significant acquisitions during the year, including Cepheid and Phenomenex. We believe that the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of DBS provides the foundation for enhancing our growth trajectory and delivering long-term outperformance. We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.82 and $0.85. This assumes core revenue growth of approximately 3%, which is modestly impacted by one less selling day year on year in the first quarter. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2017 core revenue growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.
Matthew E. Gugino - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Roxanna, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Morning, Scott.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Dental is kind of a business that seems to come in and out of favor for you guys every couple years and problems here and there and good times, bad times. But I know it's a global business, so it's hard to isolate exactly. But would you always – I mean when you think about fixing it – "fixing it," it's still a pretty darn good business. But is it more of a product fix? A channel fix? A cost fix? I mean how do you – and how is it – how difficult is it? I mean just give us a sense. Because I feel like I've heard this fix Dental speech a few times before in the Danaher history.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. My history with the Dental platform is about I guess 2.5 years old. And as far as favor goes, I've long been in favor, at least in the last 2.5 years, of the Dental platform, largely because I think it has tremendous opportunities. I think it has such fundamental growth drivers on a global basis. And I think our performance over a number of years has not been up to our capabilities. In other words I think we have a tremendous opportunity to improve both the growth trajectory and the margin performance of the platform. So I'm very much – I'm very favorably disposed towards the platform, both from the standpoint of the fundamentals of the market on a global basis as well as the opportunity that it represents. Relative to what we have been doing and will continue to do and the challenges associated with it. I think it started with that approach that I mentioned both in December as well as on this call, about thinking about it as a new acquisition, essentially taking a new approach. You might say a somewhat more radical approach. In other words when we approach a newly acquired business, we tend to not approach it through small, incremental improvements. You look at what we've done at Beckman, you look at what we've most recently done at Pall, and you see much more significant amount of activity around DBS. A much more significant infusion of talent and as a result of that, more significant levels of improvement. You asked about product, channel, cost, et cetera. I would really go back to this comment I made about running the Danaher playbook. It does involve cost. It does involve rationalizing a number of dimensions of the platform that has an impact on the cost structure. It involves rationalizing the manufacturing footprint, the instrumentation and equipment platforms, the brands, even the operating structure from a people perspective. But the playbook then has that cost not all dropping to the bottom line. You've seen good operating performance this year. But it really involves reinvesting some of that back into the business to drive growth. And I think what the team has done so successfully in the last year is both drive that operating margin performance up and reinvest with, as you heard me comment, 5% to 10% increases in R&D and sales and marketing to get the growth engine moving. And so I think it's going to take some time. But I think we're on the right track. Again I think the fundamentals are solid and the room for operating improvements are significant.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good answer. Just a real quick follow-up.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: How do you do M&A when you don't really know the tax rate of what you're buying? Is that something right now you kind of put back on hold till you have more clarity on tax? Or is it not as important as maybe we think?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Well, Scott, given all the various proposals out there, it is a little bit of an unknown. But the two or three sort of leading candidates of a new potential structure based upon the analysis we've done would all suggest it would be neutral to positive to us. So I don't think there's a structure out there at least that's high on the list right now that would be a negative for us. And that would worry me a little bit from an M&A perspective, but I don't think that's the case.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just while – before we go to the next question, Roxanna, I just want to make one other point on the back of Scott's question about the Dental platform. I think if you step back for a second. I know we get a lot of questions about the Dental platform. I think it's important to recognize that the Dental platform does represent about 15% of the corporation. And there are a number of businesses inside of that platform, like our Implant business and our Orthodontics platform that continue to perform quite well. And you've got the other 85% of the platform that from a core growth perspective is well on its way and I think is performing quite well. So I think it's also important to put the Dental platform in context, relative to the scale of it within the corporation.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair point. Thank you, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. Tom, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the areas where you saw an improvement on the industrial side. You talked about Pall picking up low single digit core revenue growth. Can you maybe just talk about what the order book looks like and expectations for 2017? And similarly with Hach, you talked about mid-single digit bookings. So what's the outlook there?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. We were encouraged somewhat by what we saw, I would say in the latter part of the fourth quarter and certainly in December on the industrial side. Pall Industrial clearly being one of those, our first quarter of positive core growth certainly since – in some time and since we've owned the business. So we're particularly encouraged by that. Water Quality, while that's been somewhat challenged from an industrial perspective during the course of the year, we saw some improvement there in the fourth quarter. Our PID business, which it's admittedly not as industrially oriented as perhaps Pall Industrial is, clearly seeing some excellent performance there. And then finally I think our Life Science business, which has some industrial exposure, particularly at Leica Microsystems, to name one example, also showing some improvement. So I think we're not really ready to call an inflection point, Tycho, but I think there are some signs in the order book that I think are encouraging. Relative to expectations in the first quarter, again not calling an inflection point, but I think we would expect some similar performance in the first quarter to what we saw in the fourth quarter, not a dramatic change. The 3% core growth overall that we have dialed in in the first quarter implies a level of consistency there. A little bit of an impact of days that dampen the numbers slightly. But in general I think we would expect some stabilization in the industrial markets that we saw late in the fourth quarter to continue into the first.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then for a follow-up just a clarification on Dental. You mentioned in your comments you thought Dental softness would persist in early 2017. What gives you confidence that things improve in the back half of the year? And is there a distributor work down dynamic? We've heard about that from a number of your peers as well.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Relative to the last part of the question. I think the commentary around sell-out from distribution, and you heard that commentary earlier in the middle part of the year, the third quarter in the year. We saw the impact of that in terms of our sell-in, certainly in the fourth quarter in the more traditional consumables and equipment. I think that's giving the channel some – setting a tone of caution if you will. And so when you have caution that comes from some moderating sell-out, it's going to have some impact there. They're going to do some, what I think is probably some right-sizing of inventory in the channel with an abundance of caution before they start to see sell-out improve. So I think – when we think about the fundamentals of the market, it's hard to see, Tycho, or pinpoint any particular reasons why we wouldn't see the traditional consumables and equipment start to pick up a bit as the year progresses. I couldn't tell you much more than that, other than the fact that we've not seen these types of air pockets if you will persist over a long period of time.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, could you maybe talk about within Pall, you continue to ratch up very good numbers. So how is it looking relative to that original $300 million synergy guide? Where are you on your thinking on that?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: We feel very good about that, Steve. We got off to a fast start and an early start. We got that rate north of the $60 million that we talked about for the first year to more like $100 million. And I think that's really a function of the impact of the team in place, both the legacy Pall team as well as the Danaher team that went in to help out. It's a function of the impact of DBS and the over 300 kaizens that we got after. And so I think we feel great about our opportunities to get to that $300 million target. I think as we look forward and you've heard us say from the very beginning that some of the more challenging tens of millions of dollars in that run rate are going to come in the latter periods as we work on some of the more challenging dimensions of the supply chain, the manufacturing footprint. And so I think as we think about the timeframe, I think the overall timeframe of achieving that kind of rate in the four- to five-year period is still the numbers that we'd hang onto, only given the fact that it's just a little bit more challenging each year to affect those changes in the supply chain and the manufacturing footprint.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: If $100 million was achieved in 2016, what's embedded in your forecast for 2017?
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Our sort of – and we originally planned roughly $60 million a year over that five-year period. We would expect to be in that $60 million plus range this year. So by the end of 2017, we will still be ahead of – we would expect to still be ahead of our original schedule.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the SG&A, how much of that 110 basis points was G&A versus sales increase? Year on year?
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: The G&A was down. Sales and marketing was up overall as a percentage.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Oh and then – you mean in the fourth quarter?
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Yeah. A fair amount of that is noise in Cepheid. But organically, G&A – excluding Cepheid, organically G&A was down and sales and marketing was up as a percent of revenues.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Co. Please go ahead.
Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Chris. No problem.
Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just a first – just a question on Cepheid first. It appears that on a full calendar Q4 basis it grew 15% to 20% year over year in Q4? Is this right? And then can you just provide some commentary on the key drivers to the strong performance in the quarter by test category?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. We did grow in that range during the course of the fourth quarter. So you do have that right. And when we think about the growth of the business, the growth has been very consistent. We continue to see the hospital acquired infection business, which is a large part of the business, continue to perform well and pretty consistently. We continue to see good growth in infectious disease, in sexual health, and in virology. So when you think about the individual product segments of the business, we've seen a good deal of consistency in terms of those growth rates across the four I just mentioned.
Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. On then just on a higher level, could you just provide some updated thoughts on how the Cepheid integration is progressing? And how you are initially leveraging DBS at Cepheid?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. So it's early days obviously. We just closed the transaction in November. We have an outstanding team of people leading the Cepheid business, largely the Cepheid associates, but with the addition of some key Danaher associates as well, which has been consistent with how we've approached organizations newly acquired in the past. The team has quickly embraced a number of the tools of the Danaher Business System. Dan and I were out at Cepheid just a couple of weeks ago, out in Sunnyvale. We had an operating review out there. And we toured the manufacturing facility and met with one of the R&D teams as well. I was incredibly impressed by what I saw on the shop floor, the before and the after impacts of the use of kaizen on the shop floor. Five-day kaizens that involved Danaher teams combined with Cepheid teams that were making improvements on the shop floor. The tools of DBS that impact new product development were clearly on display when I met with the Omni (35:22) team and saw the impact of what they were working on and the kaizen there. So I think the team is off to a very good start. I think they're off to a fast start, given that we're just about two months post the close of the acquisition. So we're very pleased with how things have gotten started, Chris.
Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Ross.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Just focusing in on sort of the Pharma market. Obviously you provided us a bunch of color, but it seemed like results there reasonably strong relative to the trend we've seen. And obviously bioprocess continues to be a standout. As you sort of enter 2017 with all of the sort of noise around drug pricing and maybe some of the headline issues that have happened on the pipeline side, do you see any disruption to that market whatsoever? And I guess can you tease out whether it differs in terms of CapEx versus some of the more consumable items? If there's any differential in growth rates?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Ross. So, Ross, let's maybe just – to answer your question let's take a step back for a second and try to put a context around our position in Pharma. So our pharma exposure is say between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in overall revenue. The largest segment of our exposure, the segment where we're most largely exposed, is Biopharma. And we're seeing high single digit growth in those areas where we're exposed to Biopharma. The largest segment of that is in the production side of Biopharma. So call that $1 billion of that revenue. And that's largely at Pall in Biopharma production, which we expect will continue to be a terrific growth market. That's really driven, as you probably know well, by the growth in Biopharmaceutical, drug production itself. And the pipeline today is a rich pipeline. It's never been bigger than it is it today in terms of the number of drugs that are – the large molecule drugs that are currently in development. And we also see single use technologies in biosimilars being key drivers of growth over time. So we feel very good about that. In terms of drug discovery, so outside of production, call that about $0.5 billion worth of exposure. And that's where SCIEX and Beck LS [Beckman Life Sciences] and Molecular Devices participate. We continue to do well in those businesses; no real slow down. We think we've got some terrific products that are highly differentiated. And so when it comes to large molecule drug discovery, we continue to see again, based on the pipelines and the continued investment in those drugs versus small molecules, that those to be great opportunities. And then finally, we have some positions in small molecule pharma. That would be at SCIEX and in a couple of other places. And there's still some excellent revenue growth there, but probably not as significant as we see on the Biopharma side. So we feel very good about those markets, largely as a function of where Pharma is investing today and is likely to invest consistently in the future. Just going back though for a second to the largest portion of that, that $1 billion dollars or so in Biopharma production at Pall. I think the key thing to recognize is that filtration plays an incredibly valuable role in that bio production process. And yet on a relative basis is a fairly low cost component of that overall production process. So we love businesses where we deliver high quality, high value consumables that are relatively low cost relative to the overall production process or the workflow. And so that creates an incredibly strategically important position for us and one that we think is quite sustainable over time.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: That's super helpful, Tom. And maybe just quickly, Dan, sequentially interest expense ticked down quite a bit, probably more than certainly I and maybe others modeled. Just is this the new base? Or was there something with sort of the mix or favorability in some of the rates you got on financing Cepheid, et cetera? What's the explanation? And then the cadence off of that?
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Part of it is very attractive rates, particularly in Europe where our commercial paper program is essentially 0% right now. In some cases we're actually getting paid for borrowing money in Europe. I think we're thinking about roughly $40 million a quarter going into next year as a run rate.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: I guess I got to go borrow some money in Europe apparently.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: If we're having a tough quarter, we're just going to borrow more.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, Tom. On Videojet I mean you talked about the long track record of core growth there. I mean what is it that Videojet has gotten right so consistently over so many years that other businesses that you have that are in arguably maybe even higher growth end markets haven't been able to consistently translate? What's the gap that you're trying to close there with the other businesses?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Yeah. Shannon, that business and the team that has led that business for a long period of time now has really created what we sometimes refer to at Danaher as a flywheel, a combination of initiatives that continue to build momentum over time and do so on a very consistent and continuous basis. You heard me mention the great core growth and the long track record. It's really those initiatives are a combination of things. It starts with day to day execution using the tools of DBS without question. The Videojet was really the birth place of a number of key tools that we now use throughout Danaher around day to day commercial execution. We call those tools transformative marketing, under a broad heading of transformative marketing. And it really involves outstanding market visibility, tailored messaging, and outstanding communication to targeted end customers and tremendous field sales follow-up, backed up by an exceptional service organization, which as you heard me say is growing double digits. That flywheel of commercial execution is now accelerating based on terrific innovation. The team would tell you today they probably have the most exciting line-ups of new products that they've ever had in their history. Some of those products are already in the market today and just getting commercialized. And you see some of the impact in the recent quarters of core growth. And others are coming. The team would say it's the best line-up in probably 15 years. And they continue to invest, frankly, in some areas where there's still opportunities commercially, like in high growth markets. They've done some acquisitions of distributors recently. They've added feet on the street in a number of markets. And they would quickly say that there's still opportunities to improve growth in a couple of those high growth markets where perhaps they haven't put the playbook to work as consistently as they would have liked. So it truly is a combination of things. It's a tribute to the team. It's a tribute to DBS. And it really is something that we're very proud of.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on the core margin improvement for the year across the company, clearly really strong and above what you would typically target. How much of that do you attribute to a deal like Pall that's getting after some extra margin initially versus more mature pieces of the portfolio that are just beating their plan?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Shannon, it really was an exceptionally strong year and very broad-based in terms of core margin expansion. But Pall was a meaningful contributor. But Diagnostics up 200 basis points for the year, almost 100 basis points at Dental despite a very sort of tepid end market, particularly in the second half. So really good execution. And I think what was most noteworthy this year was the increase in the gross margin side. That was all organic. For the full year it was driven by new products, as Tom alluded to, in the PID side, as an example. Coming up with new products at higher gross margins, really good execution in the factory, really taking advantage of our purchasing leverage. And that 100 basis points of gross margins obviously both fell through to the operating margin side but also let us really step up some R&D and sales and marketing investments across a number of the businesses. So that's a number we watch very carefully and our execution on that was as good as it's been in 2016.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Shannon.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey. Good morning. Hey, just one more quick one on Dental if I could. Could you just provide us a little more color on how to think about Dental margins? How they play out in 2017, as we kind of work through these cross-currents of restructuring actions and associated payback you hope to get from them? And anything to be kind of aware of, first half versus second half, et cetera, as that plays out?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Jeff, for the full year I would expect a kind of similar dynamic that we saw in 2016, which was kind of low single digit or very low single digit organic growth, but still churning out 75 basis points of core margin expansion. It's perhaps a little bit less than that in the first half, because we are sort of continually taking some cost action. You might see a little bit more of that in the first half. But again I think we can kind of cover elsewhere. But I think for the full year, we'd like to see a little bit of pick up on the top line. But even if we don't I think we could replicate what we did in 2016.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. And then I just wonder if you could give us a little more color on China. It sounds like things were better in a few of your businesses. Do you think there's some legitimate kind of economic traction starting to happen there? Or are there comp issues? Just your bigger picture on China right now.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Jeff, we continue to perform very well in China. I think a couple of businesses that I'd highlight would be the – our Dental business that continues to deliver terrific double digit core growth in China. And that's a broad-based growth rate across all the product lines of Dental. We've got a terrific team over there. We continue to invest in feet on the street. And the overall fundamentals of the Dental market in China continue to suggest that's going to be a terrific growth driver for us. Our Diagnostic business has also continued to perform very well there. We're seeing good growth in that business. We have at Beckman Diagnostics for a long period of time. Our Radiometer business continuing to perform well. And Leica Biosystems is now developing products in China for China. So a more localized approach to ensuring that we're hitting the right kind of price points in that market. I think on the flip side, looking at where there's been some challenges, I think where we've had a little bit more industrial exposure in China, there have been some challenges. I think Water Quality, to name one, is an area where we've seen some challenges, given the slowdown in the industrial market. So we're expecting to see a little bit of a pickup there as we come into 2017 across the industrial markets. But that's really been where the softness has been is the more industrial exposure we had, the lower the growth rates in China.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Derik.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Hi, Derik.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: A couple of quick housekeeping questions, then a follow-up. So the housekeeping – and if I missed it I apologize. The FX guidance, what's embedded for FX into Q1 and for your full year guidance? And also the free cash flow guide for fiscal 2017?
Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.: Sure. For the full year what we highlighted in December when the euro was $1.06 – and I think it's $1.07 – is about $0.08 negative year-on-year impact, a little bit less in Q4 and pretty much evenly – the other $0.07 roughly evenly distributed among the first three quarters. And then free cash flow, we don't give out specific guidance. We again ended very strong, full-year conversion. It was a little bit lighter in Q4. That was primarily driven by the timing of some tax payments, including some kind of one-time payments related to separation that we had highlighted when we announced the separation of Fortive that we ended up paying in the fourth quarter. We would expect a very – again very strong free cash flow conversion in 2017. Maybe even a little bit better, because of some of the one-time items we had in 2016.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And more of a – more just a theoretical question. We've been getting this from investors, but I think there's some concern about if the trade issues sort of escalate and we go into some sort of a trade war with China. I guess the question becomes – is like are Diagnostic products and some of things that are so critical into those markets less subject to some of the bans and like that? And do you have any historical precedence in terms of how we could think about potential trade conflicts in some of your products?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Derik, I don't know that any of us here could speak to – sorry – a historical precedent relative to what we might be facing.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: But I think there is an important point. Let me – all kidding aside, our positions in China and let's – I think you were asking maybe a bit about the Diagnostic business.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Our business in China, we have manufacturing in China for China. I just mentioned LBS (50:31) just a minute ago, now designing products, manufacturing products for the Chinese market. We do $2 billion roughly in revenue in China. And so that's really the core of our China business. When we went to China years ago, we went less for the purposes of low-cost manufacturing, more for purposes of being a local player. And I think that's key to our strategy. So I think in that respect, I'm probably a little bit less worried about the impact on us specifically relative to China-related tariffs. Time will tell, obviously.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Derik.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions here.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure, Steve.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: One very broad question and then one more specific question. The very broad question, maybe taking the concept that Derik introduced with the question around China trade, let's think about it more broadly. We're in a period here where not just Danaher, but Danaher's customer base is thinking about an array of different potential policy changes in Washington. Are there areas where you're hearing from your customer base? Any incremental animal spirits or conservatism that we should think about as we consider trends in the business into 2017?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Steve, I think one of the terrific advantages that we have at Danaher in this portfolio is being a multi-industry science and technology portfolio. And what that means is that we don't have any particularly significant exposure to one end market or one customer set in one geography versus – relative to the whole. Specific to your question, I would say no. We have not sensed – I think what you asked about is animal spirits or animal instincts in any way. But I think you ought to use the term conservatism. And I think certainly there probably are some pockets of end markets today where there's probably some conservatism. I think there were a couple pockets of our Diagnostic businesses where we sensed that there could have been a little bit of conservatism in the fourth quarter perhaps, as people were a little bit uncertain about what the future would be of ACA. That's again something that's rather nuanced and somewhat speculative on the end markets' part. But I think there's so much uncertainty in the world today that there must be pockets of conservatism in some places. But we are not hearing anything consistent or at a particularly – at a high-volume level from customers that would diminish our view of the end markets.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then so if I take a step back and look at Diagnostics, which was my follow-up question. If I look at results in the quarter, considering the comp, I look at the Abbott results, I look at the Thermo [Fisher] results, and a couple of the smaller players, it does look like things across the Diagnostics channel in the fourth quarter might have been a little bit lighter. Safe to say your view right now is that that's a function of just a little bit of a pause? And what are we looking for to call any recovery there? Thanks so much.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Sure. You bet, Steve. Again, Steve, there could have been some conservatism due to uncertainty in the market. But we were very pleased with actually our performance in Diagnostics in the quarter, and particularly at Beckman Diagnostics, where we saw some improved performance. We're seeing continued progress in customer retention and new customer win rates. We see continued outstanding performance from Radiometer on a broad basis with high single digit growth rates. And probably the only weak spot that we saw was at Leica Biosystems. However in the case of Leica Biosystems, they had an incredibly strong third quarter. And so a bit of a difficult back-to-back quarter situation and a bit of a challenging comp perhaps. So we feel pretty good about where we sit in Diagnostics and continued good performance. So some conservatism out there? Maybe. Some uncertainty? Without a doubt. But we'll continue to play offense. And we feel pretty good about where we are.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Tom.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, we've covered a lot of ground here. I did want to address, there's a lot of intrigue in the industrials regarding the pending sale of GE Water. And I know you can't be specific, but might there be any particular business that would be coming out of GE Water that might fit with Danaher's Water Quality platform? And then just a related question is one of the issues that GE struggled with is trying to manage both a Membrane business and a Chemical business. In many ways those are diametrically opposed. But you all have done this successfully. So what has been part of your secret sauce in being able to have both those technologies within one platform?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Deane. And you're right, we don't comment on any specific transactions. And yeah, it's certainly public knowledge about what's going on at GE Water. And it's certainly fair to say that we look at and consider everything that might be available. Deane, you've come to know and hopefully love our Water Quality position over a number of years. And so I think you know well, we really have a bias towards high margin, lower ticket instrumentation and consumables. Sort of goes along with what I was talking about earlier when I was talking about the Pall Filtration business, high value products that contribute meaningfully to workflows, particularly regulated workflows, and that's terrific recurring revenue streams. And that means that we're not as favorably disposed towards large infrastructure or lower gross margin businesses that might also bring along lower growth rates. So I think to your question about our success to this point in having different types of businesses in the same platform, I think the key to that, Deane, has been keeping those businesses that are quite different from one another separate and distinct in their organization structures. ChemTreat today exists in the same organization structure as an independent, truly autonomous operating company, as much so as the day we bought it. Our Pall Water business that came along with the overall Pall acquisition by the way has now been moved into Hach, but is set up as a separating – separated business unit from the rest of the business. And so that focus on the end markets with a unique operating structure that's distinct from others in the platform is really key to maintaining the consistency and performance of those businesses. So we like where we are.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's real helpful. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses have served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher’s growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. With that as a backdrop, let’s turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio as each of our four reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. Geographically, the high growth markets led the way driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35% and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. Now, let’s take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60% largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margins increased 180 basis points and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China, while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in healthcare in China, coupled with Beckman’s strong execution, contributed double-digit gains in that region. Beckman’s particle counting characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from collaboration with one of our diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer’s blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This crosspollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our Confocal business. SCIEX posted another quarter of mid single-digit core revenue growth led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high margin business in an attractive mid single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value that’s part of our Life Sciences portfolio. Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall’s market leading solutions are the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers everyday. Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation and the team’s exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we have been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. At the same time, we have been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team’s thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and [indiscernible] has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall’s growth trajectory. Moving now to Diagnostics, both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team’s solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single-digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen, and Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The results can be tremendously impactful, better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded a prestigious Advance Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs’ transformational success. Radiometer achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single-digits in the quarter led by high single-digit growth in North America and expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher’s diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenues increased 3.5% and reported operating margins increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3% driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. Since 2010, we have grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today and we are now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We have evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers’ experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. Let’s turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare’s core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team’s operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel’s new product and innovation engine. Turning to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. Videojet showed solid growth performance delivering mid single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. Core revenue grew low single-digits at Esko led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single-digits with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. Lastly, turning to Water Quality, core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach’s core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. At Trojan, core revenue increased double-digits driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth and bidding activity was up low single-digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. So to wrap up, we are pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we have taken to reshape our portfolio position, it positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team’s focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders well. We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hi, good morning. Good morning, guys.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: You see the pattern that since you hired Gugino, you start putting up these big numbers?
Tom Joyce: He has got a big team supporting him, Scott. We love him, but big team, big team. Broad-based.
Scott Davis: Well, anyways, I am intrigued by, it’s your one year anniversary at Pall and I am intrigued on how does that – have your results matched up with the deal model or kind of specifically, what type of return on capital are you sitting on kind of as you look point in time right now on that deal?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Scott, we are very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those two teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we have made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that’s gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We have seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we are now seeing investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products, not only launched, but commercialized on time and effectively. So, we are off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So, we are a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we will end up on a 4-year, 5-year basis and beyond, I think again we are off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it’s still early days and there is a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start.
Scott Davis: And when – and just taking on Pall, when Pall Industrial comes back and I would love to hear your view on when you think you move into positive territory there, but when Pall Industrial comes back, would you expect outsized operating leverage on a cost out or how would you think about it, I guess, if you are on our shoes?
Tom Joyce: Yes. Well, first of all, I think we have seen – while not the beginnings of growth on the industrial side, I think we haven’t seen – we have not seen another leg down. In other words, we have seen some stability. The industrial side was still down mid single-digits in the quarter, while the Life Science side was up mid single-digits. And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective. When those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you are going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the read through on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don’t know that it necessarily changes a trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We are working on the cost structures, both on the life science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So, I think the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the read through from that growth.
Scott Davis: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Steve Winoker: Thanks and good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Winoker: To echo Scott, I wouldn’t – team is important, but don’t forget Matt in all this. So, listen I want to just start with the actual fourth quarter core growth that you just talked about at about the same as third quarter. Just looking for where you might see signs of acceleration, how you think about that trending into next year? I know if I look at 2015, the third quarter was up year-on-year 3%, the fourth quarter was up only 1.5%. So just wondering, is this conservative in terms of how you are seeing, but to give us some sense of the fourth quarter if you could?
Tom Joyce: Yes, I wouldn’t describe it as conservative, Steve. I do think though there is a number of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I think it starts with how pleased we are with the performance to this point in the third quarter, with all four segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there is some stability in these markets, but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macro-economically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You are reading same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and certainly that we are. There is a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today whether that’s the election uncertainty in the U.S., the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe, the questions around turns in some of the high growth markets or previously known as high growth markets as I sometimes say around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So, it’s hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said we think we have got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now again underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties.
Steve Winoker: And as you think about extending that through next year, what would be the biggest things that would drive you from that 3% level to say something higher, even another 50 basis points? What are the few things we should be looking for?
Tom Joyce: Well, first of all, we have still got plenty of work to do left here in 2016 before we get into 2017. And we will be going through a process here in the fourth quarter around budgets and be in a much better position to give you some specifics when we are together in December. But if you really stand back and you look at us today, I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong foundation, but I think we are encouraged about the continued improvement and performance at Pall with the addition of Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift and then as we mentioned before, we think there is plenty of opportunity for continued improvement in growth in our diagnostics business, in our life science, in number of our life science business as well as in dental. So clearly we could use a little bit of macroeconomic headwind but I think there is – excuse me tailwind but I think we have plenty of opportunities to play offense and make our own way in a good deal of the portfolio.
Dan Comas: And Steve, just to add a few things, one, on a year-to-date basis pause up mid single-digit that’s not been in the core number, as Tom alluded to that’s with no benefit from the industrial side of pause. So even if industrial stabilizes a little bit pause should be a net contributor added to our core growth next year. Our industrial instrumentation business ad hoc has been weak. Our experience that tends to not last very long, I think that would be, we would expect sort of better numbers ad hoc here in the fourth quarter going into next year, so even those two items even before Sepi [ph] had come in, again Sepi [ph] won’t impact our reported core number but will help our pro forma core number in 2017 as well.
Steve Winoker: Okay, that’s helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: And we will go next to the side of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague: Good morning. Could we build a little bit more on your discussion about the outfit [ph] and muni activity, it feels like that has been building for a couple of quarters now and I just wonder if you could give us little bit more color on geographically what’s going on and kind of what the pipeline of business looks here for the next call it 6 to 12 months?
Tom Joyce: And Jeff, specifically on in the muni world?
Jeffrey Sprague: Yes, muni world.
Tom Joyce: Sure, sure. Well I think the brightest spot that we’ve seen in the municipal world around water. Our municipal water business has been a Trojan where we have seen good performance this year, where we have seen double digit growth. In the last quarter, we’ve seen increasing win rates and a reasonable lift in bidding activity. But I wouldn’t say that that bidding activity necessarily suggests that that double digit growth rate is a sustainable one. This is more of a probably a mid single digit type of market. But we have been very encouraged by the performance at Trojan, their competitiveness I think has read through in terms of their win rates and so we are in a reasonable market right now. I think we are winning share. So I think that’s encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective and we are seeing that globally. I think there is a different side of the story though which is on the municipal business in North America the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan. We are seeing low single digit growth in that market right now still a very good market and that continues to be gaining share there but not nearly at the rate that we are seeing some of the infrastructure build out in certain markets.
Jeffrey Sprague: Right. And then just on Phenomenex, I don’t know a lot about the company obviously but interesting that it’s a 100% consumables and I always think about the strength of your consumable business being tied to the inherent strength in your platform and equipment businesses, you know are there other assets like this that you know are kind of tuck-ins. Are these 100% consumable companies under strategic and competitive threat as you know folks like yourself build equipment business and if there is any perspective on how to think about just kind of the dynamics of that company and how you know that the landscape is there?
Tom Joyce: Well, Phenomenex is a great franchise and it is a – virtually a 100% consumables business with great gross margins, gross margins in the 70% neighborhood and mid-20s operating margins but still with opportunities for improvement be it DBS and we are thrilled to be able to acquire this asset. We’ve admired that business for a long time. We were able to acquire it at an attractive valuation and I think for those you’ve asked us about return thresholds in the past, this is clearly a business that we believe we will achieve double digit return on invested capital in less than 5 years and so and that obviously for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business to your point about install base versus consumables where Phenomenex has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and therefore create unique customer value. We’ve had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years and it has been a very successful one but as some of you may recall we are also consumable agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX and so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that install base. Obviously that can be very attractive strategically when you have it but in the particular case of the life science world being able to customize solutions or these unique applications customer challenge is a real competitive advantage.
Jeffrey Sprague: And Tom that doesn’t create a channel conflict for all the other folks they were agnostic with and there are some bleed away on their other business as a result of it?
Tom Joyce: It really doesn’t, Jeff. Again, we have excellent relationships with other partners in the consumables world in life sciences. We had sourced from multiple, I shouldn’t even say sourced, we had – we customized solutions for customers across a number of different consumable suppliers for a long period of time and we expect to maintain those relationships then continue to be focused on what are the specific needs of the customer, the customers today and how do we serve them best.
Jeffrey Sprague: Great, thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: And we will go next to the side of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thanks. Tom, wondering if you can comment on the academic market, you know the NIH data was pretty negative for September I think budget is down about 13%. And I know you called out some softness for Leica Microsystems. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market specifically?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Good morning, Tycho. You know we certainly participate in the academic market in our life science businesses but it’s – we don’t have enormous direct exposure to NIH. If you really looked at the direct exposure across a number of our businesses, we are probably in the $150 million or less with direct exposure to NIH funding. Now there is more than that in terms of indirect funding but I would say that funding issue that you mentioned clearly has had an impact on a broad basis when you talk about a variety of things that are indirectly funded or go through a number of different stages before they ultimately get to a supplier like us. We have seen weakness in that market. We have not seen any particular cause for optimism in the academic market particularly in the U.S. Europe has hung in there in pockets. Japan is weak and certainly continues to be that way. So it’s not an area of strength right now and clearly the NIH funding issues have not been net particularly helpful.
Dan Comas: And Tycho, I would add that we probably saw a little bit more of a bifurcation life science in the quarter meaning that biopharma remain very strong, traditional farm, food and environmental remain solid consistent what we saw in the first half but we did see both academic and sort of industrial markets particularly at Leica weaken in the third quarter.
Tycho Peterson: That’s helpful. And then on Beckman if I kind of go back to your comments last quarter, I think you talked about growing at a market rate, if you look at the results from some of the peers, they are still going little bit faster including in the high single digit range for one of them. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about you know your view of whether you can get Beckman back to maybe a mid single digit growth trajectory?
Tom Joyce: We absolutely believe that we can do that, Tycho. We have made terrific progress thus far. We have seen improvement certainly in our clinical chemistry and our immunoassay business. Our urinalysis business continues to perform very, very well. That business is up double-digits in the third quarter. And I think with the addition of Cepheid in a broader position in molecular diagnostics, particularly with the potential growth that’s available in – at the point of care and potentially ultimately in the physician office lab, we do believe that both the core legacy business of Beckman will improve its growth trajectory over time. With the addition of those higher growth segments that we have acquired will be accretive to that growth profile.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then just one last quick one, can you quantify the biopharma growth from Pall that you saw in the quarter?
Tom Joyce: The life Science businesses overall was up mid single-digits on the quarter and the single use business continues to grow straight at a double-digit rate. And so we continue to see good and consistent performance on the biopharma side.
Tycho Peterson: Right. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Tycho.
Operator: And we will go next to the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Good morning gentlemen. So on Dental, it’s sort of interesting, I mean the macro has been alright, I would guess in the U.S., but it feels like on North American consumables, we are seeing a little bit of choppiness, curious that sort of your thoughts for that. And then conversely, it seems like overall the segment is doing quite well, but its equipment, which I guess doesn’t sort of correspond with the macro question. And then on the implant side, where it seems like you are doing quite well with the Nobel acquisition, so help us kind of make sense of what you are seeing in the segment and how much is market related and how much is better execution on your end and some of the segments that are outperforming?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks Ross. Good morning. We are pleased with how the Dental business, the segment performed in the quarter, up 3%. And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of different areas and you have heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we have made both organizationally and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective and we are seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid single-digits and yes, the consumable business, up more like low single-digits. And really, I think that have to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we are well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You have heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we as the quarter came to a close in September we started to certainly see some of that play through. And I think absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India, but the U.S. much lower and certainly we are seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely it’s a tale of two cities. U.S. also about the equipment, the implant side, Nobel continues to perform very well. They have got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate. And they are executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side where we have been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing. And I think will pay off – that we will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates.
Ross Muken: Great. And maybe just moving back to the capital allocation, you guys have obviously been quite busy and obviously since you have taken over, there has been a distinct bias towards growth, I guess what should we learn about your vision of what Danaher will be over the next 5 years or 10 years based on these assets, you have obviously gotten some real crown jewels within the tools, complex and Phenomenex and Pall and obviously in Cepheid you got a high growth potential, so how should we think about how you are sort of reshaping this portfolio and what the – I am not looking for quantitative, but maybe more qualitatively, how do you think about the evolution of these assets at this point?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were three of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had. Nobel, on the implant and consumable side, as you mentioned Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We have had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn’t trade our portfolio, the four segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental and Applied Solutions for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continued to deploy our free cash flow strategically with a strong bias towards M&A into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near-term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will, as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories. And hopefully, that would be the case certainly on the margin side, if not initially, certainly over time. So I think that’s the game going forward and it’s been the plan over the last couple of years.
Ross Muken: Great. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Ross.
Operator: And we will go next to the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.
Doug Schenkel: Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. My first question is on high growth market trends, in the third quarter, high growth market revenue growth was I think around, I think you said mid single-digits, as you described that there continue to be some headwinds relative to what we have seen at least compared to historical trends, recognizing a lot of this is out of control, I am just wondering if you would speak a little bit about the actions and investments you are taking to better position these markets for better growth in 2017?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Thanks for that question. I think we have – as we look at the high growth markets today, I am not sure we would necessarily say that there was much of a change recently in those markets, we have continued to see strength in China across a number of our businesses, if not all, business in China is up high single-digits. Real strength in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics, some softness in the market and VideoJet, those are businesses where that softness largely comes from equipment than more industrially oriented end markets. And you have heard me mention a number of times, the strength that we have seen in India, which has been very consistent level strength over the last couple of years. And with those two markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investments are going. We are largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near-term. We – what improvement we have seen and it’s been very modest in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we have sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today. Instead, the biggest incremental investments are going into those markets where we are seeing continued strength.
Doug Schenkel: Great, that’s helpful and insightful. Thank you for that. My second question is on Diagnostic core margins, they improved 250 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Yes, there was some nice improvement in the first half of about 210 basis points year-over-year. So, it’s got even better in Q3. Some of this maybe a function of comps, but to the extent it isn’t, could you provide a bit more detail on what’s really driving accelerating improvement and how we should think about sustainability?
Tom Joyce: Well, we are certainly seeing continued improvement in the margin performance at Beckman Diagnostics. Across our Diagnostics portfolio, you have Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, both businesses we have owned for a number of years and have made tremendous progress in enhancing their operating margins. Beckman, obviously a more recent acquisition, but still 5 years ago, we have seen great lift in those operating margins to this point. But as I mentioned, Beckman represents a large business. It still has quite a bit of headroom for margin improvement. And so we have seen at this point, but we think there is more runway ahead.
Doug Schenkel: So really – sorry...
Dan Comas: Yes, Doug, it’s Dan. We did benefit in Q3 with a slightly easier comp despite having said that, again, it was a very strong quarter of core margin expansion. What we are seeing is continued increase in the gross margin side, continued leverage on the G&A side while we are also stepping up R&D and sales and marketing. So, we are seeing the mix you would like to see from a margin perspective where we are getting the expansion, where we are taking part of that and putting that into more growth investments.
Doug Schenkel: That’s great. That’s kind of what I was getting at, is it a continuation of trend which has been good or things actually getting a little bit even better which it kind of sounds like they are. Last one, there is clearly been a lot of questions about what’s going on in different geographies and different end markets and you guys have been great at providing a lot of directional qualitative information to help us out there. I just figured I would ask in case you guys will be willing to whether or not you could just give us core revenue growth by end market and by developed geography in the quarter across all businesses?
Dan Comas: Well, we don’t give quite that level of detail, but we did talk about continued double-digit kind of mid-teens growth in India, high single-digit growth in China. Both the U.S. and Western Europe were up low single-digit. That’s been pretty consistent. I would add as a footnote probably seeing some incremental signs of weakness in Western Europe where our overall numbers in Q3 were pretty comparable to what we had in the first half. Tom alluded to the academic comment seeing a little bit of that industrial weakness in places like Hach, not a big change, but probably on the margin the tone is a little bit cautious in Western Europe. And Japan, we continue to be down low to mid single-digits.
Doug Schenkel: Okay, thank you again.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: We will go next to the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin: Hey, good morning. So, before I ask another geography question, I just wanted to ask a Diagnostics question. So, it’s been – you have closed the Cepheid or you haven’t closed it, but you have announced the Cepheid transaction, you have had a little bit more time to think about it. Any further additional thoughts on where you think you can ultimately get the gross margin on the Cepheid products? That was sort of a topic when we did the call the last time, I just wonder if you have any further thoughts on it?
Tom Joyce: Derik thanks. I don’t know that we have a lot more to offer. During due diligence, we were able to spend a good deal of time with the team and understand the roadmap that they have laid out for gross margin. You have heard a lot of that from the business in terms of the opportunities around improving the cost structure of the cartridge. We think those are – that’s very credible. We think they got solid roadmap for executing on those improvements. And obviously, once we have closed the transaction, we can engage directly with them, we will be bringing the tools of the Danaher Business System that we have used successfully in a number of other businesses to improve gross margins. You just heard Dan commented what we have done at Beckman and we will obviously bring that to bear at Cepheid and I think you will see those improvements come through.
Derik de Bruin: Great. And just one more Western Europe question, are you seeing – is it budget delays that you are seeing or people just canceling orders or people just hesitating on spending? Just a little bit more color on what’s going on in terms of specific trends, if there is anything you can sort of draw from what you are seeing across the businesses?
Tom Joyce: Derik, was that a Europe question, I am sorry?
Derik de Bruin: The Western Europe question, yes.
Tom Joyce: Yes. Much more in terms of delays, event cancellations, we tend to see both at the tendering level as well as at the purchase order level folks hanging back in certain cases, it’s because budgets haven’t been fully approved yet. In other cases, they are just trying to get paperwork through approvals. And normally, that’s a circumstance where because of some levels of austerity folks are just slowing things down.
Derik de Bruin: Great, thanks.
Operator: And our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Nigel.
Dan Comas: Hi, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Yes. So, we covered a lot of ground, so I will keep this relatively quick. But I did want to come back to Dental there is obviously a lot of noise from some of the competitors regarding the U.S. channel. So, I am just wondering given the vocabulary we have seen, the large recovery we have seen core growth rates in dental, how confident are you – you can sustain this level of growth in the sort of the 3% plus bracket?
Tom Joyce: Well, clearly, there is some cause for concern or caution around that given some of the narrative that we heard from the channel during the course of the quarter. We saw some of that in the month of September come through in terms of the order rates on the consumable side. So, I think we feel pretty good about continuing to improve our own execution, particularly on the equipment side, also at Nobel. But I think on the consumables side, we will need to make sure that we are seeing some improvement in the sellout either from a programmatic perspective or just from an overall macroeconomic perspective.
Nigel Coe: Great, okay. And then Diagnostics, we don’t have a great history on the quarterly performance of Diagnostics, but it does feel like last year, we saw maybe an unusually large Q-over-Q step down in margins in 3Q followed by a pretty big pickup in 4Q. Would you expect to see a similar 4Q buildup out of 3Q? And then more broadly on 4Q restructuring across the portfolio, in the past, Danaher had the very heavy restructuring actions in 4Q, I know this year is not going to be anywhere like that, but maybe just comment on how you see 4Q restructuring actions across the portfolio?
Dan Comas: Yes, Nigel. On Diagnostics first, seasonally, Q3 tends to be a little lighter, so that play out again this year, there was big improvement versus Q3 a year ago and we do expect a nice, seasonal pickup in Q4, I would expect margins above where they were a year ago Q4, which was north of 18%. Regarding restructuring, we continue to take actions throughout the year. We don’t really kind of call those out. I would expect our overall restructuring spend to be in the same ballpark as last year, again probably a little bit more evenly distributed through the year.
Nigel Coe: Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: And at this time, we would like to thank everybody for their participation on today’s conference call. Please feel free to disconnect your line at anytime.

Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. On July 2, we successfully completed the spinoff of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier than expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we own Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments, and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations excluding Fortive for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. Now, turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by half a percent while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher remain core revenue was up 3% while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid single digits led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter. Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9% with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were – we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Science & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. Now, let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid single digits led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continue to outperform. High-single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters as recent new product introductions helped drive low-single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included are Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures. Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits, as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry annual meeting. These solutions are geared towards fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low-single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. The Pall team showcased a number of innovations such as acoustic wave separation in our new single-use bioreactor at the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money, while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. Moving now to Diagnostics; core revenues increased low-single digits with double-digit gains in China and India, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low-single digits, driven primarily by strengthened high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience, while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility test in our amino assay business. Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, VERIS, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like MicroScan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation per patients in critical condition. And the TCM5 updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid single digits with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintained positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. Nobel had another good quarter, with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieved at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements help fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow; from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward, highly versatile implant system providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. Turning to product identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive, preventive services, we're able to improve end-user productivity over the course of a printer's lifespan, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every four years in Germany. This is the most important tradeshow in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year including a suite of powerful new software tools to help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production work flows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the Product ID platform in the second half of the year. Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. Hach's on-line water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. At Trojan, high-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial and commodity-oriented end markets. So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow and will continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across four segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental and Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, we're now ready for questions. As a reminder, we just ask you to please keep your questions specific to Danaher and save any Fortive questions for their earnings call next week.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. We will take our first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Tom. So, I just wanted to just fill in the gaps on the FY guide. You said 3% or better for 3Q. Is that the working assumption for 4Q as well? And then, what assumptions are you making in terms of the corporate dis-synergies in the back half of the year? I mean, obviously, there's a corporate line which is unallocated but then there's some corporate absorbed by the segments. I'm just wondering how that impacts margins in the second half of the year. Any color would be helpful.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So Nigel, this is Dan. So, Q3 we're talking about 3% or better core. I think if we – in that zone, in part because we have a little bit of easier comparison in the fourth quarter, core could be a little bit higher than that. Regarding the corporate on a combined basis, we've talked since the beginning and we're still sort of in that zone about $70 million to $80 million of corporate dis-synergies from the two entities, and going forward, corporate will remain in kind of the low $40 million for Danaher.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, does that impact the segment line as well, Dan? Or is it just within that unallocated line? So, I guess what I'm saying is the 2Q, 1Q pro forma segment numbers for new Danaher, is that a good base for the second half of the year?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just on Dental, you gave some details on the moving parts, will work out better in 2Q. But I'm just wondering, given the pretty soft acceleration from 1Q to 2Q, was there any pull forward or pull back from 1Q to 2Q? Was there some channel volatility? Or is this just natural volatility that we will see from time to time?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nigel, we did see some core improvement without a doubt in Dental, 4% core growth in Dental, and a good part of that was clearly around better execution and to some extent, a little bit easier comp. We saw good performance in implants and equipment at mid-single-digit growth. Consumables, more like low single digit. Terrific performance in China continued. You've heard us talked to double-digit growth in China and we saw that continuing. U.S. and EU getting a little bit better and the high-growth markets, still challenging for sure but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter but, in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low-single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So, we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter and we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Tom. Just on the segmentation, the new segmentation front, a couple of questions here. One, why is Pall Industrial stuck in Life Sciences? And then secondly, on Environmental and Applied Solutions, I thought maybe Water Quality and Product ID would be stand-alone. Are they just not big enough yet? Or is there a strategic thought here, number of segments? I mean, how are you thinking about those two?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Relative to Pall, we did think it was important to keep those together in a single segment. Obviously, the Life Science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both in terms of both businesses, both sides of the business reporting into a President at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So, there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time. And see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would've been far smaller segments. So, I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us as we defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility maintained in terms of how we might add to that segment over time.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I suppose sticking on the same M&A or the same theme here on M&A, I know it's bumpy, but you did six last quarter I guess and zero this quarter. Was it – were you busy with separation, things just didn't come together? How's the pipeline looking going forward? What should we kind of expect in terms of momentum or pace on the M&A front?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, it didn't have anything to do with being busy or in any way focused on other things. Acquisition volume kind of ebbs and flows over time and so we think the pipe – we know the pipelines remained quite good. We have active conversations in each one of the platforms, so we feel very good about where we are. We have obviously a terrific balance sheet to work with and I think we'll see good things in the quarters to come.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And you emphasize the multi-industry diversified nature as well as science and technology, but are you as optimistic on the Environmental and Applied Solutions I supposed in Pall Industrial front as you are on the other parts of the business?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are. We continue to have teams that focus as we always have in each one of the operating companies and in each one of the platforms focused on developing funnels, ensuring that we have active cultivations and yes we remain bias towards applying our free cash flow to each one of the businesses across the portfolio.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll hand it off. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Next we will take Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. How are you doing?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Congrats on getting Fortive done. Hey, just maybe a couple of business-related questions, drilling in a little bit. Tom, could you elaborate a little bit what was going on in Environmental core margins in the quarter, why they're under pressure and kind of what the trajectory is looking forward?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, thanks for the question. In general, we feel very good about where those businesses are. I'll speak specifically to the Hach business. We had very good performance in the prior quarter – in the same quarter last year. In addition, we're making some investments from a growth standpoint in those businesses. So, I think we'll continue to see margin expansion from the Water side of the Environmental segment and I think those investments overall are going to pay off in terms of good growth rates in the quarters to come. So, it's not an area of concern for us.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And Jeff, two things to add. One is Gilbarco had better growth than the Water business, so there's a negative mix in there for the segment and we had our best – best segment was Q2 last year was probably 150 basis points, 200 basis points better than any other quarter we had in 2015. So, a little bit of a comp issue as well. But as Tom alluded to, we are investing pretty heavily right now in the Water business organically.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Speaking of investment, maybe just kind of a total new Danaher question but the idea of kind of restructuring, be it quiet or otherwise, is that likely part of the equation here as you progress through the year? And could you give us some idea how to think about that?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, as we, I think, showed last year, we've established a cadence of restructuring that has gone on, you might say quietly but I would say more consistently and appropriately throughout the course of the year. As opportunities have come up, we've taken advantage of those in each of the quarters. And so, we still have opportunities for some level of restructuring in the third and fourth quarter. But in general, we've been more balanced through the course of the year. And I think that has served us well in terms of the operating margin expansion that you've seen over time late last year and this year as well.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then finally, just back to Environmental and Water, specifically in the muni markets. So, we've been kind of hearing for a couple quarters that things are gaining traction; obviously, had a strong quarter at Trojan. Could you speak a little bit to the forward visibility there? What's going on in order activity? Do you have top-line visibility into that business now into 2017?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Jeff, it's probably a little bit early to kind of comment on 2017. The muni strength continues to be broad based, both at Trojan and at the Hach business. And at the Hach business, we're seeing it both in Europe and the U.S. Very consistent and healthy spending there. The offset of that both for Hach and ChemTreat is where we serve the industrial or any commodity-oriented markets. They've been challenging.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Right. Thank you very much.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Just on this emphasis on reinvesting some of the synergy upside at Nobel and at Pall into new products, go-to-market investments. What kind of lag are you expecting from that? I mean, when do you expect that to translate into improving organic growth for those businesses and just what you're seeing?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Shannon, it varies depending on where we direct those funds. I think in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or two. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented toll gates, you could have several quarters to it, at times, even a couple of years before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So, it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman where oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances. And so, those new product investments can take some time, obviously.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then, yeah, maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, in terms of – in diagnostics, you talked about Beckman's growth being driven by high-growth markets. What's going on in the developed markets and then maybe it kind of gets to some of your comments you just made there but maybe fill out what's it going to take to get some better growth in developed markets for Beckman?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Yeah, a little bit slower growth in the developed markets. I mean, in general, the developed markets, from an overall perspective, are slower growth markets to begin with. We've always seen better market growth in the overall in places like China and India and the Middle East. So in general, I think we're tracking closer to the market growth rates than anything else. Still have work to do; there's no question about it. We have improved our retention rates and our competitive win rates, but there's still work to do in terms of both go-to-market as well as new product development. And over time, we do believe those will pay off and better growth rates in the developed markets.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. Tom, just wondering if you can talk about some of the gives and takes, where you're feeling a little bit more constructive by segment in the back half of the year. You talked to the gives and takes on Dental, so maybe you can pass on that. But is Pall Industrial kind of bottoming out here? Could you see some improvement there? Obviously, the academic fund flows may pick up in the back half of the year and that could help SCIEX. So, could you just talk by division where you're feeling a little more constructive for the next couple quarters?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Good morning, Tycho. Thanks for the question. We do think that we're – as you mentioned, we've seen good performance in Dental. Again, not necessarily a straight line but we're very encouraged by the performance we're seeing. In terms of the other businesses across the second half, I think we'll see continuing better performance across the Diagnostic businesses in particular. We're starting see the benefit of a number of the investments across those businesses. I think we'll see continuing good performance from Water Quality. PID has been pretty consistent along the way, so I think we will see that continue. Our Life Science businesses have also performed well particularly SCIEX as well as Beckman Life Science. So, I think we'd see some modest incremental growth there. I would also remind you that we're coming around through some easier comps in the second half as well and so we will get a little bit of benefit from those easier comps really across the entire portfolio.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And since you called out Europe as a source of strength for Life Sciences and Radiometer, are you kind of comfortable with the macro plan in the back half of the year for these markets?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the Brexit situation certainly has created uncertainty around not just the U.K. but across European theater at large. Uncertainty is rarely a good thing for markets in terms of people's willingness to make investments particularly in instrumentation and higher cost instrumentation. So, I think that uncertainty could potentially result in some slowness in the second half but it's very early to tell.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Tycho, we've been (38:43) on Western Europe. We've been consistently in kind of a pretty healthy low-single-digit number across Western Europe. It's been pretty broad-based. It is an area where I think because of some of the uncertainties in the last couple of years, we've probably taken a fair amount of share as we've seen some people kind of pull back in Western Europe over the last couple of years. So, it's been a good market for us and we're also seeing Pall doing quite well in Europe but those are, obviously, not in the core numbers yet.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment question, earlier you touched on the framework a little bit. Can you just remind us where you're comfortable picking up leverage? And maybe, just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of valuation given how much of this space is run?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, Tycho, we've obviously spent the last year in a significant effort on deleveraging. We're in really good shape. We're south of two-and-a-half times at this point. Initially, we're close to four times leverage. So, we're back to a mode of spending our free cash flow plus and we talk about a couple billion of capacity for this year but going into next year, you're back to more $3 billion to $4 billion of capacity per year. And that's not without – that's without really stretching the balance sheet.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: Good morning, gentlemen.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: So I appreciate, I know you gave us already some color on Pall single use and on SCIEX, but I'd love it if you could tease out at all sort of pharma demand based on sort of customer types of sort of separate maybe pharma from biotech or emerging biotech to see if there's any sort of discernible trend you've seen amongst and it's clear Pall, obviously, having pretty strong growth across the board. But I was wondering if any of the end of markets, whether it's generic or CRO, et cetera, you're seeing any change in demand.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ross. SCIEX is probably the best business to think about when you think about your question about pharma versus, say, biotech. SCIEX has exposure to both those end markets and we're seeing good performance, healthy demand and fairly consistent demand from both sides of the house there. I'd have to do some follow-up to get you some detail on anything to do with the generics or the CROs, specifically. But clearly in the aggregate, these markets are doing quite well. Pall, as you mentioned, we've talked about the growth that we're seeing in the Life Science side, specifically around our single use technology product offering, where we're seeing continued double-digit growth rates in that area, and that clearly is associated with the growth in biopharmaceutical specifically in the growth in large molecule drugs.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: I guess what I was getting at is more on the zero charts (41:57), so maybe I'd ask it differently. In terms of just the high-growth markets and it's clear China has been good but outside of China, how would you sort of characterize the rest of the key markets? Obviously, LatAm has kind of been a mixed bag overall, but India and some of the other key geographies.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say China in particular, India as well, are very good markets for us. But I would say that there's still a long runway ahead for those markets. Some of the generic and the CRO movement into those markets has been on balance, a positive, but there are also components of the market that are still relatively nascent, particularly in terms of what might be going on there in the future relative to large molecule drugs. So, I think there's still a pretty good runway ahead.
Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks, Tom.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank, Ross.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Derik.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, could you talk a little bit about capital deployment? I'm just curious now that sort of Fortive has spun out. How do you sort of view your overall strategy in the Life Sciences space? Do you still feel like you want to stay focused on the core – stand-alone core brands or do you feel the need to sort of become a more integrated provider in the space? Do you think you need to add anything to your Life Sciences & Diagnostics armament?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Derek, I think, first of all, starting at a Danaher level, our bias towards M&A is not – and the use of our free cash flow to M&A is not specifically skewed towards any of the four segments that I mentioned. We've had a consistent track record of capital allocation across each of those four segments that we'll be reporting on in the future, and I think you'll continue to see us do that. Now specifically to your question around Life Sciences & Diagnostics, what you've seen us do in Life Sciences is continue to broaden our product offering over time and I think you'll continue to see us do that. We have had a bias and we continue to have a bias towards businesses with not only strong brands and significant installed bases, but installed bases that drive good, consistent recurring revenue and consumables growth. The diagnostic business is inherently that way, typically, and you've seen us buy businesses with those same characteristics; strong brands, significant installed bases and strong recurring revenue and consumable streams. I think you'd see us continue to do that. We think there is certainly room to continue to expand our Diagnostic product offering and provide hospitals with broader bundles of product. Today, we provide products obviously to the central laboratory, the core clinical laboratory as well as anatomical pathology and to the acute care areas of the hospital. And with expansion of MicroScan into microbiology with IRIS opening up urinalysis for us, I think those types of expansions of our footprint would certainly be characteristic of the types of things that we would hope to do in the future
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. It's been over a year since you launched the VERIS platform in molecular. Could you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of installed base and competitive wins and essentially, where is that going? What's the customer type? And then, I assume you're taking share from people because most hospitals have molecular platforms of that size, could you just talk a little bit more and some color on that?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Thanks, Derek. Just for everyone's benefit, the VERIS platform is a high-volume, random-access molecular diagnostics instrument that was commercialized for the first time in Europe in the second half of last year. That product line serves the core or central clinical laboratory of major hospitals. And again, as I mentioned, it's a high-volume platform. We're very pleased with the early traction that we've gotten. It is still early. During the first year of a significant new product introduction like that, the first of its kind by Beckman Coulter, it does take a while to build the funnel, but we've been very happy with how that funnel has built the sales opportunity funnel in the last year. The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have four assays in the market right now, but the four assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant roadmap of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe. But the feedback from customers has been very strongly positive, and we feel good about the start we have.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And when is FDA approval expected? Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I usually hesitate to try to put any bets on FDA clearance. There's a fair amount of work to do, even before we file for that clearance. So, I'll probably have a better sense of that in the quarters to come but I couldn't put a date on it today.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Morning. Just a question on margins, firstly. So, the core margin in total Danaher fell about 30 bps in Q2. Could you give that comparable number for the remaining business and how you think that will trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess going back to the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, the headline margin there was down 300 bps plus in Q2. Should we see that coming back in the second half as the comps on margins get much easier?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Sure, Julian. On the last one, yes. And as I mentioned earlier, part of the Environmental issue was a comp issue that margins, on a historical restated basis for the Environmental and Applied Solutions were 200 basis points higher in Q2 a year ago. So, you expect that to sort of normalize. Core margins were relatively flat for Danaher. Ex Fortive, that was again somewhat of a function of the prior-year compare. For our full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion for Danaher, ex Fortive, and you'll see better performance. So, very good performance in the first quarter. You'll see better performance in Q3 and Q4.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. And then, just on Pall Industrial, you called out the overall organic sales trend year-on-year. Is there any sort of color you'd give there on specific verticals or markets within that? Any changes?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I wouldn't say we've seen necessarily any changes, Julian. I think to the extent that there's good news there, I think it would be that we've seen some stability found in those markets. We continue to make some excellent progress in terms of our go-to-market initiative. We've done over 40 growth-related kaizens at Pall since we acquired the business. And a number of those kaizens have been going on in the industrial markets. And that involves installing DBS tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing that we think is improving our execution in those markets. So, I think the combination of seeing some stability across each one of those end markets in combination with the application of DBS tools, I think has gotten us to a pretty good place. So, I would hope to see some incrementally better performance late this year and certainly entering next year. But I think in general, we're pleased that things have stabilized.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question is coming from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. I just want to ask another question on Pall Industrial. If we look back prior to the acquisition, that business was obviously growing a little slower than the Life Science side. But curious if you could maybe take a bigger step back and give us a sense of what you think it will take for Industrial to return to growth. Is it mostly a function of end markets, or is there really more of an execution issue?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Isaac, good morning and thanks. I think it's both. As I was just mentioning to Julian, I think we've seen the markets themselves from a macro standpoint stabilize a bit; in other words, not get any worse. And we will need to see some improvement in the macro environment to see some meaningful or step function improvement in growth. But we're not waiting for that. Our focus is on ensuring that we have the best sales team on the field, that we're providing those teams with exceptional new product development, that we've got our coverage set up appropriately across geographies and across each one of those verticals. And I think the combination of good market coverage, DBS tools, new product development and some improvement in those end markets is what it's going to take. Obviously, the majority of that we hope to be in our control but a little help from the end market certainly wouldn't hurt.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, that's helpful. And then one other question on Beckman. If we – just trying to square up kind of what we saw last week with some of the peer groups in Diagnostics with what you said. Obviously, you've got VERIS and CytoFLEX helping out. If we pull those out, just trying to get a better sense of how you think you're pacing versus the overall market for Diagnostics. And any color there, especially in North America, would be helpful. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Well, as you know, we had come from behind here from the standpoint of the big five in the overall market. I think from a pacing standpoint, we've now gotten to a point where we are very close to, if not at market growth rates with a couple of the competitors as you mentioned that reported last week posting better growth rates. And in doing so, in some cases, as a function of their positions in certain higher growth markets but, in other cases, we simply have work to do in terms of continuing to drive our new product development and our go-to-market initiatives. We're ahead of a couple other competitors in that market and we have demonstrated where, from a competitive win perspective, we've become far more competitive in the overall market. So, I think we've made a ton of progress but clearly work to do, and that work is, as you've referenced, is represented by some folks that are still putting up some pretty good numbers. So, I think we've got the initiatives and the investment levels in the right place to continue to make progress, and it'll take a bit of time, but I think we're on the right track.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks very much.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Isaac.

Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our start to 2016 as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year on year. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we've continued to build a highly-experienced leadership team, and have named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor and Analyst Event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion and core revenue increased 50 basis points as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and one less selling day. Clearly the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2% while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%. Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High growth markets were up low-single-digits as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well-positioned to compete in several attractive markets, and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin at 16.4%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year. Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed six bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-sized transactions for both companies through the separation process. Now let's take a look at our five operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high-single-digits as we continued to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single-digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hot spots on high voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly. At Tektronix, core revenue declined low-double-digits as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual Tool Expo in Las Vegas. The Expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost three-quarters of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales. Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. The Water Quality's platform's core revenues grew slightly as one less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial and commodity-oriented markets. One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors – long-lasting precision sensors, are a key part of weather measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management. At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high-single-digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point of sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVRs other opportunities at our Investor and Analyst Event next month. Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5% with reported revenues up 42% largely due to our recent Pall and MicroScan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low-single digits led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, IRIS closed in 2012 and extended our foot print beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, IRIS has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of MicroScan expanded Beckman's already-strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been one year since we closed the deal and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both IRIS and MicroScan are helping us serve our customers better and we believe that adjacent acquisitions combined with our consistent application of DBS will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our Diagnostic businesses. In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low-single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low-single-digits as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America. At SCIEX, core revenues grew low-single-digits driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most-critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the X500R, the first model within our X-series product family which was the SCIEX team's largest-ever development project. The X500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, two of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth. Turning to Pall, we are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low-single-digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS including over 100 Kaizen events since close has led to meaningful process improvements and several product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year on year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high growth markets, as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by one less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk. At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities. Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5% while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high-single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. Product Identification core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. Videojet's core revenues increase mid-single-digits driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support. So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We're also off to a great start at Pall where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing two separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Isa, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, Tom and Dan.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: China was a bright spot for you guys, and I know last quarter was – I mean it tracked pretty comparable last quarter as well, but it sounded like things maybe firmed up a little bit. I mean Fluke – is Fluke your canary in the coal mine in China having that business back in positive territory in the quarter? Maybe just a little color on what you guys are seeing there.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. China unquestionably is – remains a very good market for us despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that there's slowing in various areas. We were very pleased with the performance in China, and I think it was relatively broad-based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high-single-digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single-digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just – is an exceptional business overall. We've had a – it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to-market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments of the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets, and in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth. Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics broadly continuing to perform well there. So, again, while clearly the headlines would show that that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, Tom. And then I just wanted to ask where you stand in Pall versus the deal model. Kind of help us now that we're a year in or so, I mean give us a sense of how you – what's working, what's not working, what – Industrial is probably far weaker than you thought it was, but the Environmental, or the I should say, the Life Sciences side is probably far stronger than you thought it would be. So how are you managing that variability? And how does it all really stack up at the end of the day versus what your prior expectations were?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Scott, we're in – it's Dan. We're off to a very good start there. We had mid-single-digit good growth in the quarter. As Tom alluded, that was a combination of double-digit growth in the Life Science side and a slight decline on the Industrial side. Clearly that would have been a contributor to our overall organic growth at Danaher. From a margin perspective, we are ahead of schedule. We've talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix given the Life Science business is more profitable and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter. It'll likely create some opportunities where we'll be able to accelerate some investments here at Pall during this year given we're tracking so well.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. Good luck, guys. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Just to follow on Dan's comment a little bit, the team at Pall has just done a tremendous job. It's, as we've mentioned before, it's a great combination of both some seasoned Danaher leaders as well as an exceptional group of folks who have been at Pall for a long time, who together have really brought DBS to life in that business in rapid fashion. You heard me mention about the 100 Kaizens that have gone on. Those have gone on literally around the world. And it's just one indication of the rapid rate at which the Pall team has adopted the tools of DBS, and really that has truly contributed to not only the growth dynamic that we're seeing, but certainly has assisted in us getting ahead on the cost takeouts on the margin side.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve. Good morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just back to Pall just to follow up on that, I think they were doing a little bit better than $100 million in R&D a year, and R&D year-over-year was up I think about $20 million bucks. Is that a little bit of a decline in the core R&D? Or are you kind of getting efficiencies there on the Pall side? You also mentioned you're kind of walking away from some business there I think in your 10-Q at Pall. Could you just give us a degree of magnitude on that front? And then I have one quick follow-up.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Steve, on the walking away from some business, that's something that Pall had started prior even to our acquisition. It's down to a relatively nominal amount here and we'll be...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think largely done by the middle of this year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then on the R&D front, what was kind of Pall's R&D? I think it was greater than $100 million. Are you guys getting more efficiencies there? Do you expect to maintain that R&D budget, increase it?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would – right now, we're sustaining and I suspect over time that will get increased.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So...
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just add to that, I think we've mentioned this maybe once before, but if you think back to the play book that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the play book here at Pall is very similar, which is there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined. And we're working on those, obviously, to start to see the margins coming up. But the play book is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing in R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marking and R&D on the quarter for Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. So some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just lastly on the free cash flow, a very strong quarter. Obviously, you're paying down some debt, beginning to delever here a little bit. Is there anything about the timing of that free cash flow? Or should we think about kind of normal seasonality off of that base? I know there were some accruals, year-over-year accruals were less of a drag. Maybe there's just some timing. I mean, maybe the bottom line, is what's kind of the annual free cash guide?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, Steve, you know we don't give a specific guide but we're off to a very good start. There was a little bit of timing benefit around some tax payments, but broadly our cash flow was quite strong. As you know, we ended last year with a record number and a very strong second half for free cash flow. We expect that trend to continue. You know, we're not going to be up 40% year-on-year, but we'd expect a very healthy double-digit increase in free cash flow this year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our first quarter last year was...
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And we were a little bit light.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A little lighter last first quarter. So a little bit of benefit there from a comp standpoint.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Cole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Tom, so you mentioned you've seen signs of stability. I think that was in relation to Fluke specifically. But maybe if you could just broaden out the conversation to maybe some of the more cyclical businesses within Industrial Tech, Tektronix. What are you seeing today compared to what you saw back in January?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Our comments about stability were not exclusively associated with Fluke. In fact, I think there's some pockets even around the Fluke business where we've seen stability, but we've also seen still some real headwinds. But I think we have seen stability in some other areas. You asked specifically about on the Industrial Tech side. The Automation businesses, our Sensors & Controls businesses, as we looked at those throughout the course of the quarter, February and March, we saw indications of stability. We saw those order rates kind of firm up a little bit. And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year. You mentioned Tektronix, I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today. And so I think while we're very encouraged by the new product flow at Tektronix and we expect to see those new products drive some improved performance in the back half of the year, tech remains in a pretty challenging environment.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to environmental margins, obviously a lot of noise this quarter. You called out investment spending. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us size that impact. And it seems that this quarter you had a negative mix of consumables versus GVR growth. Is that true and would you expect that to normalize over the balance of the year?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll need you to clarify that last question. I'm not exactly sure what you meant by negative mix relative to GVR growth unless you're talking about Water Quality versus GVR within Environmental. Was that your question?
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Exactly. Yeah. (32:55) GVR to the margin. Yeah.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, absolutely right. Yeah. Thanks, Nigel. You're right on. If you look at Environmental, which as all of you know both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform which has higher margins, and specifically Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there. The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in specifically in our GVR business, and those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect water quality to come up a bit. So, overall, I think there were just a couple unique factors here in the first quarter.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great, Tom. Thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, Tom, you mentioned execution and disciplined spending at Dental with the big margin improvement there. I mean that's a segment that you've always targeted getting to much higher margins over the years, but it's been more of a challenge. I mean is this something of a breakthrough here? Or how should we read the performance and those comments?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you're absolutely right, Shannon. It's been a challenge in the past, and we did set our sights and commit to making a difference there. We have some new leadership in place over the platform. Many of you have met Amir Aghdaei, who has led a number of our businesses over the last several years and some of our more challenging businesses. And he's really put a terrific team together. They've set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control. But similar to the comments I made earlier around the play book, I made reference to the Beckman play book and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental under the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D, because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. We saw some modest improvement there in our core growth in the platform during the quarter, but we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that. We expect it to continue to step up, but some additional investment over time with some of that cost takeout will certainly be a help.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then, Dan, maybe a question for you on tax. Obviously a lot of new tax policies being contemplated and put into place that impact a lot of multinationals. Any, just, thoughts on that in general and potential impacts on Danaher as well as how should we think about kind of the two NewCo tax rates and any differentials there?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Shannon. Yeah, obviously it's something we're spending a lot of time on trying to understand better. I mean our initial read of this is, this is not going to be an impact to us, a material impact to us in the near term. But over time, we could see some rate creep because of it. Now that assumes nothing else happens, and there's no other opportunities, and so sitting here right now, it's not something that worries us a great deal. But it's obviously a potential risk kind of going forward. I don't think there's a big change in how we think about the tax rates of the two entities. We've talked about Fortive likely coming out closer to kind of a high 20%s tax rate. Again, I think as they begin to do some acquisitions, they'll have an opportunity to bring that down, and I would expect that Danaher would be at our current rate or lower. Danaher RemainCo would be at our current rate or lower.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Helpful. Thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, all. Could you maybe just clarify what – you talked about Fortive versus Danaher core growth in China. What was it globally for the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Danaher was up a couple points and Fortive was down one to two points, say 1.5%, I believe.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And, well, I guess everybody, what are you thinking about in terms of, current thinking I should say, on capital structure for the two entities? Where are you still heading for that? I know there have been some private conversations, but don't have a sense for where that is now.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I don't think much has changed versus what we communicated a year ago. We would expect Fortive to come out as an investment-grade company. You know likely they're not going to be an A-rated company, but something in a BBB range where they would be strong investment grade and clearly have a fair amount of latitude to execute M&A.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And if I could just one more. Tom, in terms of the R&D profile, I know you talked a little bit about it before specifically with Pall, but I guess overall for the company, where is – what level of R&D are we talking about for the new Danaher going forward? And do you see an opportunity to accelerate that at all as you think about also accelerating core growth in new Danaher?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Steve. I've said for a long time I've always believed that there is no magic number for a business with the diverse portfolio that we have today. We really look at continuing to invest in R&D to certain levels specifically at an operating company level. And that's obviously relevant for – or relative to what's important to those markets, what's important for our competitiveness, what yields the greatest levels of competitive advantage from an innovation perspective. So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company. Our track record is a great one and it will continue of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D but into sales and marketing as well. And again, we've done that very consistently. I would expect that we will continue to do that. One of our five core values is Innovation Defines Our Future. And we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year. So, again, it will vary in terms of the number that we achieve year-on-year by operating company or even by platform, but using innovation to drive competitiveness is key to our strategy.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. But what was it? I mean, what was it in the quarter at least just for the current or for the new Danaher?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We were over – probably in the same – Steve, we have the dynamic around Pall where a lot of the application expertise they bring to their customers which is a big part of their value add, they include in sales and marketing than R&D. So the fact that you saw R&D as a percent of our overall revenues go down 40, 50 basis points year-on-year, that's entirely driven by the Pall dynamic. But I would say that Danaher is probably in that zone where you've got some higher R&D businesses. But because of the way Pall accounts for their R&D, it probably averages to where Danaher is today, around that 6% range.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Life Science business, just a little bit more color commentary. You called out pharma as sort of a strong end-market it seems like on the SCIEX side. That market's been running hot for a while. I mean, how do you see the trajectory there? And then secondarily on the Pall side, biotech, there's obviously been a lot of concern in the market, particularly with the smaller companies on funding and the like. Have you seen anything in that side of the business, particularly with small to mid-size biotechs in terms of any relevant slowdowns? Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross. Yes – no question the pharma market is an important driver of our growth across the Life Science portfolio. And we have exposure to that growing market across virtually every one of our Life Science businesses. Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and mid-size, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a billion-dollar business today that's oriented towards biopharmaceuticals. And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years along with the newer products in single-use technologies continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today. So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market, and I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall but from our other Life Science businesses that have exposure to that market.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. And maybe just quickly on the capital allocation side. So a lot of equity market volatility to start the year. Private equity has probably been more of a net seller than buyer. I mean how has this sort of impacted asset prices on the private side in terms of what you're looking at? And does it make sellers more apt to maybe approach a process given they saw equity prices up, down, up again, maybe they're afraid they go down again and so they want to take advantage of maybe an opening in the sort of credit markets where larger companies can acquire? I mean I'm just trying to get a feel for kind of how all this volatility has maybe helped you a little bit on the deal front.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean volatility is a net positive for us as a well-capitalized acquirer. Your comment about private equity, it's getting a little better for them, but the leverage markets are still pretty tough. So I think all those factors play to our benefit. Now granted there are other – a number of other well-capitalized corporate players here. But we're happy to sort of compete in this sort of environment where there's a little bit more volatility and uncertainty.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks, Dan.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey. Just a couple. First on SG&A, I guess, Dan, you kind of partially answered it speaking to the Pall R&D. But the SG&A moving up as a percent of sales, is there anything to flag there? And do you expect that sort of upward pressure over the balance of the year?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, if we first just take Pall out of the equation entirely, R&D as a percent of sales was flat year-on-year, but sales and marketing was up 30 basis points, and that was intentional. I mean we've stepped up some investments. We've talked about some of the opportunities in high-growth markets where we see people pulling back, and we see there's some opportunity. I think some of the success Fortive's having in China right now is probably a little bit of an example of that. And Pall brings in a pretty high sales and marketing expense when you kind of layer that in. That probably sustains itself. We see that as an important part of their go-to-market, not only their go-to-market but as I mentioned also sort of part of their R&D as well. So we don't see ourselves sort of cutting back on those investments, if anything given we have had a little bit more strength here earlier in the year, we may step some of that up.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And on tax, you mentioned creep and maybe there could be some offsets. Have you guys looked at this FASB change on stock comp and determined what, if any, benefit you'll have when you choose to adopt that?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We don't think it would be meaningful.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then just finally, the six small deals, were any of those in Fortive? And if so, what?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: One was Fortive. It was an acquisition for Gilbarco.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that's on top of a couple more we did late last year. So in the last four or five months, it's three deals, Jeff.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I'd just like to go back to the 2016 guide and just to clarify, has there been any change to the core revenue outlook for 2% to 3%? And then maybe a bit on the cadence of that through the year and how might that split with Fortive?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Deane, no real change to our view of the full year at 2% to 3%. I think our comments referring to some stabilization that we've seen here in the last couple of months I think suggest – as well as by the way how that was represented in the order rates, not just the sellout but the order rates in the last couple of months, suggest that we still feel pretty good about the 2% to 3%. So I think we're going to stay there.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And how about the expectations for Fortive in the second quarter?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We would expect that Fortive would be in the same zone, maybe a little bit better. Danaher ex-Fortive would be slightly better and that would roll up to be approximately 2% versus 0.5% of core we delivered in the first quarter.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then maybe some clarification on Hach, the softness in the high-growth markets, is there anything specific there? Is it tougher comps? Why might there be some slowing there?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it certainly was a very challenging comp year-on-year. The platform overall I think comped at 10% versus last year, Deane. So it was probably, among the platforms that we have, it was probably the toughest comp perhaps across the entire corporation. So that was certainly challenging. We have seen some delays in some key projects in a couple of the high-growth markets. So that was certainly a factor there. In certain of those high-growth markets, we actually have a little bit more industrial exposure than purely municipal exposure, and that obviously had an impact in those markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, we don't – that business, you know it well, Deane, is just one of our exceptional franchises. And we're confident that business continues to – will continue to grow over time and we'll see that business' core growth rate improve here in the second quarter.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then just last one and still on the topic of Hach. I don't recall ever there being a time where Water Quality has been more front page news in the U.S. with Flint, Michigan. And just what's your expectation about the longer-term implications on water quality, water tests and how is Hach positioned?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, we wish we had an answer today to the infrastructure challenges that lead pipes represent in that situation. It's just terrible to see the challenges that that community has gone through. But I think if we try to look on the bright side from the standpoint of the overall market dynamics, situations like that always turn the spotlight up on the importance of regulatory oversight in municipalities around the country, and frankly, throughout the world. And so, if those regulatory drivers continue to be strengthened, to be pointed at the greatest vulnerabilities in municipal and industrial systems, that, again, while challenging for those communities, ultimately benefits consumers and certainly benefits us. Regulatory drivers have always been a key macro driver for that platform, and they will continue to be so for as long as we can anticipate.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess on the Q, you sort of indicated that you're still on track to pay the $3 billion dividend from Fortive to Danaher. Is there any flexibility around that number if Fortive discovers a good acquisition? How flexible are you there?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, that's something obviously the Board would need to determine depending on obviously the size of the acquisition and what else they have in the pipeline.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: It's fair to assume that there's some flexibility there.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Nothing's set until it's set.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just going back to GVR, the EMV investment and both growth and investment, is it fair to assume that investment is going to be front-end loaded Q1 and Q2 but you might see growth throughout the year? Is that the right way of thinking about it?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. There's clearly some upfront costs. And as Tom alluded, we also had some one-time items in the quarter and that will normalize as we get through the year.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a question on Dental first. The growth rate was lower than I thought, particularly as Nobel should have automatically pushed up the organic growth a little bit and the comp was pretty easy. So I saw you called out Middle East and Africa equipment. But I wouldn't have thought that was a very sizeable piece of the business. So maybe just give a bit more color there.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, our Dental growth overall, Julian, was at a half a percent was basically in line with our expectations, modest improvement from where we've been over the last few quarters. And obviously as we talked just a few minutes ago, we're very pleased with seeing the OMX up at the rate that I talked about earlier. We saw solid low-single-digit growth in consumables and sell-out continues and actually is a fraction better than even our sell-in. So we always look at that sell-out. We have good transparency with our distribution partners, and we're encouraged by that. The Nobel Implant Systems business, mid-single-digit average daily sales growth in the quarter. We were pleased with that. The Ormco business, the orthodontics business continues to do well, and we're continuing to see on a geographic basis as I mentioned the – a couple of the high-growth markets specifically the – our business in China continuing to do well. On the flip side, on the equipment side, we have seen some challenges in Europe actually, and a couple in those high-growth markets where the equipment side has been held back a little bit more significantly. So I think as we annualize over some of those more challenging comps, we'll continue to see that growth improve during the course of this year.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just on Test & Measurement, I wondered obviously that the trends year-on-year are sort of similar Q1 as in Q4. I wondered if there was any specific end market you'd call out that's sort of dragging on the growth now? Obviously, you do have some electronics exposure, for example, in T&M. Or if you thought it was sort of fairly broad-based, the weakness?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's certainly some broad-based weakness, but if I had to call out a couple of the softer spots, it probably would be the end markets where tech is most exposed and then probably secondarily, it would be on the Fluke side probably the U.S. point of sale has been a weaker spot here through the quarter. Those would be the two I'd probably highlight.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And you're expecting those to be little changed in Q2?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are. That's right. There's no indication right now of pick up there. Obviously, we can always be optimistic, but we're not projecting for any improvement there certainly in the second quarter.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Julian.

Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion, and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end Investor Meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure, and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form-10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-size transactions throughout the separation process. In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macroenvironment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%. In a weakening global macroenvironment, the Danaher Business System help protect and expand many of our market-leading positions driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia, and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3% and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points with all five segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014. Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9% while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single-digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in hand-held laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians, and general maintenance customers. At Tektronix, core sales declined high single-digits; declines in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a mixed domain oscilloscope that combines up to six instruments in one unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after three decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development, and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share, and expand margins. Turning now to our Environmental segment; revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. A combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single-digits with strength across the platform. In the U.S., point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2% with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, MicroScan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single-digits with growth in the high-growth markets partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy leading to high single-digit growth across the region. In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our VERIS Molecular Diagnostics System. VERIS' streamlined sample-in, result-out workflow offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money, and thus far customer feedback has been extremely positive. Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND Advanced Staining Instrument. Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that moved Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single-digits with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs. Leica Microsystems' core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Turning now to Dental, segment revenues increased 17% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%. Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw a strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive, and elements free, which all launched in 2014. In dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth, but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition. Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 8.5% while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new product idea adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical, and we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. At Videojet, core revenues were up low single-digits, as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, Remote Service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continue to execute well. Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into two independent publicly-traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04 which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our Annual Investor Event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Leo, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: We'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think – I mean given that it's been about a month since you gave the last guidance in mid-December – the formal guidance, I guess – things seemed to have degraded a bit on the macro side. I mean, what confidence do you have? I mean, now that you've seen I guess most of January, I mean, have things stabilized? I mean, your guidance seems to indicate that you think that was a bit of a blip, I suppose, so just a little color there.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Scott. I think, Scott, what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses, so we're not immune to the slowdown but I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint, but I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR, while we remain cautious in some respects around the macroenvironment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we're playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well. So, I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, the emerging market currencies have degraded a fair amount. I mean, are you able to get local price to offset that? I mean, how do you manage that volatility, specifically, just given the exposures you guys have?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, it's an issue; I'd probably bifurcate the answer. Where we have the aftermarket business, the consumables, the service, we typically able to get price; with equipment and instruments, we're not able to, and we're taking a little bit of a margin hit there. Fortunately, the euro has stabilized so the overall currency impact is not what it was in 2015, but there's a little bit of a negative right now.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good luck. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Nigel.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, so just on the $0.40 from Pall, can you maybe just first of all comment on how Pall is tracking or how it tracked through the quarter? Maybe comment on the Industrial versus Life Sciences sides? And yeah, has the composition of the $0.40 in the plan changed at all in the last couple months?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nigel, we're very, very happy with how we've gotten started with Pall, starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we've put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute, but coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected: continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So, we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on. On the Industrial side, again, what you – what we would've expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house. We've seen that – those businesses impacted far more than obviously on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket, consumables primarily. And so, that's a strong foundation and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company cost, beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from – on the gross margin side as we look to the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, but that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. And then on the balance sheet, you've taken down a lot of – an impressive amount of debt since the acquisition of Pall, I think about $3 billion of debt paydown. Given the bit more challenging macro, is there a change in your bias towards delevering this year?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Nigel, I think we remain in that kind of $2 billion target for M&A this year. We are incrementally encouraged we're able to get some deals done in December, granted they were small, but we actually saw a flurry of deals get done towards the end of the year. Clearly what's going on in the high yield market has made it very difficult for the private equity parties, let alone industrial companies that have a lower credit rating. So, some of the anxiety out here is definitely helping some of the conversations. So, on the margin, we're a little bit more encouraged than we were 60, 90 days ago on the M&A front.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh...
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry, Nigel.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We may have lost Nigel there. Hope I didn't offend you, Nigel.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, we can move to the next question.
Operator: Very good. Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. How's it going?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Steve.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you just maybe talk a little bit more specifically about Pall industrial trends? I mean, what is the organic – what kind of organic are you seeing there and what are you expecting for 2016, a little more precisely?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Steve, for the four months that we owned the business on a constant-currency basis, Pall grew about 4% on a combined basis. Clearly, it would've been accretive to our core growth here. Life Science was up high single-digits; Industrial was down low to mid-single digits. We see that for the near-term, not a bad way to be looking at the business. Certainly, the industrial piece is more challenged but more than making up for it with a very strong growth on the Life Science side.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then, what was Pall's contribution to free cash flow in the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the working capital side where we contributed north of $300 million of cash out of working capital, Pall was a nice piece of it, but maybe 15%. The working capital improvements were very broad-based, really exceptional performance across all the five segments. So, it was a nice contributor, but it was not an overwhelming piece.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then just one last question. What's the restructuring contingency look like in 2016? Is there any change to that as you kind of exited the year at a bit of a weaker rate, or are you in normal day-to-day planning? How extreme are things around some of the more industrial businesses?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, I think one of the things that we learned from 2015 and we're pleased about is that we did a number of things throughout the course of the year from a productivity perspective. And I think particularly in an environment like this, it's important that we stay cognizant of the fact that there may be opportunities that present themselves, some things that we may need to do. So, we're going to keep the teams active at looking for opportunities throughout the course of the year, and we'll take advantage of those as they come up. So, I think we got a lot done in 2015. We got a lot more done in December than we anticipated, probably $20 million north of what we thought in December. So, that's a good thing; sets us up well a little bit more than we would have anticipated. But again, I think it's important that we stay (31:07) cognizant of the environment business-by-business and look for opportunities to take action where good projects present themselves.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. What was the Fortive versus Danaher core growth, if you split it that way, for the quarter?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Looking at Fortive probably being rough down 2% to 3% and Danaher go-forward up 1%, 1.5%. So, I think that's roughly the way it would split.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a couple of things...
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Steve – I'm sorry, Steve. Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to make one other quick point just for clarification on that. It's important to recognize on the Danaher side of the house, that 1% to 1.5%, that side of the house has a higher percentage of consumables and recurring revenue than you do on the Fortive side. And as a result of that, the fewer selling days in the fourth quarter has a little bit greater impact on the Danaher side. So, when you normalize for the days impact on the Danaher side, that's going to be potentially could be 1.5%, 2% maybe even on that side. Again rough numbers, but it has a little bit more of an impact there.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, okay. All right. And then just on a couple of the segments, so I think this was the – it's been at least eleven quarters since I've seen Fluke go negative. So, maybe a little commentary on what's going on in the industrial environment, specifically on Fluke.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then also Life Sciences & Diagnostics, it's the lowest I think I've seen in 14 quarters. So, you went through a lot of detail there, but to what extent are we – should we be concerned about any kind of bleed over from the broader environment into their markets?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Sure. We'll start with Fluke. Fluke clearly impacted by the downshift in the macroenvironment in the quarter, Fluke being one of our more industrially-oriented businesses. I think the macroenvironment, while it had its impact on us on a broad basis, also had an influence on the way our distributors were thinking about inventories during the course of the quarter. So, I think one of the things that – although we don't have all the numbers right now for full transparency on what happened to channel inventory, it's a pretty good hypothesis right now based on some early data we have that would suggest that there was some inventory control that went on in the channel that certainly would've had some impact as well. So, I think those two factors combined, again broad-based macro on sellout and probably some impact on sell-in based on inventory contraction.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the Diagnostics side, Steve, the bigger piece is obviously Diagnostics, that's largely consumables, Diagnostics were up 4% organically for the year. And as you remember, Q1 when we had the extra days, we were up 6%; Q4, when we had the fewer days, we were up 2%. So, actually on a days-adjusted basis, Diagnostics tracked pretty close to that 3% to 4% rate all year including the fourth quarter.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Maybe one other thing to add there is that best we can tell, Steve, we didn't see any year-end budget flush there in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit more of a Life Science-oriented phenomena than a Diagnostic-oriented phenomena. But in some past fourth quarters we've seen the impact of that. We didn't see any of that in the fourth.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good news and bad news on that front has an impact on the fourth quarter. Sometimes that budget flush can drive some inventories out that then create some go-forward weakness as you start the New Year. We're hoping we – and the early numbers coming out here in January look like we're off to a decent start.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's good. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff. Good morning.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Thanks for that color on Fluke. I wanted to ask that question a little bit more broadly. To what extent do you think kind of the more industrially-oriented organic growth rates clearly reflect end demand versus maybe a broader channel liquidation? I don't know if you have any good insight into your other channels or any even anecdotal color there would be helpful.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have much there, Jeff. I know the teams are still out talking to customers and trying to get a better sense of that. One reason for a little bit more insight on Fluke than and less so – Fluke's a little bit more concentrated with some big distributor partners that we can get a little bit more transparency a little bit more quickly. Some of the more automation sensors and control businesses and so on, more fragmented channels and it's just taking us a little longer to get any sense of channel inventories.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And just shifting gears a little bit, any thoughts on how the device tax plays through? Do you see any change in demand there or any change in the way people are pricing competitively, and maybe just size what you think the impact could be to your business this year?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Jeff, when the device tax was first put in place, the impact of that was very fairly modest on us. There's money at stake but overall, not a huge number. So, what comes back in terms of a little bit of a lift to operating margins is also modest. I mean, net-net, it's a good thing for the industry. We didn't see much impact in the market from a pricing standpoint when it all happened – I should say, from a competitive standpoint. We did get some of that back in price over time and probably some competitors did as well, but in terms of real impact to competitive dynamics, I think it's too modest a change, certainly to the scale of our business and maybe to the scale of others to really impact the competitive world.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Jeff, I think we said in 2013 it was about a $0.05 hit. We recovered some of that in price. So, I think it'll be less than a $0.05, but maybe $0.03 benefit here in the year.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: We'll move next to Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe on Dental, can you just give us a little bit more color just sort of on the progress you made throughout the year? It looks like ending the year, you had some of your best results obviously adjusting for the days. And so, as we sort of now rolled Nobel into the sort of core and we think about the margin progression of that business over the year, help us think through kind of the pushes and pulls and how happy you are with the progress made.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I think 2015 was a year of very good progress across the platform. You mentioned Nobel; let me just start with that. We have a tremendous team of folks at Nobel. Largely the leadership team that was in place when we acquired the business, they have really embraced DBS and are off to a terrific start, both in terms of continuing to use DBS tools to drive growth, but also in my comments earlier, some great progress on operating margins. And now, as that goes core to the Dental platform, we'll see some impact of that to the good. On the business that existed prior to 2015, I think again 2015 was a year of a lot of progress. I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We work in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was obviously somewhat of a painful process to go through in the sense of the impact on core growth, but net-net, a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently. So we're pleased that the vast majority of that's behind us. There can always be a little bit of a tail to that of stuff we're still moving out in slower-moving inventories, but again, I think a ton of progress. We've also got a very good leadership team in place in our Dental platform today with some new players in place that I think are doing some wonderful things in terms of driving innovation. It was a very good year of new product introductions and I think we'll see the benefit of that as core growth improves this year. So we know we still have work to do there, but good news is there's opportunities for value creation as we go on here.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. And maybe just quickly a little color more on the M&A pipeline. Can you just give us a sense – I mean there's obviously been a ton of equity market volatility. We've seen obviously a shift in how the private equity folks are also sort of transacting. Just give us a feel for maybe healthcare versus industrial-oriented assets and the like, whether there is more activity at one side of the spectrum versus the other and how sort of the valuation dislocations have been kind of digested by the various groups, because you're obviously doing smaller things at this point and it's obviously the large end of the market that's probably been most impacted.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, I'll let Dan comment in a second on kind of the environment that we're seeing. But if you just look at what we did in the fourth quarter, which I think is a bit instructive, we got four or five small deals done in the fourth quarter. And by the way, a couple – two or three of those deals were Fortive-related. I mentioned Pacific Laser Systems in my earlier comment, but there were a couple other smaller situations that we were able to complete during the quarter for Fortive's benefit, along with a couple on the Danaher side. So, I think the fourth quarter was indicative perhaps of some things opening up a bit. I think the environment is generally a favorable one for businesses like ours with a balance sheet that's ready to deploy into small and midsized situations. And I think to your question, there are some folks who are perhaps a bit more on the sidelines right now than in previous days.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. So Test & Measurement and Industrial Tech are both generating pretty good core margin expansion here despite these mid-single-digit declines. Can you give a little more color on how they're managing to do that? I mean, both of them have pretty good leverage in the models so that's a lot to offset. And what's going on in those businesses and can they continue?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Shannon, it is a real testament to those businesses given the challenging environment they're in from a core growth perspective that they are getting the operating margin lift that they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use not just in newly-acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done. If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation sensors and controls areas. Those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools in areas of SG&A, they're just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher. So it's kudos to those guys and they continue to get her done.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then you talked a little bit about the diagnostic comps and things, but Radiometer, that's been one that seemed like it was just going to grow to the sky forever in the equipment business.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Was a little weaker there. So maybe a little – just color, anything there to be concerned about.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. Radiometer is a tremendous business with a long track record of high single-digit growth at Danaher. I'm sure Matt or Dan can find how many quarters it's been, but it's quite a number of them in a row that we've been high single-digits and taking share. It's a high consumables business. It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the instrumentation side, a couple of big orders that had some impact there. So, I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been. No meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there, so we still feel very good about it. I think there was anything there, Shannon, that wouldn't be unique to Radiometer it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East. And so, even our best businesses are probably going to feel a little bit the impact there.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shannon.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Just back on the Dental business, Dan, any chance you could give us the impact of the fewer days on core growth overall and how should we think about margin expansion for the year?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, it has less of an impact on equipment. We were up slightly in the quarter. It's the first time we've been up, albeit modestly, but it impacts consumables probably up, and as Tom alluded, to probably 1.5 points, 2 points when it comes to consumables. Good progress on the margin side granted we had a pretty weak performance a year ago, so part of it was a comp. But we've also took part of our incremental restructuring here in Q4 with the Dental, so we should see some continued margin expansion coming out of Dental hopefully with a little better growth than what we've seen here in 2015.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: That's all I got. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brandon.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Just a question around Western Europe. I think I heard you say that sales were down slightly in Q4, having been up sort of around a mid-single-digit pace in the nine-month period. I think a lot of other companies have sort of been saying Europe's okay. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there, specific countries or segments that slowed down.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Julian. I mean I think that was one of the areas versus what we expected at the beginning of the quarter that surprised us a little bit to the downside. It wasn't dramatic. Clearly, our consumables businesses over there were impacted by the selling days and maybe we were not as well calibrated as we should've been. But having gone through all – most of the business here's – in the first couple of weeks here, the tone in Europe is still decent and it doesn't feel like the step-down that our numbers in Q4 would suggest. And we think we'll get back to sort of modest growth here pretty quickly in 2016. Watching that carefully because it probably caught us a little bit by surprise here in the fourth quarter, but again, the tone still seems pretty good.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you. And you laid out the overall EPS seasonality through the year about just over a month ago. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Pall seasonality of that $0.40, particularly given the industrial organic sales trend in that business right now and how you would contrast that $0.40 impact versus overall Danaher.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, the $0.40 should ramp during the year as we go after costs. Again, we were able to get some more things done in December, and that was inclusive of Pall as well, so we're getting it out of the gate a little bit faster in Q1 from a margin perspective. I think the offset, as you suggest, is the industrial side. So I think we'll get nice accretion here in Q1, but it'll clearly ramp through the year.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Julian.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Obviously good performance in margin in the quarter. Are raw materials – lower raw material costs helping at all with price cost? Did price cost – was it stable in 4Q versus 3Q? Did it improve? I know you mentioned covering FX, but are raw materials helping at all?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I don't have any great analysis on that yet. Given our gross margin, raw materials tend to be less of a factor for us than a lot of other companies you might cover. We are continuing to get price, still getting 60 basis points, 70 basis points, and it's hard not to think raw materials are helping us a little bit, but for us, it's really on the margin.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then how do you get visibility into what to forecast, for example, in the Middle East? I mean, the region looks like it inflected down a bit in 4Q. And with oil's recent leg down, how difficult is it to get visibility? And what do you forecast for 2016?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Andrew, there's a couple of different ways to come at that in the Middle East. One is simply conversations with distribution partners and a lot of what we do in the Middle East does involve some form of a distributor partner, and making sure that we have transparency as much as we possibly can into the opportunity funnels that those distributors are seeing, as well as making sure that the conversations we're having with our own sales team around those funnels as they roll up to our leadership team are as well pressure tested as possible. The key thing about markets like the Middle East is, particularly in businesses like ours, you have a fairly high level of project or tender-related business and – at least on the equipment side. And so, really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or two years ago when the reality is things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace. So being diligent about how we pressure test those funnels is key.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So it's fair to say you're being pretty conservative with the Middle East forecast.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're trying to be increasingly conservative as we see how government funding is being influenced. I think it was interesting watching the course of the year. Oil continued to drop, as you know, throughout the course of the year and yet we actually saw our Middle East numbers hang in there reasonably well throughout the middle part of the year and it wasn't until the latter part of the year that we saw a more acute shift in the Middle East. And so there was a little bit of a lag there and it's taken a bit of time for the team to fully recalibrate.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Tom.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick question on R&D spending overall came in lighter year-over-year and versus our estimates. Did you throttle back on any spending or is that just timing of some of the projects?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. As you probably saw in the numbers that we put out, Deane, we're showing R&D down about 20 basis points, but the reality is, is that that was primarily influenced by Pall. And R&D spending normalized for the Pall influence was actually up on the quarter. So we're continuing to make sure that innovation is a key priority for the businesses and that R&D spending is maintained to the greatest extent possible for the opportunities that we think have the greatest impact in the next year or two.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then just last question from me is the incremental restructuring done in December, did you say what portion of that was Danaher versus Fortive?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was roughly the split you'd expect, 70%/30%. And that 70% is Danaher inclusive of Pall.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: And I'd be happy to turn the program back over to our hosts.

Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We are pleased with our team's execution which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives led to mid single digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco. We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016. So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5% while currency translation was a 7% headwind. Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels but still grew mid single digits in the quarter. Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points. Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter. We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced nine acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first nine months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong and we expect to focus our activity on small and mid-sized transactions throughout the separation process. In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand to Danaher and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies. So now turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits as strength in our Biomedical and Calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America. Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continued to lead the market as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX, this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems. Moving to Environmental, revenue increased 1% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platforms core revenue increased mid single digits with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business, and drive customer loyalty. At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before. ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies, in spite of the challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions Aguasin and Lipesa. Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root, GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single digit revenue growth as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double digit sales in order growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulations to drive demand at GVR for the next several years. Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales were up 14.5% while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth. Our Diagnostic platform delivered low single digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer up time, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care. At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%. Leica Biosystems increased at a low single digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business. This August, we celebrated Leica's 10-year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly eight times the operating profit it had in 2005. Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid single digit rate. High single digit growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high growth markets. SCIEX core sales grew mid single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and Triple Quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of the 6500+ series, offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500+ helped researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies, and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations. Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly, as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development, and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in three configurations which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs. Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%. Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results. Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid single digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive this success, and during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th Clinician [NobelClinician] customer. Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses. During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step, sonic-activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth. Turning to Industrial Technologies, sales decreased 6.5% while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%. Our automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending. Product identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products. which grew mid single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region. Videojet grew mid single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions, and expanded control options for critical coding applications. So, in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macro environment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with our team's steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by four fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Eric, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning, guys.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Nigel.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to pick up on some of the guidance, Tom. It seems that September was weaker than the rest of the quarter, just maybe comment on that. And the 2% core growth as we enter 4Q shouldn't be a surprise, given the selling days pressure, but given the weaker September, is there a risk it could be a bit weaker than 2%?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel, good morning. Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. There's some pockets regionally where we've seen some of that slowing, clearly, and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we've seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally, the portfolio is very well positioned, it clearly differentiates us. And generally we think, when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there, and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trend lines, but our bias is to build on our strengths and despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis, anyway, with what we've seen here in the late going in September.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's great. And then just as a follow-on, we're seeing some of your competitors have stepped up restructuring as we enter 2016. Are we still on plan with the original guidance for restructuring or do you see the potential for maybe an uptick in 4Q?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Back in December, we laid out sort of the view of the year, and I think what's a little bit different this year is that – and in line with that guidance, by the way, we've done some things along the way. We haven't simply sat back and taken stock of things here in the fourth quarter, but instead, I think we've been better at having each of our businesses look for opportunities along the way. So we've seen some activity going on throughout each of the quarters of the year. And while as we go through the fourth quarter, we may do a little bit more than we initially anticipated. Those plans are sort of still in the works here. But we think overall, that plan will be pretty consistent, maybe a little bit higher. Obviously, there'll be some Pall contributions to that activity. But generally, we think that will set us up pretty well for 2016.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, Tom, that's great. Thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nigel, appreciate the questions.
Operator: And the next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Could we get a little more color on Pall and, in particular, what you're seeing in the Industrial businesses there as well as the Life Sciences? And then just also what are the kind of financial moving parts as far as profit contribution in the fourth quarter and then to the extent that you're either investing that away with restructuring or letting that drop to the bottom line?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, thanks, Steve. First of all, we're really pleased that we got the Pall closing done as we did. Terrific teamwork, I think, on the part of the Pall team as well as the Danaher team to get that done sooner than anticipated. We're off to a very good start. We have Rainer Blair, who many of you know from our Life Science business, in the leadership position over the business right now. We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives. Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectations. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again, probably to be expected, given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so, given those vertical markets. Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall, but obviously that will, in fact, be offset to some extent by any of the cost actions that we'll take and the investments that we'll make.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So you're investing that away. And what was the core for Industrial in the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: They were all up. Pall with mid single digits, with Life Science high single to double, and Industrial slightly negative.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last question. How was September for you guys?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: September was up about 2%, Steve. We thought it would closer to 3% and that kind of cost us 0.5 point overall in the quarter.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right, thanks a lot.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on Dental? And when you think about like – I can't do the math because I don't have the data, but if Nobel Biocare was up so well then the core underlying business must have been down pretty meaningfully. And you said consumables were strong, so basically means that dentists have stopped buying equipment. So I don't know this business well enough to know whether you get some strange buying patterns there or not, but can you give us a little bit of color on what are your sales guys telling you? Why are dentists not buying right now?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Scott, one point of clarification, in our core number, we are not including Nobel yet.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, okay.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So on an adjusted basis, we would have been up low single digits, but I'll still let Tom – the question on why we were down slightly.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Dan. Your question still has merit, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That makes me feel better.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, but let's go a little deeper outside. First of all, on Nobel, just a quickie. We're really happy with what's going on there. The team has done an excellent job. Average daily sales rates continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence, great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and team's doing well. But onto the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumables side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we had talked about throughout the course of this year, on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sell-out, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sell-out data. I'd contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side it's the inventory rightsizing in the channel that's taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly in the high growth markets, where it's a little bit more project-oriented. Now, the key thing that we look at, though, when we look through those numbers is we look at the sell-out numbers. And the sell-out numbers are – on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly, so we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and, again, a little high-growth market headwind.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I had an interesting meeting with a financial sponsor yesterday who just commented that they thought the IPO option was dissipating pretty fast and that they wanted to derisk their portfolio pretty quickly, and this was a fairly large sponsor. It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small and middish stuff. Is there a scenario where you would stretch the balance sheet and/or even tap equity markets if you felt like it was the right transaction, just given the dynamics out there?
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think your question's framed in the right way, Scott. For the right strategic transaction, for the transaction, for the asset, the business that really strengthens us strategically that adds a level of competitive advantage, that provides a greater level of growth rate on a long-term basis, we would do the right thing from the standpoint of whether that's going into the markets, as we did so effectively to finance the Pall transaction, or set up the balance sheet in a way that would allow us to do that. So my comments should not mean to suggest that there's a bright line that's snapped at a certain point beyond which we wouldn't go. So it's all about the strategic value that can be created.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. Good answer. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve, good morning.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hey, just first on the separation timing, I know you've obviously been very busy, you got Pall done early, what are the key hurdles to having that separation happen earlier? Is there a desire to do that earlier anyway? How are you thinking about that at this point?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Steve, two of the bigger drivers are filing with the IRS and getting a favorable ruling on key points and then, two, filing the Form 10 with the SEC and getting through that process. We're working diligently. I think there is a good chance, prior to the investor meeting, we'll have a better sense on whether or not we'll be able to try to pull this thing forward from our end of the year kind of current timeline.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then secondly, just perhaps a minor point, but maybe help us understand to what extent in all the major currency headwinds that you've called out, how much of the margin impact is really transactional in terms of maybe mismatched price and cost base? Help us maybe just understand how you're thinking about that in the quarter.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. I mean try to think through kind of a high-level example. So if you take – we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth markets, not all of that's in local currency, but most of it – call it $1 billion of it in local currency, that's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan Index, which is they track the top 10 emerging market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter, from the beginning of July to the end of September. So call that a weighted average of a 5% decline. So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenues, that's $50 million of revenues that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency, so you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, fantastic, very helpful. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. Just a question on some of the other companies in the group, they sort of break out price, raw materials price, raw materials impact on margins year-to-date, and obviously it's been a decent tailwind I think for pretty much every company. Is there any color you could provide in the nine-month period, let's say, not just the quarter on how much of a benefit price raw material has been?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Julian, it's clearly been a slight benefit. We continue to get about 60 basis points, 70 basis points of price largely in our consumables business. But commodities – given our gross margin profile, commodities do not play a big impact on our cost of goods sold. The one area where I would have thought we would have actually gotten more of a benefit than we have is actually on the logistics side. Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices. Now, again, I think as demand gets a little weaker here, maybe that helps. So it's been a benefit to date. But just given our product make-up, it's not been – the commodity side doesn't help or hurt us as much as most industrial companies.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you, and then just a question on China. Obviously, the last month or two, people are trying to see if there's any evidence of a bottoming-out in short-term demand there. Maybe just talk about how you have seen demand in the different verticals in the last three months or four months.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Julian, we've actually seen China, while slowing incrementally, it's still one of the better markets where we play today. Our growth rates continue to be very good in a number of our businesses. Specifically in our Diagnostic business, we continue to grow extremely well in China. We've seen some of the – some of the slowing that we had talked about around tenders for Life Science over a period of time, that money has freed up. Not perhaps to the same rate that we would have hoped by this point, but certainly, we're seeing a better environment for life science spending. Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So, clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be, but our Environmental businesses, our Life Science Diagnostic businesses are well positioned and we still feel very good about those. I think that's probably a market, as an example, where we really plan to and my bias is to continue to play offense. We'll be selective about where those investments go and target them to the higher growth segments, but in general, we're still constructive in that market.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe a little bit more color on the pharma vertical as a whole would be helpful. I know you talked to Pall in the quarter obviously. There's been a number of sort of volatile events in the space, on drug pricing, et cetera and we've obviously seen a bit of a collapse in some biotech prices. And so help us understand, I mean, it seems like SCIEX had a pretty good quarter and obviously the biotech side of Pall did as well. So help us think through the market volatility and whether or not that sort of worries you at all relative to the demand side of things.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ross. We continue to be bullish on those markets. Yes, obviously there's been some volatility, certainly, in those markets, certainly in terms of the way they've been trading. And of course, our exposure, as you mentioned, is largely in the Pall business as well as across our Life Science platform, and more specifically around AB SCIEX. Specifically, our pharma exposure in Life Sciences is about probably 20% or 25% of that business specifically goes into that market. In the case of Pall, specifically it's about a third of their business is bio pharma-related. The growth rates there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products. On the research side, the research investments, while they're shifting around a bit, continue to be relatively good. So I think in general, we're staying the course there and we think there's still great opportunities ahead.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: And maybe just dovetailing off of Steve's question from earlier, it's been an environment that's been difficult for you from an M&A standpoint last few years, but we're finally getting to a period where there's a little more volatility, if valuation has come down in some subsectors, seems like the timing may be fortuitous given when you can complete the spin next year. Maybe remind us around your activity level on tuck-ins during the last kind of market dislocation in 2008-2009 and talk a little about the trade-off of kind of completing the spin in due course versus the desire to sort of continue to add on at least more of the tuck-ins versus maybe anything larger.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I hope we're not looking at 2008-2009.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: No, obviously.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: During – obviously, that was a good period for us in that 2008-2009 period, we acquired almost – brought in almost 20 companies and not surprisingly, those are among our best returns for the company. I don't think we're heading into that, but the environment's getting tougher. We talked earlier about the IPO market being tough here and I think that bodes well, I think that bodes quite well for NewCo, given the choppiness in the industrial sector, given a little less competition from private equity. We've talked about roughly 2 billion of capacity the rest of this year and into next year. But as we get towards the end of – middle, end of next year, that number's going to jump back up a lot. So we're not – Tom suggested we're not shutting down, we're still working hard looking at activities, looking at possibilities both for Danaher and at NewCo.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Had a couple quick comments or questions on the Water Quality side of the business and maybe you can give a frame for us how you're seeing municipal budgets today. Everything I'm reading, it looks as though muni budgets are actually one of the growth markets at least for North America. So how are muni budgets favoring projects for Trojan, for example? And then a second question on Pall, it's interesting that Pall, as you expect, you see the logo in the Life Sciences side, but it could have easily also showed up today in the Environmental logos, and be interested in how you're positioning Pall in go-to-market in Water Quality.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane. So specific to municipal budgets and the overall municipal water market as a growth market, it's interesting, right, because we could talk about it as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis, but today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last three years or four years where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S, today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last three years or four years. So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to – certainly to Hach Lange as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year and we've seen overall revenue converting that business – that bidding activity into revenue up this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today and clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality. In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is – it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have a team at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology where bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatment together may be a great opportunity for a customer. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100-day strategic plans across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with and we'll see what we can do.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, and just a quick question. What was NewCo's core revenues in the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Deane, they were a little bit under the 3%. So they were 2%, 2.5% led by both Gilbarco and Matco.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great, thank you.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys, good morning.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question on free cash conversion. what are the buckets for improvement in the fourth quarter? And also if you could give us an initial sense given that we've closed Pall, how much working capital contribution can we get in 2016?
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Andrew, I don't know if we're looking at a very different dynamic in Q4 of this year versus last year. We did see a spike in payables at the end of the third quarter. That sometimes happens when we have a quarter end that's in the following month. So we actually closed a quarter in October as opposed to September 29, September 30. That should normalize back in the quarter. We tend to have pretty good working capital performance as we get towards the end of the year. That should be another contributor. So I don't think – I don't see a very different frame than what we had last year. We're still working through the Pall numbers. We think there's some meaningful cash flow opportunities there, not only in the working capital side but also on the CapEx – managing CapEx a little differently there, but we'll talk about both of those more in time.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just a follow-up on separation timing. Did you change your disclosure language on the timing? Because the QNO (45:28) says in 2016, or is it the same language as before? Just to confirm, sorry.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I don't remember. What I'm continuing to say is our expectation is 2016, we still believe it will be the end of the year but that could change, and if there is a change, it would be to the positive and we'll know more here in a couple months.
Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: And the next question's from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys, thank you. Just a question on Beckman to start. If I just take a quick look at peers here like Abbott and Roche, some of them do seem to have core growth rates closer to the high single digit range. And so I'm curious, sort of, if I look back at my notes, you guys had an analyst meeting earlier this year and gave a lot of disclosure on the things you've done to turn around the franchise, but curious kind of what you need to do from here to kind of pace ahead of your comps there.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Isaac, thanks. We're continuing to make progress at Beckman. We track our customer retention and we track our win rates very closely on a month-to-month basis. We're confident as we look at the combination of retention and win rates that we're adding to our growth position as we look out into 2016 and 2017. Obviously, some of what we see in retention and adding menu to retained accounts as well as new customer accounts don't necessarily manifest themselves in the quarter in which you've won them. In fact, oftentimes, it may take six months to 12 months for those to materialize. So I think we're confident we're continuing to make progress, strengthening the portfolio through new products, continuing to see good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's a journey, we still have work to do. We're not yet at the growth rates that we would like to see relative to the peer group. You highlight them well. And – but we are making progress and we're confident in the opportunities.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then maybe just a question on NewCo. Where are you in the process of sort of leadership selection and when might we know a little bit more about kind of how you're going to staff up the NewCo? Thank you.
Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we've publicly named Jim, obviously as the leader, but his entire L1 team with one exception has been named. They're all internal folks. And a fair number of people at the L2 level, the level below that, have also been named. So we're off to a good start on that front.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks so much, guys.
Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Isaac.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.

Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher business system to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and are intent to separate Danaher into two independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these two big announcements. First on Pall. The transaction's progressing well. We've received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments, and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created two strategically focused, independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead. With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5% while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe, and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. Second-quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments help drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others. Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 137%. We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also five bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and mid-sized transactions. Turning now to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits. During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect Asset System to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical, and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads. Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter. Core revenue in our communications platform decreased at a low-single-digit rate. Demand for our securities solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1. Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a nine-month process in which we brought together two complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET, and Tek Comms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout. Moving now to Environmental, revenue increased 2% with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our water quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based with growth across most major product lines. In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation. Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments. At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America with the acquisition of Lipesa Group, a leading provider of industrial water and process treatment solutions in Columbia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia where we had a significant project roll out last year. In the U.S., future EMB compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point of sales solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years. Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high growth markets remained strong with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East. In Europe, we launched our VERIS molecular diagnostic system along with four viral load assays. The streamlined design of the VERIS system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease of use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only four steps, thus requiring minimal training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over two times faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods. Those of you who attended our analyst day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past four years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery, and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth including the acquisitions of IRIS and MicroScan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall, and believe we'll be able to run a similar play book at Pall in the coming years. Turning to Radiometer, Radiometer's core revenue increased high-single-digits with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points. Leica Biosystem sales increased at a high-single-digit rate with balanced growth across both developed and high growth markets. Advanced Staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position. Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our life science platform core revenue increased at a low single digit rate led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset or partially offset by a decline in Latin America. SCIEX core sales grew mid-single-digits driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the ExionLC high performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the bio pharma research workflow enabling researchers to expand their skill sets and improve their productivity. Leica Microsystems' core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina Turning to Dental, core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring. Growth in dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we're encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter. We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's international dental show in Germany. KaVo's updated master series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance. Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points. Our automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe. Core revenues for product identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business. Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth is better across the U.S., Europe and China. ESKO core sales improved high-single-digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%. X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high-single-digit growth. So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our team's outstanding execution using the Danaher business system helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macro environment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come. We're initiating third-quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We're also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.33. As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full-year 2015 guidance would represent high-single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth.
Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lynette, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take your first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Steve.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I would say this is not that exciting, which is actually pretty good in the context of this environment. Boring is good.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: There's a compliment for you.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's the best I'm going do.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: When – the Pall deal, you've got some approvals in tow now. Any chance you can close this thing a little bit earlier than expected?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Steve, its Dan. Clearly we're happy with how we're progressing in terms of the various approvals, but again we don't know until we get the last one in. But, there is a decent chance this happens sooner this year.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But until we get the last one, it's hard to forecast.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. And then in the second half of the year, the environment is obviously pretty challenging; 3.5% core growth is good. Any views on getting ahead of further weakness in any restructuring in the second half of the year? I assume the gain you're going to take, that's going to be in disc op, so it's not like that'll be used to offset anything, but what are your views on restructuring in the context of the current environment?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Steve, we're constantly challenging our teams throughout the course of the year to be looking for opportunities to improve productivity, to position themselves better, to realign cost structures, to align those cost structures to the best growth opportunities. And that's really been going on throughout the course of this year. Obviously as we do assess the macro environment, we'll figure out whether anything more significant needs to be done. But I think at the moment the teams are doing a nice job continuing to look for opportunities as the year progresses.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And is there anything lastly that gets, fundamentally within the businesses, gets materially better or worse in the second half? Anything moving around from an organic perspective?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think probably one I'd highlight for you, Steve, there are probably a few others that I wouldn't bring immediately to mind but maybe a headline would be GVR. As we see the EMV regulations continue to come closer, meaning the outdoor regulations that have a deadline in the end of 2017, the indoor regulations that are currently driving some encouraging performance in our POS related technologies, I think those dynamics will continue to improve GVR's performance. GVR was a little lighter here in the second quarter, but I think good year-to-date. But I think we'd look to see that accelerate in the back half of 2015 and clearly into 2016.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks lot.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Just to name one, yeah.
C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks lot.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yep, thanks, Steve.
Operator: We'll hear next from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just want to echo Steve's comments. Boring is good. I think this quarter is going to stack up very well versus the pack. So just wanted to focus a little bit on margin here, because I think that was the real swing from 1Q where you had a little bit of softness on FX and conversion this quarter is much, much better. So I wondered maybe if you could talk about whether the impact of FX moderated or whether that was offset by efficiency metrics. And if I could just then drill into the core Test & Measurement margins, outstanding margins. Looks to be about 24% and change. That's up, you know, about 3 points year-over-year. How sustainable is that and is that driven by mix? Is that restructuring? What's driving that strength?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Nigel, we're clearly continuing to feel the impact of the FX on our margin. Until we anniversary the big move in the euro, that will continue. But overall, very good cost action fall-through. One of the dynamics in Q2, our consumable business aftermarket core growth remained very, very healthy. Our equipment business was slightly softer. I think that's not unlike what we're hearing from a lot of other more equipment-based businesses. So we actually get a favorable mix from that from a margin perspective. But the FX impact is still very much there.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then it looks like the 3Q guide, it looks like you're forecasting on an apples-to-apples basis a pretty significant sequential decline in margins. Looks to be like a 17 handle versus a mid-18s this quarter. Is that the right math?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, clearly there's seasonal here. We're typically down $0.03 or $0.04 on slightly lower revenues Q2 to Q3 and we expect a similar dynamic here.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally on the Pall, you pre-funded $2.7 billion euros of debt. The Q mentions CP funding. Any intention to get ahead further on the pre-funding as you get closer to the close?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, clearly we've done the $3 billion of the euros. We've set up all the bank facilities to back us up, the commercial paper, and we'll likely do a U.S. bond deal as we get closer to closing.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, Dan.
Operator: Scott Davis from Barclays, your line is open.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Scott.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I don't think you mentioned anything about any updated timing of the breakup or any additional details. Is there any change? I mean, you've had a few months to dial that in a little bit, I guess.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've had a little bit of time here, Scott. But we're still looking at the same timing that we've spoken to earlier. We have a team assembled as I mentioned. Team's gotten to work building action plans. There is a lot to do. I think one of the great things that I've seen recently is how the team is applying principles and the practices of DBS to the whole process. Many of you have seen some of those examples of visual management and project management as you've toured our facilities. We're applying that same approach here. And I think as we do that and time progresses here a bit and we understand some of the details in a deeper way, we'll look for every opportunity to accelerate that. The facts of the matter are that the complexities associated with work to do, associated with the audits that'll need to be done, the filings associated with that. The associated tax-related work will take time, and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate the process. But it's still early days in defining all those details.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And just getting back I think to Steve's question, if you look at the deeper cyclicals around the world, it almost feels like things are falling apart in front of our eyes. But you guys don't touch oil and gas or commodities in any real way so you don't see it real time. But do you worry that we are on the verge of something that's bigger from a recession perspective and you have to start thinking about getting ahead of it now? Is that something you guys consider, or do you have enough visibility in your book just to say this is generally not going to touch you?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Scott, I don't know that we have any clearer crystal ball necessarily on the macro environment than a lot of other folks. I think we feel very good about how well our portfolio is positioned to weather storms in various markets. Today I think we're certainly cognizant of the headlines. We've seen the high growth markets become very uneven. While we're still seeing relative strength and excellent execution in places like China and the Middle East, we're very cognizant of the weaknesses in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, the challenges in Russia, and yet I think in many cases, in the overall, we're performing quite well. As we've said in the last couple of calls, our businesses are really well positioned in Europe. We don't see Europe as a particularly robust market at the moment, but we continue to post good growth across a number of our businesses. The U.S. has been steady for us, but again, I think we would look to our own execution as being the underpinnings of that and not so much any great confidence in macro stability going forward.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And, Tom, what's your view on China more explicitly?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we still think China is a very good market for a number of our businesses, Scott. If we look specifically at performances across the portfolio, our Diagnostic business, our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. So we're seeing strength across some of our other businesses as well. Water grew double digits in the quarter. So it's not the same market that it was a year ago or two years ago. It is a more challenging market in a macro context. We've seen some pockets of weakness in areas like academic-related and research funding. But in general, we continue to invest there. We still remain bullish that it will be one of our better growth markets across the whole global landscape.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys, and good luck.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: We'll move next to Steven Winoker from Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, all. It looks like the core growth ex-Comms for this past quarter would have been closer to 4% than 3.5%. And if that's right, Tom, can you talk through maybe what it would have been or how should we think about the NewCo versus RemainCo core growth rates?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Good morning, Steve. Your assessment is right that the quarter ex-Comms would have been about 4% rather than the 3.5%. When you look at the portfolio within the context of NewCo and Danaher going forward, the NewCo businesses grew about 3% in the quarter, and the Danaher RemainCo portfolio grew about 4% in the quarter.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that RemainCo would have been closer to 4.5% then ex-Comms now?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It would have been a little over 4%, yes.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. And then as you see that growth pacing, you talked a little bit about it, but for Q3 versus Q4, how do you maybe see core growth pacing through those two?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, again, we believe as of now, Q3 will be comparable to Q2. We have a few less selling days in Q4 which benefited Q1, but adjusted for that, we're not looking for a fundamental change and despite arguably a tougher, incrementally tougher macro environment, we're looking for core growth to stay relatively steady with where we are today.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Steady ex-Comms, right?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe just a comment on Dental would be helpful. You talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing a fundamental improvement then in the business and how should we think about that business progressing going forward?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Steve, we are seeing some improvement in our performance in dental. The Q2 growth that I mentioned of 1% was better than where we were in Q1. We're not yet where we want to be, but we saw some improvement in a number of areas. We're particularly enthusiastic about the great start that we've had with Nobel. It's not in the core numbers but having a very good start with mid-single-digit core growth for the second quarter and the second quarter in a row. We look at sellout and sellout remains very good. It's in probably the 3% to 4% range. Again, it will vary a bit across product categories, but I think sellout continues to be good. I think as we look at consumables and equipment, generally a number of areas performing better than they were. Still some work to do, but we think we're approaching the tail-end of some inventory related destocking activities that impacted primarily the equipment side, and were more or less isolated to the North American market. So I think quite a number of things to be encouraged about and clearly still some work to do in some spots.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners, your line is open.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Jeff.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of quick ones. First, just China overall, can you say if you bid – I missed it – what the China growth rate was in the quarter overall?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Jeff, we were about 8%, 9% which has been remarkably consistent. We were just talking about it with the China team the last five or six quarters.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah, that is solid. And then on water treatment, Dan or Tom, what's actually driving the activity there? Can you provide a little granularity on muni versus industrial or geographic and how you think that trends in the back half of the year?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Absolutely, Jeff. Let's start with the Hach business. The Hach business continues to perform very well. Another very good quarter. I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter, but continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing – we've seen pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D. And I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment net business and very, very good execution. If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan a little bit more CapEx exposure. Had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis, and this is a lumpy business given the project nature, more CapEx oriented. But generally we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. We talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We noted that we filed formally for U.S. type approval via the coast guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing. But we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there. And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macro environment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada, and so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset.
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Just one more quick one. Thank you, Tom, for all that. It sounds like the smaller bolt-ons might be ramping up. Did any of those happen in what's going to be the NewCo in the quarter and do you anticipate bolt-ons in the NewCo as you work through this process?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Jeff, we definitely do. And we're spending a lot more time with Jim and his team ramping up that effort. And I would expect to see some bolt-ons here in NewCo in the next 12 months, 18 months
Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: We'll hear next from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Can you talk a little bit about the variation in the core margin improvement across the segments? You had a couple real strong runs, right, with Environmental and Industrial, and then LS&D up a little less on core and then Dental down. I know you're doing some investments and some restructuring there. Maybe just give us a feel for what you're doing there and what kind of benefit we might see coming out of it.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. It's Dan, Shannon. On Life Science Diagnostics, that is a segment that we get probably hit the hardest from an FX perspective, but on a constant-currency basis, they would have been up 100 basis points. So kind of feel underlying from a core perspective, we're making the progress we should be making but just paying a lot of FX pain right now. Good core growth numbers. We are investing, high growth markets, new products, so I think you're seeing some of the impact there. But you're seeing it on the core growth side. Dental is a function of very modest core growth, growing 1%, tougher to expand those margins. We'll need a little better core growth to see core margin expansion here in the second half.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then how do you guys feel about the overall healthcare market? I mean, you said I think Life Sciences was up double digits in the U.S., which seemed remarkably strong. I know you guys in a lot of your businesses have new products driving a lot of growth. I mean, is that Life Sciences' number a function of just overall market or just how do you feel about the market?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Shannon, we think about the market first of all in, probably to keep it simple, two different dimensions. We think about it in terms of truly more of a healthcare-oriented market, the term you used, that would impact our Diagnostic businesses more. And then more of a Life Science market that is more skewed towards selling to life science related academic and research institutions, universities, pharma, big pharma, food testing, et cetera. So first and foremost, we sort of separate it into those two segments of the market. Specific to your question about our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high growth market challenges had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. and that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macro environment. Back on the healthcare side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally hospitals are in better shape financially today, so we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but, again, I would point to our execution, improvements in Beckman's overall performance, certainly Radiometer, a consistent performer, Leica Biosystems growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Shannon.
Operator: Up next is Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ross.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: So I thought I'd start just, you were talking a bit about Life Sciences, digging in just a little more in the biopharma side. It's obviously going to get more important when you close Pall, but it seems like a very kind of healthy sub-segment. We've seen it across the board. Maybe a little color of what you saw in SCIEX in that segment. And I know you obviously haven't closed Pall yet, but filtration numbers across the board have been consistently spectacular this quarter, and so as you're thinking about where you touch today, particularly on the biotech side, but where you will be going forward, how do you feel about that end market specifically?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Ross, we feel very good about that end market as we, I think, pointed out in a number of our conversations about the Pall transaction. We see the biopharma market to be one of the most attractive markets from a sustainable growth perspective in the years to come. You saw that in Pall's reported numbers coming out of their last quarter. So we feel very good about the growth prospects there. Specific to our business, I would probably point to SCIEX specifically as a business that performed very well. Their approach to that market is broad-based in terms of the full range of pharma customers, and we continue to see good growth. They were one of our best performers in the life science platform and, specifically, a very strong performer in North America. So we remain very bullish on that market.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: And maybe, Dan, just building off of the prior question on sort of tuck-in activity at NewCo, one of the things I've heard from folks is a concern about valuations across that complex and a lack of targets that fit the old Danaher model. I guess as you look at the pipeline there and the types of businesses or the size of businesses and public versus private, do you see a pretty good plethora of opportunities and do you feel like it's difficult given valuations there to do deals, or do you feel like there's pockets where you still could see some pretty good high return type acquisitions?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I don't think we would have announced a separation if we didn't see a significant opportunity there. And just in the last 45 days, we really kind of geared up again the M&A activity for many of what will be Jim's businesses. We're already starting to see some bolt-ons that I think will come through in the next six months, but I think there are also larger opportunities in time. And that is a team at Fluke, Gilbarco that have executed extremely well on their bolt-on adjacent-type acquisitions, and we feel very good about that opportunity going forward.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks, guys.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Just had a question around in Industrial on the product ID side. It looks like you're still outgrowing the market maybe 2x or so. Maybe just give some color as to what's driving that. Is there some disruption at Domino because of the merger? Is it a product suite issue or do you think it's more fundamental around the software expertise?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thanks, Julian, and good morning. Product ID, specifically Videojet, I'll start with Videojet, has performed very well. I would say that it is largely a function of very strong DBS-oriented execution at VJ. Some of the growth-oriented tools of DBS that we've spoken about in the past, tools around funnel management and transformative marketing, have really been developed and brought to maturity at Videojet. And we've seen the impact of the utilization of those tools in their commercial execution and the resulting growth performance and share gains. So it's a great job by that team, and I think we'll continue to see good performance there. That performance is replicated or is very similar when we look at Esko and X-Rite, two terrific acquisitions that the platform has done, really broadening its footprint and bringing a broader suite of solutions to brand owners. And so I think all is tracking in the right direction in terms of the platform. Relative to Domino, we have not seen any particular impact of that. The PID business in general and VJ specifically is performing exceptionally well in Europe. And so I think we're in good shape.
Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just to follow up on Dental, it sounded like the sellout has been pretty good, which I guess would mean the inventories have sort of run their course. But Dan sounded fairly certain with respect about the scope for the margin expansion in dental in the second half. So I just wanted to understand, do you think Q3 and Q4 will see an acceleration in Dental?
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We will. I think it'll still be relatively modest but it will be better than what we've seen here in the first half. We were encouraged by consumables returning to a more normal growth level, more typical margin performance. And while equipment was a tad better, and the sellout numbers are fine, I'm not sure we're entirely done from a destock perspective. I think we've got the biggest pieces behind us but I still think there'll be a little bit more here in the second half.
Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then lastly just very quickly, the SG&A costs in Q1 I think had caused a bit of consternation around their increase, more normal in Q2. Given the SG&A to sales should continue to sort of – the increases should level off there in the second half.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I mean, on a sequential basis, clearly part of that's Nobel which comes in with a direct selling model, so it's a pretty more heftier selling expense, but you should see some continued normalization.
Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Moving next to Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Isaac.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. I just want to stay on the Dental theme for a minute here. The destocking dynamic, that's the second quarter in a row, and I think, if I understood Dan's comments there previously, sounds like there might be a little more to go. I'm just curious why that is.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think these are the types of things that obviously take some time. They're worked, Isaac, in collaboration with our distribution partners. You've got some balancing going on between different product lines, and so it's really just an evolutionary process.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And so if we were to try and look at the year holistically, the first half's been pretty flat. The last few years you've been closer to 3% or so. Is it unrealistic to think, given the destocking dynamics that 3% is possible this year for the full year?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it might be a stretch for the full year, but I think in the second half, we'd be looking to try to achieve that kind of number.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Isaac.
Operator: And your final question today will come from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Considering all the transactions you have going on, you still were able to complete five bolt-ons. Maybe a comment on what that pipeline looks like and capacity both capital and management eyeballs to get more deals done.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Deane, we're pretty happy. We did see the pace of bolt-ons ramp up last year. That's continued here in the first half. On the margin, some of the incremental choppiness in the macro environment is helping get some of these bolt-ons to the finish line. Now that we're geared up here with Jim and many of his businesses, I expect that pace to continue. We're not going to do any multibillion dollar deals here in the next 12 months, but I think you should see a very healthy continued pace of bolt-ons across the platform.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then just the last question, if you could put the spotlight on the Sutron deal for a moment and hydrological monitoring. It's interesting that's part of environmental, but it's Hach environmental. What are the linkages with Sutron and water quality both from a technology standpoint but also go to market?
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Deane, we have a suite of products in our Hach portfolio, Hach Lange portfolio, that we refer to as Hach environmental. And we use that term to reference the fact that that suite of products, those instruments and software and various communications modalities, allow us to provide capabilities outside of municipal and industrial water, namely in rivers, lakes, streams, tributaries, and all the way out into the blue ocean – the deep ocean areas with businesses like Sea-Bird. What Sutron provides us is a bolt-on acquisition that adds capabilities in satellite communications, in remote data transfer that add significant potential to instruments that are already installed in those applications. And so it's a tremendous add. It's a business that we've known for a long time. We've had an excellent relationship over many years with the leaders of that business, and we're thrilled to have them join the portfolio.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Deane.
Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.

Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macro environment using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter. DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct, and execute on high impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, seven of our nine strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter including test and measurement instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation. We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance. This is another record first quarter for Danaher, adjusted, diluted net earnings per share was $0.93 including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January. Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion with core revenues up 5% due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%. Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits, but performance was mixed as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10% led by our dental, diagnostics, and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed market also grew at a mid-single-digit rate with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior-year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4% marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency. With three of our five segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%. On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on three bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter including the acquisition of the Siemens Microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our dental, diagnostics, and Product ID platforms. In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel combined with recent volatility in the global volatility markets uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity. Turning to our five operating segments. Test and measurement revenues declined 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points and core operating margin declined 225 basis points largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin communications platform. Core revenues in our instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter led by the developed markets and China. Fluke core revenues were up high single digits as it's biomedical and tomography product lines each increased double digits. Strengthen in tomography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines in articulating lens, on camera analytics and the industries largest responsive LCD touch screen allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot. At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced new type of high-performance ATI oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most common complex problems. Core revenues from our communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we will achieve positive core growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015 and this morning we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions. Moving to our environmental segment, revenues increased 7% with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%. Our water quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10% with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had an outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double digits as the team's application of DBS growth tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing continued to drive share gains. We've built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough water quality testing system the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, or PPA in over 40 countries. Notably the PPA's ease-of-use has a ready started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality tests making it one of the most important new products in the market. At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investment in Feet-on-the-Street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America with its most recent acquisition Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root crew midfielder gets driven by strength in China and the U.S. In U.S., upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades. Turning now to Life Sciences and Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by one-time non-cash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens Microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter MicroScan. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines. In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates help drive mid single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is as an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Vallejo, California for our Investor and Analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story. In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of MicroScan. MicroScan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments. Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its13th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT consumables. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of procalcitonin assay or PCT. PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on site in operating rooms and other critical care centers enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives. Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits led by Advanced Staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S. where the stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending. We were also encouraged by a strong start at Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December where reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools, helps to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter. Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter. SCIEX score sales grew double digits led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters. Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due to impart to a difficult comparison in Japan where we saw a record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we are confident in Leica steady stream of new product innovation including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMi8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users. Turning to Dental; our dental revenue increased 30% with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines and combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we are encouraged by improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year. Nobel Biocare completed his first full quarter with Danaher and we've made great progress so far while it's still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single digit average daily sales growth for the quarter. One of Danaher's core values innovation defines our future, certainly rang true at the Biannual International Dental Show in March, where KaVo Kerr Group and Nobel Biocare launched much more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated Chairside CAD/CAM solution which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices. In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5% with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011. Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits with robust demand for our marking and coding color management and software solutions. Videojet had a solid start to the year delivering high single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and1650 high-resolution micro-printers that enable fast, high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care where legibility and clarity are critical because consumer safety and industry regulations. In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools. So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015 delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using Danaher business system continued to drive relative out-performance and enhanced our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macro environment. However, we're confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high-impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come. We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Lisa, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: And ask a little of FX and I think we understand the impact of translation, I think most people do at least for the group overall, but what does that FX really mean for you guys as it relates to global competition, does it change how you think about where you produce and where you ship out over, there is a change or impact of price dynamic at all, or is it really not much of an impact?
Tom Joyce: Well, Scott, I guess we first start and think about FX from a competitive perspective. And it's hard not to think the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example. We continue to perform exceptionally well there we have during the entire shift of the currency, we have seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market generally across a number of our businesses is probably more of a low single-digit market on a core growth business. And so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there. You can look at Japan as another example where those ships have happened and certainly there has been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there, but again, our businesses generally in spite of a very challenging environment there. Overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness. Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we are going to see currencies move down, it takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you got that right is a day of currency might turn against you and you end up in a very different place than you would hope. So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that is provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and therefore the impacts have read through -- through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint putting manufacturing operations in, in the best costs positions that we can with the best logistics and supply chains. But these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on dental. I guess I don't remember a time were you had, I'm going to call it flattish core growth where you saw, it looks like in the slides core margins down 385 bps was that just a mixed impact of the higher margin step being destocked or is there some other step in there like restructuring or anything else.
Tom Joyce: It really starts with the volume itself. And that volume being slightly up in one side of the business slightly down in another side of the business, but generally it starts with that volume position and then the destocking, yes, in fact was the primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where we very cooperatively and teaming with our distribution channels made very conscious decision about what we needed to do in the channel from an inventory perspective. I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very, very closely with those distribution partners. And we are very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we're confident in our competitive positions we understand that we are performing well, those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter and we are optimistic that we will see better growth going forward. But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there because we're confident in our competitive position because in a number of areas particularly outside the U.S., the dental platform is performing extremely well driving anywhere from mid-single digit in certain markets like China growing double digit. We continue to invest in that business. Investing in new products, you heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform. Investing in sales and marketing, so while we've got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on.
Scott Davis: Okay. Great answer. Thanks guys I will pass it on.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Scott.
Operator: And we will go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Can we get more into the specs of the TiBX thermal imaging camera for a second.
Tom Joyce: I love the high hard ones.
Steve Tusa: On the R&D and SG&A both up in the quarter. Was there some little bit of a discretionary loading, if you saw the organic growth come through there or is that just kind of normal course?
Tom Joyce: Steve, I would say that we set a course to continue to invest in the highest impact opportunities that we saw from a product development standpoint as well as from a go-to-market standpoint. So we set that course quite a while ago. We had terrific reviews last fall in our strategic plan reviews. I think we got a good sense of where those opportunities were. And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well, we knew that as things got choppy, continuing to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that staying that course would be in Europe. Again, where we've seen the slower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth markets were we have seen a few of our markets on site specifically Latin America specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there is higher growth opportunities and there's some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment. Stay in the course in China, right now as well staying the course in India from an investment standpoint both of those countries paying off very well for us across a number of platforms. So staying the course making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's choppy environment.
Steve Tusa: And so I guess on that I'm getting to something in a range of 25% to 30% core incremental for the quarter, which usually you guys is more like 35% to 40%, I mean should that migrate higher over the course of the year, or are we in kind of, are we in a straight off now where organic growth is going to be higher maybe we should expect a little bit lower incremental?
Dan Comas: Steve, I think there are a couple of things going on, some of which Tom alluded to where we are confident we're taking share, we want to sustain those investments. I think the second element is we're having pretty high fall through on the FX hit. We talked about the fall through on FX has been closer to 22% to 23%, so we are feeling some impact on that. But I think it's a combination, but as we went through the quarter and saw the strength, we saw some opportunity to step up some of the investments. And we will navigate that carefully, but if we're in this mode of outperforming vis-à-vis competition we probably going to take a little more latitude on investors.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And day sales impact on the quarter that's my final one. Thanks.
Dan Comas: And probably, I think the five is probably closer to a four, when you look at days adjusted, which again would be consistent with what we put up in Q4.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Steve.
Operator: And we will next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
Steven Winoker: Thanks. And good morning all.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Steve.
Steven Winoker: Yes. I have no thermal camera imaging questions you can't top that. So let's see, just -- I think from a high level here stepping back for a second, this is another quarter of solid core growth, you guys have been putting us up and talking about gaining share quarter-after-quarter for a long period of time, now. And I'm just trying to get a sense going forward as of the business model and the extent to which that in these higher gross margins, you think are sustainable or a function more of the cyclical markets think you're in a new norm at this point? How are you looking at that Tom and Dan?
Tom Joyce: Steve, I think we do think that the trajectory that we are on is sustainable. Clearly, we're in some challenging macroeconomic times here. But again, we feel like the investments that we're making in the right places are driving core growth in a number of our businesses and translating into those share gains. And those are also businesses where we have a got – where we do have good gross margins and we always look at those gross margins and the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher value propositions that we're delivering to our customers those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovation; sometimes they're associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our markets. So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. So that's the way we tend to think about it. And I'll extend that by the way to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics. Good growth opportunities across global markets. High brand preference to professional and users representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable business models with strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately competitive advantage. So that's the playbook.
Steven Winoker: Okay. And then let me ask the obligatory M&A question following your capital deployment point, which is a little bit different though this time, right, we are hearing commentary from other CEOs on how pricey they view the current environment. So how are you thinking about that how is your outlook changing, if at all?
Tom Joyce: I don't know that our outlook has changed very much Steve over the last couple of quarters. Clearly outstanding businesses with a number of the characteristics that I mentioned just a few minutes ago are our assets that are well-valued in the marketplace. And those assets while highly valued tend to be outstanding businesses with great long-term opportunities for growth. So I'm not sure we've seen much change in that, but we continue to be very encouraged by the conversations we're having and the funnels that we have across the businesses we have made some progress here in the first quarter deploying $0.5 billion and we are optimistic about more to come.
Steven Winoker: Okay. Great. See you in Brea. Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Thank Steve.
Dan Comas: Thanks Steve.
Operator: And we will go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe: Yes. Thanks. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Yes. I just want to come back to the dental destock. Inventory movements are something we've heard from other companies. It doesn't feel like it was elsewhere, but did you see any of that dynamic elsewhere across the portfolio.
Tom Joyce: Nigel, I can't think of – not to suggest there couldn't be a pocket here or there, but in general anything material across any of the other segments, I would say no. We're not hearing much of anything in that regard.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And I just want to pick up on Steve's points on capital allocation rather than thermal imaging. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ambition to keep raising dividends and is that an ambition to raise a dividend payout ratio or dividend in line with earnings.
Dan Comas: Nigel, I think the expectation that we would in the intermediate term, continue to raise it faster than overall earnings and cash flow growth. But that's not within expectation of sort of getting to a market yield, but getting to a more meaningful yield.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And you have a target payout ratio over time?
TomJoyce: Well, I mean if you think of the market 2% to 2.5% may be if we were half of that in time, 3 to 5 years that might not be a bad place to be.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great. And then just finally congratulations on the news on the NetScout transaction this morning. Is the impact of that transaction built into – I know it's not built into organic growth guidance, but is it baked into your EPS outlook and how do you expect the EPS impact of that transaction to play out?
Dan Comas: Nigel, first of all, very good news, I mean that really is the long pole in the tent to get to closing still some other a few other things we need to get through, but it's much more common today that we get to a close here early in the summer. It is not factored in. A lot of that will depend ultimately whether we do a spin or a split. Based where their stock is trading today if we did a split, on an annual basis, it would approximately wash. So the earnings we would get – we would give up there would reduce our share count and would be roughly an equal offset. Now that may impact first half second half, but an annual basis would be roughly a full offset.
Nigel Coe: And core growth accretive by about 50 bps in the second half of the year? Thanks.
Dan Comas: While as we mentioned orders are very good in the communications business in the first quarter and the last couple of quarters, quarters are up 20%. So I don't think it necessarily will be accretive to revenue growth in the back half, it would be accretive in the first half on a pro forma basis, but wouldn't expect that to impact the second half of that business is definitely building.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Very good. Thanks Dan.
Operator: We will go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mix between equipment and consumable growth? And then on the equipment side specifically, you talked about the product innovation sales and marketing clearly you are getting some share in some places, but it seems like other guys are also struggling just with customers' willingness to spend right now. And it seems like you're overcoming that can you just maybe give a little sense of what you're hearing from customers as you're having more success getting them to step up and buy.
Tom Joyce: Shannon, we're very encouraged by what we see in the balance of growth both in the equipment and the consumable side. Both of those – both sides have posting good growth. That obviously bodes well for continued performance because as we build that install base, across the number of the businesses those annuities streams that accrue to the consumables business obviously are very important to the resiliency of the business model and also to margins. Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I would say we have a number of examples where even in challenging markets our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetrations in terms of the installed base, I would point to the Videojet business and the performance there. The continued growth of that installed base in the consumable stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the diagnostic side a little bit more favorable environment in terms of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the healthcare market are improving marginally quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spent in hospital environment. As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging that's more of an equipment market than a consumables market. So I think there's a number of places we point to where we're seeing our teams execute extremely well in gaining share driving and installed base without necessarily strong tailwinds from market perspectives.
Dan Comas: And Shannon we were in the quarter equipment we were up mid-single-digit, which was the best quarter we've had in equipment we probably have to go back maybe almost 2011.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Interesting. All right, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on CID, so Videojet clearly still gaining from share, but overall that market actually just seems like one of the better places to be right now. Is there – are there certain verticals that are particularly good there or favorable things you're seeing in the overall market.
Tom Joyce: I think Videojet has performed pretty well across a number of their verticals. When you look at – for the food market, when we look at the beverage market broadly defined packaging overall, clearly a very competitive market, but one where the Videojet team both through a combination of product innovation and a number of improvements using DBS growth tools have driven an enhanced go-to-market model. There clearly gaining share. And they have over an extended period of time. If we look back really through the cycle VJ has continued to perform above the market growth rates on a consistent basis and again a combination of product innovation and go-to-market execution really has contributed there. But yes, I think to the vertical end markets they are good, steady, verticals and VJ is taking advantage of those.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: We will go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Julian.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments beginning a changing macro environment because your tone across the businesses sounds pretty good. So I just wondered if you're seeing that changing macro play into your own orders today in parts of T&M or industrial tech. And maybe just any color on how sort of in recent months, you've seen the short cycle industrial demand moving.
Tom Joyce: Sure. I think when we talk about the macro, it's probably easiest to articulate that Julian on a geographic basis. And some of the changes that we've seen have clearly been in Latin America for one where we have seen some significant weakening in that market. Clearly Russia again a much smaller position fortunately for us, but a challenging market there. China while still a very good market we are performing quite well in that market. You've obviously read the headlines about a little bit of softening there from GDP growth rates of the past. So we see those shift, on the other side, we've seen some geographic markets improve. India being one, again, teams performing quite well there. So I think that's one way to look at it. Europe is still steady, but again, we think we are outperforming in that market. So I think those would be a few of the things that we would point to. On the short cycle industrial side, really Dan – Daniels teams a number of those businesses automation we talked to a little while ago really are performing very well. And that's really just a function again of I think a combination of new product innovation in a number of places as well as is good day today go-to-market execution.
Dan Comas: And Julian, I would add – just you asked about very recently. I think similar to some other companies, we did seeing some pockets in March in the U.S., particularly in the U.S. in the equipment a little bit of softness, it's hard to tell if it's any trend through the first half of April we are pretty much in line here. But if there was any slight shift here in the last 4 to 6 weeks I would say the U.S. equipment piece is slightly weaker.
Julian Mitchell: Great. And then just my second question around the sort of relative appeal of valuations for acquisition in the healthcare and sort of non-healthcare sides of the business. Particularly I guess with regards to industrial tech was certainly on organic growth you see on a much more stronger footing today, how you seeing evaluations in that arena and is that area somewhat more attractive now because we've got the core really firing again.
Dan Comas: Julian, its overall pretty balanced as Tom alluded to nothings inexpensive right now. But there are some good assets out there both on the healthcare on the industrial side that we are active around. I wouldn't put up a highlight more to one space versus the other.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Hey, Rich.
Richard Eastman: Can I just – Tom, could you just double back for a second on the dental business, I'm curious within North America with the destocking phenomenon that you saw here in the quarter given consumer incomes up and disposable personal income is up and spending is up. I'm curious, is there anything structural in North America on the dental side of your business that's creating the destock, and maybe you could share with us just with the sell-through stats are that you are watching.
TomJoyce: Rich, I would not say there's anything structural about our business or our position relative to the North American market. We would agree that the market is improving marginally based on a couple of the things you mentioned around consumer spending and discretionary income and so on. This is more a cooperative agreement with our distribution partners where we've – where we're working with them to ensure the channels are right-sized from an inventory perspective. From a sell-through perspective, we see mid-single-digit are moving from low single-digit to the lower end of mid-single-digit kind of sell-through coming out of the channels to the end user. So and we know that based on how our products are performing specifically as well as how the categories are improving. So that reinforces our belief that we are well-positioned and that there's nothing structurally going against us in terms of our position in the market.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just a quick question for Dan as a follow-up. It appears to me we do some discount basic math against the TechComms, NetScout transaction as its pending and given NetScout's stock price and may be TechComms EBIT as it finished the year in 2014, is there a scenario where this plays out that that transaction and the buyback given NetScout valuation here that buyback of Danaher shares that that's actually accretive to EPS? Because it looks like you could use a math that would show maybe $0.10 accretion from that transaction.
Dan Comas: Rick, if you look backwards, if we would've closed the deal given the respective stock prices are today and we did a split looking backwards it would be accretive. But because of the building backlog in order book, if I look over the next 12 months it would be about a wash.
Richard Eastman: Okay.
Dan Comas: We are going to be – we were down double-digit Q4 down to double-digit Q1, we expect better performance probably getting to around flat here in the second quarter, but given what we are seeing in the order book and the backlog, we expect growth in the back half year when you factor that in, it changes the economics and the buyback a little bit.
Richard Eastman: Okay. I see. Okay, all right. Well, thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Rich.
Operator: And we will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Question about Europe. I think you guys said that it had mid-single-digit growth in that region and it's slightly outpaced the end market growth like-for-like. So I was curious, if you could maybe give us a little color as to where you think the implied share gains are happening. 
Tom Joyce: Thanks Isaac. They're coming in a number of places. Clearly in our environmental segment, performance at Hach would be one of the places that would we point to that's done an excellent job. Again, a continued focus on investment in that market both in terms of new products as well as in terms of Feet-on-the-Street. I think a good example there also of approaching those investments across multiple verticals are end markets. So strength in both the municipal side and interesting particularly on the industrial side. So I think good performance there. The PID business particularly Videojet, I think continuing to perform well there. So it's fairly broad based.
Isaac Ro: Got it. Okay. And then just may be a bit more of an open ended question on capital allocation. Just sort of curious, if you could talk to the extent that your deal funnel has evolved since you took over in the last fall, any things you could really highlight to help us appreciate how you are looking at acquisitions going forward just general themes that might help us appreciate what you're doing.
Tom Joyce: Sure. I think what we are really trying to do Isaac as we look at markets and companies in those markets platform by platform is ensure that we are looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our existing platforms strategically. I mentioned when we were together in December that we are much more focused on the existing five segments and nine strategic platforms as they exist today and going deeper into those individual segments strengthening each of them in terms of their competitive positions as opposed to going wider to the right or to the left. So I think that's probably the primary focus that we have across each of the platforms is looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our positions in the markets in which we participate today. You see a couple of examples there recently, right? You look at Siemens micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman. If you look at Devicor, how that strengthened our position in the workflow of anatomical pathology. Most recently MediaBeacon in our PID platform and the way that strengthened the value proposition of managing digital assets to brand owners all good examples of strengthening a competitive position in the places we play today.
Isaac Ro: Got it. Thanks a bunch.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Isaac.
Operator: And we will go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just a question on environmental. Could you just talk a little bit more detail core growth was just really strong. How much of it was end market dynamics and how much of it was you guys just taking market share or putting new products into the market.
Dan Comas: Well, particularly and water quality where were up almost double-digit. It's very hard to think the market is growing more than 3% to 5%. As Tom alluded to we were exceptionally strong in Europe up over double-digit. Again, at least for the quarter that would probably be at least 2X what the market grew in that quarter.
Andrew Obin: Got you. And as I look at Life Science and Diagnostics once again core growth just seems to accelerate. Why would, can you talk about the momentum until the second quarter and second half of the year, particularly it seems U.S. consumer is improving with lower energy prices or at least it should improve. Why would core growth slow down into the second half during given those fundamentals and given that Beckman Coulter has very nice momentum at this point.
Dan Comas: Andrew, I'm not sure we're suggesting much of a slowdown we were a little bit over 5% and as we said in December and January, 3% to 4% of the year that segment could be more in that 4% to 5% range.
Andrew Obin: Got you. But what I'm saying is why, sorry just to rephrase. It just seems that 5% could be sustainable or better given the consumer trend and given Beckman Coulter finally executing quite well. That's what I don't --
Tom Joyce: We are certainly on a good trajectory there. It is also probably important just to know quickly that there was an impact of days here in the first quarter we have a high proportion of certainly the diagnostic business that is represented on the consumable side of the house and the consumable side of the house is where you get a little bit more of the bump on a days basis. So there's a little bit of a factor there Andrew as well.
Andrew Obin: Got you. Thank you very much.
Tom Joyce: Thank you.
Operator: And it appears we have time for one more question. We will go to our last question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks good morning.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Brandon
Brandon Couillard: Tom with respect to the Life Science business in China, could you quantify the growth in the period. And perhaps peel back the onion in terms of where you saw the strength and do you feel like the research budget is particularly around high-end instrumentation are maybe starting to loosening up a little bit?
Tom Joyce: Thanks Brandon. We saw a mid-single-digit growth in China and Life Science. Again the first really good signs of life there in terms of growth in the last few quarters. So we are encouraged by that. I think we've reached a point of probably stability there a lot of what the government has done relative to the scrutiny that they applied around tenders. We think is sort of now reached a kind of a level set or a steady-state in the market. There is we believe a little bit of a lift in spending overall as well. We are in the last year of the 12th fifth year plan. And usually you get a little bit of a bump from a spending standpoint in that regard. And in general, as we said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that market that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for investment. As our number of other segments that where we are well-positioned like in environmental, like in different segments of healthcare and diagnostics as well as in dental. So we think if we were to choose some segments in China where the government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those that are probably best positioned.
Brandon Couillard: Super. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thank you, Brandon.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks.
Matt Gugino: Thanks for joining us everyone we are around all day for questions.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Tom Joyce: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continue to enhance our competitive advantage driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year our targeted organic investments help drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet. From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our two large deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these two highly complimentary businesses for long-term success. Finally, we divested the electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity. In 2014 we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represent the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share. Turning to the fourth quarter, revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion, while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M Instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe, grew at a mid single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011, with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points, with three of our five segments improving greater than a 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D, in sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013, while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of a $1 to a $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013. Now turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points, while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform’s highest quarterly growth rate in over three years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations such as Fluke Connect. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, with our core industrial and biomedical product lines, each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy. At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radio frequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB powered device, which offers as much functionality as a bench-top equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radio frequencies of free of distortion and interference. Our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprises businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions where we continued to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the topline, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2 times for the second half of 2014. And we believe our communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect a combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our communications business or NetScout. At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25%, with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail Security Analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global network in real time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history. Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses. Hach had another outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits, as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government’s continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process. Hach’s new product introductions, including the SL1000 have exceeded expectations, with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013. ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving 400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to market model. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits, as sales of point of sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make a deferred solution among customers, looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR’s vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits. Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year, segment core operating margin has improved over a 100 basis points. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits, with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business where new product such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued, with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman’s bone metabolism testing menu, as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be Vitamin D deficient. Beckman also introduced four immunosuppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients. Radiometer’s core revenues were up approximately 10%, with HemoCue sales increasing double-digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5 times to nearly $800 million, while tripling operating profit. Leica Biosystems core sales were up high-single digits, with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year, particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of Bond systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally-invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence. Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics AB SCIEX’s innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named one of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by the Analytical Scientist magazine. Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from The Scientist Magazine. The STED further advanced its research in important fields such as immunology by providing scientist a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells. Turning to Dental; segment revenues increased 6%, while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We are excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team and the business end 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers and we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel’s performance with you in the coming months. Dental consumables core revenues were up low-single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business continues to perform well growing double digits. During the quarter we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of ElementsFree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontist unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals. Dental technologies core revenues were up low-single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advanced in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to-date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment; revenues declined 1%, while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low-single digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, with high-single digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high-single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched remote services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With remote services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these help Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014. X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in-print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high-single-digit growth in X-Rite’s color standards business in 2014. So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher business system helped us to gain market share, while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, we’re confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes non-cash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We’re also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal which we expect to close in the near-term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Aaron, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will first go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Steven Winoker: Thanks and good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Good morning Steve.
Steven Winoker: Hope you’re staying warm and dried down there.
Tom Joyce: And same to you and to all on the call. Thanks for what might have been a challenging morning for many.
Steven Winoker: I’m sure none of us have missed this, anyway. Core operating margin in T&M and Environmental, could you just walk us through the slight decline in T&M and a bigger one in Environmental. What drove that? Little more detail there would be great.
Dan Comas: Sure Steve. The Test & Measurement in -- obviously the decline this quarter is lot less than it has been in previous quarter and it is largely driven by the communications business, which was again down mid-teen. So a very high contribution margin business and that volume usually impacting Test & Measurement.
Steven Winoker: And then Environmental?
Dan Comas: Environmental, it was pretty clear we were having a very strong quarter both in GVR and across the water businesses. They have a number of growth initiatives and this created an opportunity to accelerate some of that R&D and go-to-market investment here in the fourth quarter. I don’t think it’s -- I don’t think it’s indicative of a trend in all. I think it was an opportunity to get ahead of some things given the strength we saw that began early in the fourth quarter.
Tom Joyce: And Steve, just to add to that, on the Environmental side, certainly talking to water analytics businesses, those businesses continue to perform exceptionally well. They have covered virtually every debt they've made when it came to some incremental investment to drive topline and share gains. So when those guys come up with an opportunity to put a little bit more at work to drive growth in share, we tend to be supportive of that if we can see our way to cover and form.
Steven Winoker: Okay, great. And then on currency, maybe you know -- I know we’ve talked about currency a lot in the past. You weren’t able to fully offset that for your guide for the year, just given how bigger drop obviously it’s been even since December. But are we -- should we -- what’s your ability, I think to sort of provide, you think, maybe additional offset during the year? And then secondly, just -- do you have any competitive issues on pricing what not in any of your markets as given there is such a large move in currency and competitor’s ability to price for that?
Tom Joyce: Steve, on the first point, we have -- in no way, we thrown in the towel on the balance of going after that extra $0.05. We’re continuing to challenge the teams as we always do to try to come back on that. But we’re encouraged by the strong start we've had here coming off of the fourth quarter, encouraged by what we’re seeing in the early stages here of January, so that feels good. But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We’re doing things proactively as we did using the productivity initiatives to get a piece of that back. Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we’d also get a little bit of help and that’s part of the $0.05 that we’ve clawed back from what we think would be a maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport top cost. So I think we’ve got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back but we’re continuing to work on the balance per share.
Tom Joyce: I think on the second question about competitively, clearly there has been an impact with the euro on our financial results but competitively we have not seen that impact. We said after the third quarter, we thought we were taking share in Europe. We just posted a mid-single-digit core growth number in Europe. I suspect that’s going to be towards the top of the class here as all companies would report. So despite the stronger dollar, we are performing extremely well in Europe right now.
Steven Winoker: All right, guys. I’ll now pass it on. Thanks.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Hey, Shannon.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Hey, just in terms of the strength that you saw in the U.S., maybe a little more color on what particular piece of that might have surprised you most and what you feel the best about continuing?
Tom Joyce: Sure. Well, as I think I mentioned, it was a terrific quarter in the U.S. best since the second quarter of 2011. It was remarkably broad based, Shannon. We saw strength at GVR, saw strength in T&M instruments, the tech and fluid continuing to execute better, saw good sellout associated with the fluid business. The Hach business continues to perform very well with our muni customers, releasing funds associated with projects. And we’re very encouraged by what we saw in Life Sciences with good performance in that platform. So it was a number of businesses that that had a very good finish to the year in the U.S.
Shannon O’Callaghan: And some times, we’ve had a good fourth quarter and then you kind of catches up a little bit in 1Q. I mean, this was in sense any kind of boost from just kind of year end flush?
Tom Joyce: Yeah. So it’s -- one of my favorite topics, Shannon, in the first week of any January is that we see anything that might cause an air pocket. It looks pretty good from where we sit right now. The early January orders and it is still early, appear pretty good. So we’re encouraged by that and we think we are off to a good start.
Shannon O’Callaghan: And then just on M&A, the world has got more volatile here in the markets certainly in ‘15. Is that good for you guys from an M&A perspective? I mean, do you feel better about the acquisition environment than you did few months ago or worse? How does that impact you?
Dan Comas: Well, Shannon, generally volatility is kind of a positive for the strong corporate buyer. We’ve seen some of the restrictions being put on private equity here around leverage. That definitely has a favorable impact as well.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Shannon.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Steve Tusa: Hey, good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Can you just talk about what you're seeing in emerging markets and maybe within some of your more cyclical businesses in emerging markets, China maybe specifically?
Tom Joyce: Sure, Steve. We’re continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we've seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S., certainly our execution in Europe where we gained share in the variety of places. It continues to also support good performance on our side on the developed markets. On the high-growth market side, again helping it to causing a narrowing of that delta, we’ve got a slower position in China in a macro sense. Obviously some weakness in smaller markets where we have less exposure but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia and Brazil, clearly is in a slower growth mode than it has been in the prior couple of years. Probably, a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses. But I see, actually we’ve believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China specifically, Steve, we’ve had very good performance across a number of our businesses, the Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR performing exceptionally well there. Our dental business continues to grow double-digits in China and probably the core weak spots remains the Life Science business. We've talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding. But we think there -- that we might think that -- there maybe a point of stability that we’ve reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week or so ago in China and he may have a couple of thoughts.
Dan Comas: Yes. Steve, just add one or two things. We grew full year in China kind of 8% or 9%. Q4 was a little slower as more like 6%, but I would say the tone there was pretty good. Clearly, Test & Measurement got better through the year, much better second half than first half. As Tom alluded to all the -- most of the healthcare businesses, Environmental -- Environmental was up double-digit, Dental was up double-digit, Diagnostic was up double-digit on a very large revenue base and Industrial which was negative had returned to kind of modest growth as well. Life Sciences was down mid single-digit for the full year kind of in that zone in the fourth quarter, but I think that the tone in early January. I think, in part, because 2015 will be the -- is the fifth year of their current five-year plan and they are fundamentally, I think, so very committed as a country to Life Sciences research, I think the tone is little better there as well. I am not saying, we’re going to bounce back to double-digit growth here in Life Sciences, but would not be at all surprised if we turn positive here in ’15.
Steve Tusa: Great. Thanks for the color.
Tom Joyce: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning, gents.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Sprague: Hi. Just a couple of quick one here too. Could you elaborate a little bit, Tom, on the comments on U.S. muni? Do you think there is actually a turn going on there or was there just kind of some project activity in the quarter?
Tom Joyce: Jeff, I think, in general, we see some macro strength in the muni market, with some of the situations in a variety of municipalities getting marginally better and that’s allowed some projects to get released. I wouldn't say that’s the whole story though. The Hach business continues to execute exceptionally well, many of their digital marketing initiatives and their expansion of feet on the street, across both the muni market and the Industrial market, I think is help them to continue to gain share. So I think a combination of a marginally improving macro environment is part of the story and share gains being the other part.
Jeff Sprague: Have you seen any change in kind of seller’s attitude here with kind of all the turmoil in general and kind of the QE in Europe, just any change in tone or activity at this point?
Tom Joyce: Jeff, its hart to point anything specific other than last competition from private equity, which is a positive.
Jeff Sprague: Right. Right. And then could you just elaborate a little bit more on the acceleration you had in Europe? Was there something that stood out? Was it broad based across the businesses?
Tom Joyce: We saw -- it was relatively broad based, Jeff. Life Sciences executed extremely well. We saw good growth there. Our Dental business, but particularly on the equipment side, the Dental business also executed very well and PID, those would be at least three that I would highlight. If I added a fourth, it would probably be the Beckman Diagnostics business also executing very well. So it was markedly broad, but I wouldn’t necessarily think about that as something indicative of a change in the macro environment in Europe. We saw nothing that would perhaps really indicate that. But instead, we just -- we had some teams that, I think, did an excellent job of some new products and we’re really driving their sales and marketing initiatives very effectively.
Jeff Sprague: And that is in Europe for Europe right. There is not any kind of export kick out of there on lower euro, right?
Tom Joyce: That’s correct. That’s revenue into Western Europe, right.
Jeff Sprague: Perfect. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: Just a quick one on the Nobel deal, do the changes in the FX reality affect, how you view accretion there for the year and any chance you could give us the actual point estimate on the 4Q organic growth to that business?
Dan Comas: Brandon, it won't have much of an impact. They do have some cost base over there as we -- we also have some cost related to some of our other Healthcare businesses. The offset is we all told. We have about $200 million of revenues in Switzerland, so that will be a benefit. So net-net, neither for Nobel nor the Corporation do we think what’s happened with the Swiss currency. It’s going -- it will be relatively neutral task. That business continues to kind of grow at kind of 2% to 4% clip and that’s been over the last couple of quarters, they were in that zone for Q4 as well.
Brandon Couillard: Excellent. Secondly, on the Dental business, I mean, a number of companies that wanted to strength in the U.S. in the back half of the year? I mean, to what degree at all if you seen any vitality in the developed world, particularly in the U.S. and is there any sign of optimism in terms of an acceleration perhaps this year?
Tom Joyce: Brandon, I think, we’re probably most excited about what we see on the equipment side in Dental. The new product innovation, I think, you saw many of those when we were out in California earlier during the year in 2014. The digital initiatives and I think, some of the potential that we have as we integrate the components of the workflow that Nobel Biocare can bring to the table along with what the KaVo, Kerr group of businesses bring. I think that’s really where our optimism sits relative to the U.S. Dental market. On the consumables side, we see it really as a continuing relatively modest growth market. You’ve seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth from us. We do -- we have seen some inventory de-stocking in the latter part of last year that maybe carrying over here in the first part of this year, but generally that our business has continues to perform pretty well and what arguably is kind a slow growth macro environment there. Time will tell us to whether or not some of this reduction in oil prices that will translate to cost of filling up a tank ends up improving overall consumer sentiment and give us a little tailwind there, but, boy, probably too early to tell.
Brandon Couillard: Superb. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Thank you. I guess, first of all, I just wanted to see if there was any change in the expectations on core growth by segment for 2015, given you had a pretty good core growth quarter in Q4? And also just on Industrial Tech specifically, you had the highest growth rate pool since mid-2011, similar growth rate in Q3, but a tougher base, so maybe some updates on that?
Dan Comas: Julian, I would say that PID, clearly, the biggest piece of Industrial Tech continues to perform quite well. I don't think they’re really looking for change in that growth trajectory here in 2015. In the first quarter as we highlighted, we think we’ll do 4% or better. Again, we're talking 3% to 4% for the full year. Our internal numbers right now are rolling up around 4% for the first quarter, but as Tom alluded to, we finished Q4 pretty strong and we’re off to a very good start here in the first three weeks of January. We also have some extra days here in the first quarter that should be a benefit as well. I think the offset there are two of those extra days are the Thursday and Friday before Easter, which tends to be kind of slow days. Japan which was a big grower last year ahead of the bad increase we’ll likely be down here in Q1 year-on-year. And as we allude in the call, we expect our tech comp, this will be the last we think really poor quarter for that business similar to what we saw in the second half of 2015. We’re encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of bookings but from shipments we are going to have a tough Q1 as well. But all up, things are looking pretty good out of the gate here or early in the first quarter.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks and then just secondly. When you talked about the Q1 EPS guidance, I think that was a comment around some M&A charges being excluded. I just wondered if I’d misheard that or if there was anything new in terms of sort of presentation of adjusted earnings?
Tom Joyce: That is correct. I mean consistent with our past practice for deals that are over $1 billion, we call out kind of the early charges, large non-cash charges. So we still have a little bit left in Nobel in the first quarter. And I think that will be about $0.02.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Julian.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Good morning Scott.
Scott Davis: And excuse me, I doubt in about 10 minutes later if you commented on price and I apologize but is there -- I mean I know your raw material costs are generally lower and it’s not a big deal for you guys, but are you out there with price increases for 2015 or broadly?
Tom Joyce: Scott, if you think about where your question might go specifically , geographically it might go to Europe. And interestingly, we are outperforming in Europe. We think we are taking share in Europe. We saw a broad-based performance across the businesses in Europe. And so no particular concern there. I think teams are clearly looking very selectively market by market. These currency shifts have not been exclusively in Europe. They’ve been in quite a number of markets. Generally we are pretty well positioned in terms of the functional currency that we transact in. But where there are issues, our teams are carefully looking at those situations and we’ll take price very selectively where we need to or compete on price, if it comes to that.
Scott Davis: I mean, I guess I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but do you anticipate having positive price for 2015 on an ongoing basis?
Tom Joyce: Yes, Scott. And again -- where we will get that, in all likelihood will be the 40% of revenues that comes out in the aftermarket.
Scott Davis: Yeah. That’s what I was alluding to if you are in -- if you are already out there, catalogs et cetera with price increases?
Tom Joyce: Oh yeah. No that’s absolutely right Scott. That -- Those plans were locked and loaded in the fourth quarter and we are on the street, virtually across the businesses right now with those plans and in the market with those numbers.
Scott Davis: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, inverse of Jeff’s question on private equity and competition I mean have you seen the opposite, which means private equity I think for probably the last five years have been buying up industrial and even some healthcare assets. I mean, have you seen those guys come back to the table and say it's -- they are looking to start unloading?
Dan Comas: Scott, they are always in the market place and clearly there are assets out there held in the hands of private equity that we would have some interest in. I wouldn’t say that’s gotten better or worse here recently, those discussions.
Scott Davis: Okay. And last, last but not least I mean I know you changed your -- the cash earnings. Have you changed internally your hurdle rates at all? I mean historically you guys have had a pretty strict discipline around hurdle rates. I am just wondering and given your lower financing costs as such if that’s dropped at all?
Tom Joyce: Scott, we have not changed our internal hurdle rates, that discipline that we've had over a long period of time remains internally around returns for bolt-ons at three years and broad -- and bigger, larger, more adjacent businesses, new businesses over a five year period. That is discipline has been really important to the overall performance that we’ve demonstrated. What we have said is that we want to be thoughtful and cognitive in this environment relative to what might be larger transaction that could have significant strategic value for the corporation, where we might need to take a hard look at those returns and the team here and the board. We support making the right decision strategically for the corporation in the event that those returns maybe not where they we might like them to be. But that’s the bridge we’ll cross when we have that opportunity. And we’ll make the right decision that really drives the long-term strategic competitive advantage of platform or our segment.
Scott Davis: Okay. Great. I’ll pass it on. Thanks guys.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Scott.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Tom Joyce: Hey Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Yeah. So just couple of questions on core growth pretty strong performance across the portfolio ex-T&M but you self alluding to market share gains. It sounds like ‘15 Europe. And I am just wondering is that the case Tom and which businesses would you call out where you are gaining share and perhaps may be if you could comment on whether we are seeing the delayed impact from some of the R&D and marketing investments you have made over the last 12 months?
Tom Joyce: We are continuing to make those investments, Nigel, in sales and marketing and in R&D as I noted in my opening comments. The good performance on the topline and the good gross margin expansion that we’ve seen has allowed us to continue to invest aggressively in growth initiatives around both new product innovation and go-to market, feet on the street. The share gains, as we noted earlier were pretty broad based. And, yes, they were, in some cases specifically in Europe, couple of the businesses that I mentioned earlier were around our life science platform, our dental equipment business and Product ID, just to name of few.
Nigel Coe: Okay. That’s great. That’s helpful. And then we’ve seen consumables leading the way on topline, I guess this cycle, with equipment lagging behind. Are we seeing any change, I mean, just seeing or hearing about the comments from U.S and Europe, particularly in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, are we seen an inflection point in equipment?
Tom Joyce: We definitely saw a modestly better Q3 and a definitely better Q4 in terms of equipment. So if you look at our 4%, we were 5% aftermarket in 3, or maybe is a little bit over 3 on the equipment side. And that’s one of the better numbers we posted on equipment and that includes our communications business, which came down mid-teens. So if you adjust for that, our equipment business was probably up more like 4 plus. So we are not quite prepared to kind of call it a trend here, but we are encouraged by what we've seen for last four, five months in terms of our overall equipment orders.
Nigel Coe: And that 4%-ex comes would be, with the best in how many years?
Tom Joyce: Probably, you have to go back to the ‘11 recovery.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Middle implicate, right. And then just going back to the comments on the M&A process, little bit of FX and emerging market volatilities, does one that will shake the complacency of sellers? Are you seen any kind of change out from sellers? Are they a bit off spread something now?
Tom Joyce: No, as you know, a lot of this has been just in the last 30, 45 days, I think it’s a little early to tell but it’s hard not to be a little bit more optimistic.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Tom.
Operator: And we will take your next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.
Tom Joyce: Hi, Andrew.
Dan Comas: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just a broader long-term question. If I look at the emerging markets, what’s happening in Russia and Brazil, people are talking about euro going to parity. Do you think you need to change anything about your strategy about your manufacturing footprint for the next several years? Even China is growing at 6%. I’m not sure when was the last time that happened?
Tom Joyce: Andrew, we’ve got a long history of moving manufacturing into lower-cost regions. Not all of that has been into China. In some cases, it’s been into Eastern Europe. In some cases, it has been into India and we’ll continue to position our cost structure, I think in a way that is resilient over the long-term. I think we want to be a little careful not to change our supply chain prematurely or in a disruptive way, not knowing kind of what maybe the sustained currency position is ultimately going to be. So, I think the teams are doing exceptional job positioning that footprint well for the long-term. And it’s not all about the individual or the cost of individual region. It’s also about the way we execute in any region. And I think we’ve got a number of examples where our business is where that you might say are in higher cost operating regions. In fact, continued to deliver exceptional profitability and have a real competitive advantage because of their cost structures despite their regional positions. So, I think we feel pretty good about where we are.
Andrew Obin: That’s very fair. And just a follow-up question on free cash flow. What should we expect for FY ‘15 versus $3.2 billion you did in ’14, or if you want to talk about cash flow realization?
Dan Comas: It is our early year. We are very pleased with the way we ended the year in terms of free cash flow. So, I think we would be in the sort of zone here. Again, we have got a benefit in ’14, given our cash tax rate was fair amount lower than our actual provision for the year. It’s probably too early to kind of make a call on that, where we stand right now.
Andrew Obin: But relatively flat is a good sort of hold for now in the mind.
Dan Comas: I think that’s a good starting point.
Andrew Obin: Thank you so much.
Tom Joyce: Thanks Andrew

Tom Joyce: Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the quarterly results we announced this morning. Earnings came in above our expectations, thanks to the Danaher teams’ very strong execution.  Danaher Business System continues to drive superior margin expansion, increase cash flow and healthy top line performance in a modest growth environment. The investments we’ve made in innovation and expansion in high growth markets drove share gains in many of our operating companies. Fluke, Hach, Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB Sciex, Implant Direct and Esko are among the businesses that we believe outperformed relative to their markets during the quarter. These share gains and the teams’ execution also helped drive more than 85 basis points of core operating margin improvement in four of our five segments. Our cash flow performance is also very good, resulting in free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of a 128%.  We are encouraged by our increased M&A activity of late, as we’ve announced $3.3 billion of deals across our portfolio in the first nine months of the year. These acquisition will strengthen our dental, life science and diagnostics, environmental and Test & Measurement segments.  Cultivation funnels across our portfolio remained full, giving us confidence in our ability to deploy our substantial M&A capacity in a strategic and disciplined way. So with that as a backdrop, let’s get in to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported diluted net earnings per share of $0.95, up 13% and representing another record third quarter for Danaher. Revenues grew 4.5% to 4.9 billion, with core revenues up 3%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while currency translation reduced revenues by 50 basis points.  Geographically, high growth markets led the way increasing high single digits. Despite the headlines in China, our businesses grew double digit, led by our T&M Instruments, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental platforms. Developed markets remained relatively stable and the US and Western Europe both grew low single digits. Our gross margin expanded 80 basis points or approximately a $140 million to 52.7%. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D by nearly 60 million in the quarter and deliver 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion.  Turning to our five operating segments, Test and measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to a decline in our communications platform. Reported operating margin declined a 170 basis points, while core operating margins decreased a 115 basis points.  On Monday, you saw that we announced an agreement to combine our communications business with NetScout Systems to create a premier global provider of network management solutions for both carrier and enterprise customers.  We are excited about this transaction which is the culmination of a multi-year discussion with NetScout about working together. This is a powerful opportunity to combine highly complementary businesses in a transaction that we believe will benefit all Danaher and NetScout stakeholders, associates, shareholders and customers alike.  Danaher’s premier troubleshooting, cyber security, and engineering solutions combined with NetScout’s high performance monitoring technologies will give customers access to the most expansive suites of best-in-class product in the industry. The combined company will offer even greater breadth and depth across both carrier and enterprise networks, expanding opportunity through innovation and growth and improving our customers overall experience. We anticipate that this transaction will close in 2015, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory NetScout shareholder and other approvals. Upon close, our Executive Vice President, Jim Lico will join NetScout’s Board of Directors, while retaining his responsibility to Danaher. Now back to the results from the quarter, our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. High teens growth in our security solutions business was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions due to spending delays from a wireless carrier customers, primarily in North America. Despite the revenue decline, we were encouraged by the positive order growth in the platform that we believe will continue for the remainder of the year. At Arbor demand for Pravail enterprise security products grew more than 50% as IT Security customers continue to rely on Arbor to prevent and mitigate attacks on their networks. Around the world conducting business has become increasingly virtual, and Arbor is responding with flexible solutions to help customers of all sizes quickly and cost effectively launch or expand best-in-class security solutions. Fluke Network saw robust demand for its enterprise TruView system and portable network tools which were each up 15%. F Net’s TruView system continues to receive industry recognition and we are honored with the 2014 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from the global media company, TMC. Our instruments platform core revenue increased at low single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits representing its highest quarterly growth rate in over three years. Growth was solid across most major product lines, led by calibration and biomedical which each increased double-digits. Distribution [sell-out] [ph] remained strong globally, particularly in North America and China, where growth was mid-single digit or better. Fluke plans to build on this momentum by launching Fluke Connect in China later this month. At Tektronix core sales were up slightly, with modest growth in point of sales in North America and healthy demand for power supplies and oscilloscopes in China. Turning to our environmental segment, revenues increased 10.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment core operating margin improved 85 basis points with reported operating margin down 30 basis points due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment solutions. Hach executed well in a temperate municipal spending environment driving above market growth in both North America and Europe. Sales also healthy in China growing double-digits. This month, Hach will launch the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer or PPA, a breakthrough system that dramatically streamlines water quality testing. The PPA system is the only testing solution in the market that uses a disposable cartridge to improve ease of use and reduce the manual steps by over 50% in an EPA compliant drinking water testing environment. Importantly, it provides technicians of all experience levels with a fail safe way to achieve highly accurate and consistent results. In Trojan demand for large municipal projects remain weak globally. Encouragingly, we received two Ballast Water Treatment system orders that will be installed in a total of 15 ships. We anticipate the delivery of these systems will start in the second half of 2015. On the regulatory front, we received Alternative Management System or AMS acceptance from the US Coast Guard for a full suite of UU ballast water treatment product in July, this is a temporary designation that allows customers to use Trojan solutions in US waters, while our application for US type approval is pending.  Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew mid-single digits with real robust demands for our dispensers, vapor recovery products and point-of-sales solutions. Vapor recover sales grew more than 50% in China as businesses continue to work towards compliance with environmental regulations.  In point-of-sale, North American customers are choosing GVR’s reliable and affordable payment security solutions as they operate their systems in advance of the new EMV regulations that begin to take affect in 2015. In the quarter, Gilbarco Veeder Root acquired FuelQuest a leading provider of fuel management solutions for suppliers, distributors and buyers of petroleum products. This acquisition further expands the capabilities of our Insite360 cloud-based fuel management platform by allowing our customers to remotely monitor fuel acquisition, planning and distribution.  Moving to life sciences and diagnostics; revenue increased 4% with core revenues up 3%. Core operating margin was up 120 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 100 basis points. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits.  At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased a mid-single digit rate with double-digit growth in immunoassay, urinalysis, and automation. Growth was particularly strong in China where revenues grew over 20%. Beckman received FDA 510 clearance for its Power Express Sample Processing System in the quarter, further expanding its world-class suite of automation products.  The Power Express is a scalable, high speed system designed to automate sample processing in labs of all sizes across all core disciplines including chemistry, immunoassay and hematology. The Power Express is just one of several new FDA cleared solutions that will help our US customers improve efficiency and reduce turnaround time for critical diagnostic tests.  Radiometers core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by more than 35% growth in AQT sales. High growth market sales were up more than 20% as we continued to expand our market position in China.  Leica Biosystems core sales were up low-single digits, as mid-teens growth in high growth markets was offset by weakness in core histology instruments in Europe. Advanced staining instrument placements were particularly strong as revenues increased over 20% in the quarter. We expect our advance staining growth rates to remain healthy, as our growing installed base continues to drive sales of reagents and other consumables. Core revenues in our life science platform grew at a low-single digit rate, compared to high-single digit growth in the third quarter of last year. Sales in the US and Western Europe were positive, but we continue to experience uncertainty in tender timings and funding in China.  AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in academic, clinical and applied markets. We continue to expand our in vitro diagnostic offerings by launching the Triple Quad 4500MD and QTRAP 4500 systems. 4500 series offers greater flexibility, exception sensitivity and faster data acquisition affording doctors and patients quicker access to reliable and accurate diagnostic test results.  Leica Microsystems core sales increased low-single digits. Our SP8 microscope continues to be very well received and drove double-digit growth for our Confocal microscope systems.  Last Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists including Leica long time collaborator and key opinion leader Professor Stefan Hell. Professor Hell and others were recognized for their work in developing a way to use optical microscopy to study the molecular processes in the living cells.  This work is especially meaningful to Leica, as we collaborated with Professor Hell to commercialize the first microscope that uses this technology back in 2004. Remarkably, this is the fourth year in a row that Leica Microscopes have been sighted in Nobel Prize wining work, and we are honored that our products continue to be used to support this and in other important scientific research. Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 3.5%, while core revenues were up 2%. Our core operating margin increased 100 basis points and reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 17.2%. The team has done a terrific job in using DBS to drive productivity and improve segment margins over the past several years. In early September, we announced the pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare, premier global brand and a pioneer in dental innovation.  Nobel Biocare has expertise in implant dentistry; digital prosthetics and software combined with our extensive capabilities in 3-D imaging, intra-oral scanning and digital restorative solutions will benefit both patients and dentists by further optimizing clinical workflows. We believe DBS will make a significant impact on Nobel Biocare’s performance by helping to drive further innovation, growth and collaboration with our other dental companies. We are confident that Nobel Biocare is an outstanding bid for Danaher and we look forward to working with this capable team.  The purchase price of $2.2 billion equates to approximately three times revenues and less than four times gross profit, which we believe positions us well from a return perspective. The acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 or the first quarter of 2015. Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits as healthy demand in China and the Middle East was partially offset by a modest decline in the developed markets. In the US, the sluggishness we saw in the second quarter continues. Encouragingly, demand for our implant products remain robust increasing globally at a double-digit rate. Dental technologies core revenues were up mid-single digits, driven by demand for our dental hand pieces and imaging equipment globally. In mid-September, we introduced the newest member of our family of Cone Beam 3-D imaging products, the i-CAT FLX MV for a medium field of view. The FLX MV allows dentist to capture a high resolution, lower radiation 3D image of the upper and lower piece.  Our Tx STUDIO 5.3 software is also integrated in to the FLX allowing dentist to both scan patients mouth and prepare a full digital treatment plan from one location on a touch screen.  In our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 2% while the core revenues were up 4.5%, core operating margin expanded 145 basis points and reported operating margin increased a 170 basis points to 24.3%. Motion core revenues increased a low-single digit rate, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth to the platform.  Demand in the high growth markets was particularly strong, led by industrial automation in China. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines which had annual revenue of approximately $100 million.  Core revenues in our product identification platform grew mid-single digit as Europe and the Middle East both thus saw double-digit growth. At Videojet core revenues grew mid-single digits, as a growing installed base of equipment and solid execution in service help drive high single digit after market revenue growth.  During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1000 series of continuous inkjet printers. These printers featuring extended life printing core that reduces down time and enables customers to print almost continuously for five years.  Esko also experienced robust demand in the quarter, with double-digit growth in our workflow automation software and digital imaging products. In September, Esko released its new packaging design and workflow automation software Suite 14.  This comprehensive set of software tools helps brand owners interact with their global supply chains in the cloud in proving efficiency and control at every stage of the packaging, design and pre-production process. The reception of Suite 14 has been exceptional and over 1,000 customers have already upgraded since launch.  So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well this quarter, using the Danaher business system to expand margins, generate strong cash flow performance, and deliver higher than expected earnings. Across the portfolio our outstanding presence in high growth market, investments in innovative new products and focus on improving sales and marketing have helped our businesses continue to take share in their markets.  As we plan for 2015, we remain mindful of the challenging macroeconomic outlook, including the recently strong dollar. Thus, we are continuing to invest in high-impact areas while also increasing spending on productivity initiatives to approximately $125 million in the second half of 2014.  We believe our focus on growth investments and margin expansion combined with our robust balance sheet and M&A capacity position us to finish 2014 well, and drive long term results.  We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $1-$1.04, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth similar to the first three quarters of 2014. so before we go to Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts after the first six weeks of my time as Danaher’s CEO. When this transition began, I knew that Danaher’s future was bright. I believe it’s now firmer than ever. The caliber of our team, the depth of incredible talent, that deep commitment to DBS and our culture is second to none. Financially, our balance sheet has never been stronger, much as we have done in the past, and more recently with the $3.3 billion, we have committed so far this year, I look forward to channeling this strength to build upon our leading portfolio of companies. At Danaher, we compete for shareholders and that is on the top of my mind everyday. We continue to look for smart ways to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders such as this week’s announcement regarding the combination of our communications business with NetScout, the recent divestiture of our electric vehicle and hybrid motor product lines, and our pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare. As you know, we’re always in the process of evaluating portfolio and our focus will be on acquiring smartly, partnering smartly and managing smartly. Lastly, our teams culture of continuous improvement using Danaher Business System will remain our primary focus, because that is who we are and that is what truly defines our competitive advantage.
Matt Gugino: Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal remarks, and we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We’ll take our first question today from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott Davis - Barclays: Speaking of that, the equity market are telling us that there is bad stuff out there, but you guys don’t seem to sense any panic amongst your customers or anything. Can you tell us if anything has changed in October, any activity amongst your customers, particularly in your more cyclical businesses like Industrial Tech or Fluke that folks are starting to hunker down a bit.
Tom Joyce: Scott it’s obviously still pretty early here in October, and I’m sure they are all watching their screens or reading the paper day to day, but I think the simple answer to your question is, no. We’ve seen a start to the October here is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen through the last couple of quarters, but that is certainly not to suggest that this environment unfolds day to day here.  Those screens and those headlines won’t start to influence people’s behavior. Obviously over time we’ve seen that happen, and frankly not that the last week has necessarily been the overwriting influence on us, but concerns over the macroeconomic situation, obviously the changes in currency, the shift and the strengthening of the dollar have all influenced the way we want to position ourselves going in to 2015.  But again going back to the short answer to your question, no, we are not seeing customer panic in the order book at the moment. 
Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, and then the natural follow-on to that is the sellers, you know a bid ad spreads have been a little frustrating I think for most guys in industrial the last couple of years and the sellers have gotten a little, I don’t want to call it greedy, but its certainly opportunistic. Have you seen your phone light up in the last couple of weeks where sellers might be a little bit more amenable to compromise. 
Tom Joyce: Again, I don’t know that there has necessarily been any particular inflexion in the last couple of weeks or phone lines lighting up. But I would say that as the general direction we have seen some increased activity. We have seen I think the sellers interested in taking advantage of what are still some pretty rich valuations. But those same sellers are interested in the transaction.  So I think we would generalize by saying that we are pleased with how the funnels are sitting today, the cultivation conversations are good and we seem to be making progress in some those conversations. So, directionally we feel pretty good about where we are. 
Operator: We’ll go to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Just wanted to pick up on the comments about what might be changing, and you are obviously planning for a pretty similar growth environment to what we’ve seen both in 3Q and year-to-date. But I am wondering if the mix of that 3% is somewhat different and obviously Europe, there is focus attention here and are you projecting a weaker Europe, maybe stronger US; any change in the mix of that 3%?
Tom Joyce: I wouldn’t necessarily say we are thinking about any dramatic shifts in that mix, but I would say there are probably a few things to note. I would say we’ve seen and perhaps we’d expect to see some marginal improvement here in the US. I would say while the European environment has been stable quarter-to-quarter, obviously there is a bit of concern out there right now about Germany and some potential slowing there. So as Germany goes as we know, sometimes Europe goes and so I think there is a reason for some caution as it relates to Europe. More recently we have seen softness in Latin America specifically in Brazil, and of course the situation in Russia has changed the trajectory of that market. So I think when you put all of that together, and then you add some continued very good growth in China maybe not quite as high as over a long period of time, but certainly some continued very big growth. I think you see some shifts on the margin, but we’d still consider the high growth market to be the leaders, the developed markets sort of hanging in there. But maybe within each of those two major – that split, you might see some shifts here and there. 
Dan Comas: Nigel maybe just to add one thing on Europe. As Tom and I went through the strategic reviews here, over the summer and the fall, we actually think on a relative basis Europe’s one of the places we are doing pretty well, and some businesses where we felt we were taking share, a chunk of that was in Europe. Hard not to be worried about all the headlines here in Europe, news about Greece today and their sudden rise again in interest rates, borrowing rates over there. But actually at a relative basis I feel we like we performed pretty well there. 
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so [Inaudible] some mug shakings there, that’s pretty clear. And then just digging a little bit deeper, one of the hospital providers called out some benefits from the Affordable Care Act on their patient volumes, and I am wondering if you’ve seen some benefits from that on your consumables, and then on top of that life sciences remains a great challenge in China and I am wondering if you have a line of sight of when that might start improving. 
Tom Joyce: So on the Affordable Care Act and the impact on consumables, first of all we are very encouraged by the progress that we are making at that, and I would say largely the progress we are making there and frankly across the entire diagnostic portfolio is very good execution across those businesses and those businesses I think are particularly Radiometer taking share and Leica Biosystems doing very well particularly in advanced staining which is an important area of future growth in one of the better market segments.  We think utilization is probably marginally improved as a function of the Affordable Care Act, and I think there are some out there who would certainly say that the states with Medicaid expansion are the ones where we are seeing that uptake. We are also seeing improvements in the hospital’s balance sheets, with a little bit of pressure taken off the bad debt side. So you kind of put those things together and yeah there’s a marginally improving environment there, but relative to any improvement beyond that right now, I think its probably still a little early to tell, but improvements on the margin.  In terms of life science and in China specifically that’s probably one of the most challenging environment out there today. You’ve heard us talk and perhaps others talk about some of the delays in funding in the life sciences market, some of the concerns around compliance in that market that may be underpinning some of those delays, as China enforces what we believe are ultimately good policies for how that market will operate.  But nevertheless, that is a market that continues to be a slow market today, and we don’t think that’s necessarily a phenomenon that’s going to ease up here in the next couple of weeks, let alone perhaps even in the next couple of months. So I think we are sort of thinking that that could be something that continues to be under some pressure, a slower growth market, maybe into 2015.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein Research.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: Tom may be a little perspective on Tektronix specifically; you know this is the first quarter in 11 quarters almost three years I suppose that where it’s turned positive even if you said it was up low-single digit but slightly. Is this the start of something a little more significant, and what drove that turn, you know is there something fundamental that that’s starting to shift a little bit in that business that you’re seeing. 
Tom Joyce: It’s obviously been a challenging time over a number of quarters, but we are very encouraged by what we’ve seen in the last couple of quarters and the change there. I think that team has executed very well. I think they have done some very good things from a product and from a go-to-market standpoint.  Seeing two data points together is always a good thing to do on the positive side, but I think that’s still a business that will be probably a low-single digit grower here over the near term.  So I would attribute it a little bit more on the execution side that necessarily a fundamental shift to an inflexion point in the market. I mean clearly there are some things going on that will drive market growth over time, but I put a little bit more on the teams execution here more recently.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And you mentioned Ballast Water for Trojan, that’s another encouraging sign. Is this just a one-off you think or something more significant again?
Tom Joyce: No, we would not consider this to be just a one-off. We would consider it to be just the beginning and early and very positive indication of the market acceptance, and I think its just important to remember that these regulatory approvals are really kind of threshold events for starting to bring this market to an inflexion point of higher growth, and so we are excited by the approval that we got, the AMS approval that I mentioned.  But that’s not as big a deal quite frankly as getting formal US Type approval that I mentioned that we expect next year. So more to come on that, very encouraging early indication of acceptance and it’s I think an indication of good things to come. 
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And if I could just sneak one more in on the separation all through this week, the value of the business combination you’ve made abundantly clear. Just may be a little more thinking on the shareholder value of doing this outside of Danaher rather than within Danaher. 
Dan Comas: Steve its Dan, I think it’s a reflection of our long held view, NetScout’s long held view that there was a lot of increment – and this is a one plus one equals three. It’s a little bit like our tools joint venture, but we think with a greater growth profile, and we just ultimately concluded this was the best way to affect that. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So you mentioned Ballast water and I guess are there any other businesses may be Beckman perhaps that just from some company specific dynamics should perhaps look better at this time next year versus what they are doing now, just outside of the macro.
Tom Joyce: Steve I saw several opportunities that businesses had as I came through the strategic reviews that would point towards growth potential in a number of businesses. I think for example, if you think about Gilbarco Veeder-Root, and what we are seeing around the early indications around the customer baser moving towards compliance with the EMV regulations that I mentioned.  I think that’s an indicator of some momentum that we could see later in 2015. I think and you mentioned Beckman Diagnostics specifically. I think that Beckman continues to drive their improvements in quality, in service, in delivery and the overall customer experience, and then you combine that with some of the new product clearances and then the introduction of our molecular diagnostics platform [Barrettes] next year. I think that too has exciting potential for Beckman.  So I think because it would be too outside and there would be a number of others if we walked across the portfolio. 
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right, and from a macro perspective it sounds like this is 3% type of economy. It doesn’t sound like you think even though you highlight the macro challenge that’s out there, it doesn’t sound like you think this is kind of a 1% -2% economy, this is just kind of a stable and steady growth type of environment we are in right now. 
Tom Joyce: Yeah, I don’t think we want to go Chicken Little on here, but I think we want to be ready for what comes. We’ve done that obviously over a long period of time when the cycles moved through, we try to anticipate where challenges come and we think there’s some indications out there that would be challenges, but we are not trying to call a crisis here. 
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Yeah, and then one last question just on portfolio mix, by buying Nobel and doing this deal for the comps business I would assume this kind of reinforces the view that you guys aren’t particularly stuck in a frame of mind that was a certain percentage from a healthcare and a certain percentage from industrial businesses. You are going to go where the opportunities provide the best strategic and financial returns. 
Tom Joyce: Steve I probably couldn’t say it any better than you just said it. We are not stuck on percentages and we absolutely moved to where we can add the greatest value for our shareholders by making those portfolio moves that come our way and that we can make happen over time. 
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Is it too late for sellers to get something done by the end of this year or is everybody just kind of looking more towards ’15. How robust is the pipeline?
Dan Comas: Steve it’s not a tax driver here that – but on the margin here the last two or three months and just what we’ve seen in the last four-five months has been encouraging regarding conversations. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. 
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Just a quick one or two; just on the sell side of things Tom, the NetScout deal is interesting right in an environment where its tough to buy perhaps it makes sense to sell a few things. So I just wonder, we are all fairly acquainted with your portfolio, but what’s the prospect for other moves perhaps structured in different ways but kind of pruning opportunities in the portfolio. 
Tom Joyce: First of all it’s important to recognize that there was not motivation behind the partnership with NetScout that had to do with it being tough to buy. We thought that was just a great opportunity not matter what as you might have expected. But we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and make sure that that our businesses are well positioned for the future.  I think we have a tremendous portfolio today. I think going across the strategic plans that I did and not that I saw every operating company during the season but I saw all the major operating companies and certainly all of them from a platform point of view.  And I think there’s just a lot of potential that we have across the entire portfolio today. But that being said, you’ve heard Larry say it over a long period of time that no business has a permanent home at Danaher, and we’ll continue to evaluate whether each of our businesses is well positioned in the portfolio and if we see opportunities for smart partnering or an opportunity where that business is better served to be in a better place, we’ll certainly look to make that happen.  But in general I am thrilled with the portfolio we have today.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Right, and then I was just wondering if we could get a little additional color on just what’s going on restructuring, just kind of a couple of questions and points around that. Tom I think you said a 125 million in second half implying some of it started in Q3. I am wondering Dan if you can just kind of give us a little color kind of Q3 versus Q4 and if there is any change in deal cost and other things that are going on in the fourth quarter and may be just a little thought if you could on where the activity is taking place and what the payback might be.
Dan Comas: Jeff on the about where it’s taking place, obviously a lot of communication to do here, so we are going to avoid to get in to specifics. But the 125 million largely, and that over 90% of this will be in the fourth quarter. Broad based, we would expect about a little bit less than a one year pay back.  So on an annualized basis, we expect about a 100 million of savings and roughly $0.10 a share. Probably don’t get all of that until we get to the end of the first quarter, given there’s often some kind of lag effect, but found a lot of good projects here and obviously we made decision to execute upon them. 
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Any change in deal cost in it. 
Tom Joyce: Jeff I just might add to that, I think if Dan and I went through each of the individual businesses both during the operating reviews earlier or during the strategic plan reviews, it was clear that the businesses were already thinking ahead as to where those opportunities might be and how to take advantage of it.  So we were really pleased with how the businesses looked broadly across the portfolio and came up with really a terrific group of projects. 
Dan Comas: And then Jeff just in terms of deal costs we highlighted some of that in July. I don’t think its changed much clearly loosing the motion business and the earnings in the fourth quarter that’s obviously in the guide here, we continue to work on the integration of the Siemens business that’s going well, but we are spending money on that.  The only thing that could be of significance that we would call it out, if we were to Nobel here in the fourth quarter which was a possibility, we would have some one-time expense which given the magnitude we would call out separately. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse: Just a question on Dental firstly, sort of earlier in the quarter you talked about US sell-through of consumables being a little bit better, doesn’t seem to have shown up yet in your number. Is that something you think reverses pretty soon, and also dental very, very strong core margin improvement performance in Q3 that after a pretty weak Q2. What do you think is a kind of steady-state run rate on that dental margin trajectory should be?
Tom Joyce: On the dental consumables Julian, it clearly is a business that is still closely tied to what we think is a fairly slow growth macro environment, and so I think we are doing a good job from an execution standpoint I think, but clearly we don’t have any tailwind from a market standpoint.  So, we’ve got work to do there, but I don’t think there’s anything impressive, any more noteworthy than the environment in which that business is performing today. Dan will comment on the second on kind of an outlook on margins, but you are right to note certainly that it’s a good performance from dental on the margin side in Q3. Dental technologies in particular did a very good job on driving margins, some of that a function of things we did last year around productivity, some of that just continuing good work this year from an execution standpoint, and then a little bit of help overall across the segment from a mix standpoint with consumables despite the slightly slower growth that you commented on, generally providing a pretty good mix for the segment overall.
Dan Comas: And Julian in terms of margin, for the full year, and there will be some noise in Q4 obviously because of restructuring but from a core basis, we would expect core margin expansion in that 75-100 basis points core margin improvement during the year. You obviously saw more than that here in the third quarter. It’s a little bit hard for me to kind of quote a number here given the expectation of Nobel coming in, because we will have a lot of noise for a couple of quarters. But ultimately with Nobel what we have we think this is a 20% segment in four to five year from now. 
Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse: And then just on the outlook, you obviously talked about restructuring measures you are enacting now, and you talked earlier about the decent increases in SG&A and R&D in Q3 funded by the gross margins. Have your own spending plans whether OPEX or CapEx changed in light of the macro conditions that you sight or for now you are kind of proceeding as you were and you will just watch to be able to put closely for changes. 
Tom Joyce: Julian probably important to note here that we are just now entering in to budget season here, so we’ll have work to do with each of the individual operating companies to understand how they are positioning for 2015.  And one of the things we try to make sure we do through that process is to recognize that there’s not a one size fits all across the portfolio when it comes to investment, where those gross margin improvements either come from and/or where they get reinvested. So as we walk across the businesses we will be thoughtful as we’ve always been about making sure that we are investing smartly in to those businesses that have the best opportunities, that they are at the best positions in their market and that’s where you see [less] for example in R&D and in sales and marketing and perhaps some other spots you might see us stay a little tighter. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Just a couple of quick questions, on Siemens is that transaction that’s tracking on the timeline is that a first quarter close and Dan could you just give the IT integration expenses in Q3 and Q4 are those still kind of summing to may be 10 million but between the quarters. 
Dan Comas: That’s directionally correct; I don’t have them to break down. We just debrief with the Beckman team the other day on the integration and its going well and all our expectations are for a Q1 close. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And then also Tom just in terms of China we continue to put up some very nice double digit growth there as mentioned, and I think we understand the issues in the life sciences market place there and being regulatory and hopefully they clear sooner rather than later.  But it feels a little bit contradictory, your growth in China coming in some of these more cyclical markets, T&M, I think motion was mentioned. It seems contrary may be to the macro perspective that people have in China.  So do you attribute your double-digit growth to your initiatives distribution, sales, marketing or how do you reconcile that. 
Tom Joyce: Sure Rich thanks for the question. Jim Lico and I were together in China, I think its now two or three weeks ago for a number of days, and we’ve sat with each one of our individual businesses, in many case I was sitting with businesses that I was less familiar with.  But clearly I think what we saw was, we saw a very good group of people , an outstanding set of teams that are continuing to build commercial reach in those markets. We are seeing teams now putting innovation related resources on the ground, product planning resources we are adding to our local R&D presence, developing product for that local market and commercializing those product in ways that I think are helping to drive our growth.  And you are right to observe that, that growth is coming fairly broadly across not just for example places where we’ve talked about it in the past like Beckman Diagnostics that continues to do an excellent job. Of course that’s a very big business over there, so that’s obviously part of that growth, but it is broad based.  The dental team for example, an outstanding over there that’s continuing to drive double digit growth and that’s not only good market but the team executing very well. So I think if you put that altogether and it’s a good portfolio, well positioned in a number of good markets with good teams that are continuing to invest aggressively. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. 
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs: Just one follow-up question on the life science business; if I look at your comments here you did say a combination of pressure in China both in terms of the overall demand environment as well as budget delays. So I was wondering which of the two was may be a bigger factor just to give us an insight on what your visibility is on our recovery there heading in to next year. 
Tom Joyce: Isaac tough to parse what you described as budget delays versus overall demand. But if I were to try and generalize, we know that there has been and continues to be scrutiny over, particularly the larger tenders, the instrumentation related tenders, and whether you call that budgetary or you call it a demand, I am not sure.  Now that being said there is another dimension which is, we are on a macro basis, our investments going at the moment, and clearly we see investments going in to the diagnostics that’s more in the healthcare side of the house, and we are seeing obviously the benefit of that and our business is doing very well there. And perhaps that means slightly less in to the true research side of the house, but I think it’s a little tough to parse that much more precisely.
Dan Comas:  I think I would say compared to 90 days ago, initially goes to kind of Rich’s previous question, there are some parts in China that we actually incrementally feel a little better about. But I think to be fair on life science we’d have to say we are incrementally a little bit more negative than we were 90 days ago. 
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful. And then on T&M you guys have been (inaudible) tell a little bit expectations for a continued negative growth there in the wireless business in to 2015 so. So just wondering how broad based that is across to customers and just confirming that you don’t think it’s an issue of market share just more of the environment. 
Dan Comas: We think it’s largely an environment and I think that the thing that’s kind of most encouraging here is we saw orders turn positive in the third quarter for the platform, and that trend actually looks pretty good heading here in to Q4 as well. The issue there is, we often get - some of that orders we actually get upfront payment, you see that in some of the numbers in our cash flow statement, but we actually won’t book revenues for six, nine and 12 months out.  So we are seeing a nice turn in terms of orders. The next couple of quarters are going to be challenged here, I don’t think that’s changed, but I think the outlook’s looking a little better here. 
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen that does conclude our question and answer session. Mr. Gugino, I will turn it back to you for closing remarks. 
Matt Gugino: Thanks everyone for joining us, we’ll be around all day for questions. 
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen thank you so much for your participation this morning. This does conclude today’s conference.

With that I’d like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Matt, thanks. And good morning everyone. Our team executed well in a modest growth environment in the second quarter. Revenues increased 3% and were largely consistent with what we have seen over the last 12 months. Geographically, high growth markets led the way again as we saw continued strength in China and Latin America. The developed markets were up low single-digits, with growth in the U.S. as anticipated and Western Europe slightly below our expectations. During the quarter the Danaher business system helped many of our businesses accelerate new product introductions and enhance our sales and marketing teams’ effectiveness. These efforts, combined with go-to-market initiatives in high growth markets drove share gains of Hach, ChemTreat, Implant Direct, Leica Biosystems, AB SCIEX and Radiometer. On the capital allocation front, we’ve been encouraged by the increase in our acquisition activity. Since the beginning of April, we’ve announced or closed 10 acquisitions totaling over $1 billion, including four deals greater than $100 million each. These acquisitions will strengthen our existing businesses in the Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Just last night, as many of you may have seen, we announced Beckman Coulter’s pending acquisition of Siemens clinical microbiology business, a leader in automated diagnostic solutions that help healthcare providers identify infection causing bacteria and determine the best course treatment. This transaction is our largest in over two years. With our robust balance sheet and a healthy acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy our more than $8 billion of M&A capacity. So with that in the backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported another record second-quarter for Danaher. Diluted net earnings per share were up 9% to $0.95. Revenues grew 5% to $5 billion, while core revenues were up 3%. The impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 1.5%, while currency translation had a positive impact of 0.5%. Our second-quarter gross margin expanded to an all-time high of 52.8%. With this increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage, we were able to boost or investments in sales and marketing and R&D by approximately $85 million, while improving core operating margins by 45 basis points. DBS helped us deliver strong cash flow performance. Our operating cash flow was $1 billion and free cash was $844 million. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the quarter was 125%. Turning to the five operating segments, Test and Measurement revenues were flat, while core revenues declined 2%. Reported operating margin contracted 250 basis points to 18.4% and core operating margin decreased 155 basis points, primarily due to the decline in our high gross margin communications platform. Our Instruments platform core revenues were flat for the quarter. At Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive core growth for the team. Orders grew mid-single digits with solid point of sale demand in North America and China. During the quarter we launched Fluke Connect, a collection of 40 wireless enabled test tools that allow technicians to analyze, share and store data online and in the cloud. We also introduced several new tomography products including the Ti90, and 95 thermal imagers. These imagers feature higher resolution than other entry level models and come standard with Fluke Connect. Orders for both Fluke Connect and the Ti90 and 95 imagers have already exceeded our expectations.  Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits as modest growth in the U.S. military and government sales was offset by weak demand for our video products and a decline in technology spending in Asia. We were encouraged however by our order growth during the quarter, which was positive for the first time since 2011. Core revenues in our Communications platform decreased at a low double-digit rate as a decline in network monitoring more than offset growth in network security solutions and installation tools. As expected, our network monitoring business was adversely affected by delays in wireless carrier spending, which we now believe will also result in negative growth for the platform for the rest of the year. At Arbor, demand for our network security solutions remain strong with orders increasing more than 20%. Arbor is recognized as the leading security solutions vendor among both enterprise and service providers and was named best overall IT company in the 2014 Hot Companies and Best Products awards in June. Environmental revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 3.5%. Core operating margin expanded 40 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, led by strong demand for our analytical instruments and chemical treatment solutions. Hach had another solid quarter with high single-digit growth in China and healthy municipal spending in both the U.S. and Europe. Hach’s investment in digital marketing and online distribution hit a major milestone this quarter as our U.S. Web site generated $1 million in weekly sales for the first time ever. At ChemTreat we saw robust demand for our chemical solutions in both North America and Latin America. You may recall from our Analyst meeting in December that ChemTreat is focused on expanding in Latin America and has increased sales and in the region four fold over the last four years. During the quarter, ChemTreat acquired Chile based Aquasin [ph], a leader in industrial water treatment instruments and services which will further accelerate our growth by expanding our localized product offerings in South America. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew low single digits, led by healthy demand for vapor recovery products in China and point of sale solutions globally. Also contributing to the strength was Insite360, our cloud-based platform that allows retailers to remotely control there retail automation and environmental monitoring systems across multiple sites from any PC or mobile device in real-time. Customer reception has exceeded our expectations with more than 100 retailers adopting Insite360 in June alone. During the quarter, GVR completed the acquisition of ANGI Energy Systems an innovator in compressed natural gas fuelling design and engineering. Compressed natural gas alternative energy solutions are being rapidly adopted, particularly in the truck stop market and we believe ANGI will be able to take advantage of Gilbarco Veeder-Root's leading presence in that space. In Life Sciences and Diagnostics we had an excellent quarter, with top line growth in operating margin expansion. Revenues for the quarter were up 7% while core revenues grew 5%. We also increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&D nearly 10%, while still expanding operating margins by 145 basis points. The Diagnostics platform continued its solid performance with mid-single digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew at a mid-single digit rate with double digit growth in immunoassay annual analysis. Geographically high growth market demand remained strong led by mid-teens growth in China, while the developed markets grew at a low single digit rate. Importantly, the U.S. was up low single digits, marking our first quarter of growth in the U.S. since the acquisition. We believe our higher customer win and retention rates in the U.S. and around the globe are the results of our team’s dedication to regulatory compliance, better service, reliable quality and on-time delivery. The team has also made significant progress driving efficiencies, improving operating margin by over 150 basis points year-over-year to their highest level since the acquisition. Additionally, Beckman Coulters first made their bolt-on acquisition IRIS, which closed in October 2012, delivering double digit growth and expanding operating margins over 1000 basis points in the quarter. So we’re very excited last night to announce Beckman’s second sizable bolt-on acquisition of Siemens’ clinical microbiology business. Siemens microbiology produces highly accurate automated instruments and consumables that help hospital and research laboratories identify infection causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments. Notably these solutions are capable of detecting the bacteria’s resistance to specific drugs, helping doctors to proactively plan the best treatments with their patients. With over $200 million in revenue, this acquisition represents an attractive opportunity for Beckman and the rest of the diagnostics platform and we will spend our already strong presence in both hospitals and reference labs. We believe the Danaher business system will help Siemens microbiology enhance its workflow automation solutions and develop go-to-market collaboration strategies with our other Diagnostics businesses. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in early 2015. Radiometer’s core revenues grew high single digits, with growth in all major product lines and Q2 sales were particularly strong, increasing over 40% in the quarter. At the EPG conference in May, we highlighted the many ways in which our platforms harness their scale to enhance growth and augment individual operating company strengths. Within Diagnostics we have seen terrific results from this collaboration as Radiometer utilized Beckman Coulters commercial capability in Turkey, South America and United Kingdom to secure large project orders. At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at mid-single digit rates, led by high teen’s growth in the high growth markets. Advanced staining grew mid-single digits, as our increasing install base of BOND instruments grow solid consumables growth. Aperio, our ePathology business grew double digits as doctors increasing look to provide more accurate, more secure cancer diagnostics for their patients. Our digital work flow solutions facilitate global collaboration between doctors and other experts, simplifying the process of developing precise diagnosis and treatment plans. Our Life Sciences platform core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate. AB SCIEX core revenues were up high single digits, driven by strength in the academic and applied markets in both North America and Europe. We believe our investments in new products have helped increase our market share over the past several quarters. At the American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting in June, we launched several innovative new products, including the TripleTOF 6600 and the 3500 Triple Quad. The 6600 enables scientists to obtain results 10 times faster than traditional methods. In combination with our SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software, it is the only system on the market that provides a complete workflow solution for proteomics research. The 3500 is an easy to solution that provides laboratory a reliable and accurate way to insure food safety and environmental compliance. With the introduction of these products, we were able to meet the needs of researchers across a broader spectrum of disciplines, experience levels and price points. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew up low single digits with strength in North America, Western Europe and Latin America. Sales of our Confocal microscopy products increased over 20% in the quarter led by robust demand for our flagship SPA product line. Turning to Dental, segment revenues grew 2.5% with core revenues up 2%. Core operating margin declined 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 14.8%, due to both weak consumable sales and our continued investments in new product development and commercialization in high growth markets. During the first half of the year, our core operating margin in Dental increased 50 basis points. Over the last decade our Dental platform has evolved from a collection of individual business to a unified group of market leading equipment, consumables and specialty brands. At last month’s Analyst Day in California, the team did an outstanding job highlighting that evolution as well KaVo Kerr Group’s unique position within the Dental industry and how we use DBS to drive growth and innovation. For those of you unable to participate, I encourage you to watch the replay, which is available on our website. Dental consumables core revenues grew low single digits as robust growth in our implant business augmented modest increases in our other businesses. During the quarter, we acquired Ducks, a leading -- a leader in restorative and infection control consumables. Ducks nicely complements Kerr’s portfolio and broadens our range of offerings to general practitioners, dental specialists and hygienists. We also expanded our presence in high growth markets with the acquisition of Reinor Orto, one of Ormco's longstanding South African distributors. Dental technologies core revenues increased low single digits driven by a healthy demand in high growth markets, particularly China, which grew more than 25%. Our expansive of range of imaging products delivered excellent results, growing mid-single digit in the quarter. Notably our focus on innovation in imaging has helped us build a growing install base of more than 6,000 3D imaging units. In addition, at our Analyst Day, we discussed publically for the first time another element of our digital dentistry roadmap, our chairside computer aided design and milling solution. This digital system will enable dentists to custom design and manufacture crowns, fillings and custom implant abutments in their offices in just minutes, significantly reducing the amount of doctor time and patient office visits required to complete a dental prosthetic procedure. This is a great example of how the KaVo Kerr Group works together to meet customer needs as it will use Ormco’s Lythos digital impression system, i-CAT’s treatment planning software and KaVo’s ARCTICA milling machine. Turning to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 3.5%. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points while reported operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.8%. Motion platform core revenues increased at a low single digit rate led by project wins in the high growth markets. This marks the first quarter of growth for the platform since the fourth quarter 2012. With our transition out of lower margin businesses largely complete, motion is now more profitable and better positioned for future growth. Core revenues of our Product Identification platform were up low single digits, as solid growth in our inline variable printing and packaging solutions globally was partially offset by a decline in our laser marking business. Videojet grew to mid-single digit rate, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables in Europe and the high growth markets. During the quarter, we expanded our coding applications offerings with the launch of the 9550 print and apply labeler. This product’s breakthrough design controls a label from printing to placement, eliminating everyday operational problems such as label jams, mechanical adjustments, worn out parts and failure points. Esko continues to strengthen its leading position in packaging and workflow solutions with sales increasing mid-single digits. In May, Procter & Gamble chose Esko as an official strategic partner to provide hosting and implementation of our Automation Engine and WebCenter solutions. Automation Engine and WebCenter combine to provide a powerful web based platform that helps brand owners and print professionals manage all aspects of the packaging design workflow. Also during the quarter, we hosted the highly successful EskoWorld’s Conference, where over 400 customers participated in 70 workshops on topics ranging from brand management to 3D package design. So to wrap up, our team executed well in a modest growth environment, delivering top line performance consistent with the past four quarters. The Danaher Business System continues to help us as we invest in growth, drive share gains, expand margins and improve free cash flow. We believe our robust balance sheet, continued focus on organic growth opportunities and confidence on the acquisition front will drive solid performance in the second half of 2014 and beyond. So today, we are initiating third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.89, which assumes core growth comparable with the growth rate seen in the first half of 2014. We are also narrowing our GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.67 to $3.72 from the previous range of $3.60 to $3.75.
Matt Gugino: Thanks, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. Tina, we’re now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first one from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott Davis - Barclays: Trying to get my arms around the margin numbers and you mentioned dilution from deals a number of times. But it didn’t seem like there is a lot of deals –or at least there is a few -- I mean at least material deals. I guess my question is why weren’t the restructuring actions of kind of a year ago plus DBS and such able to offset the dilution from the deals and maybe just some granularity into when you think about the margin movement, what part of that was deal dilution and what part of it was mix or anything else that might have impacted?
Larry Culp: Scott, I would say that on balance we were actually pretty pleased with the performance in light of the volume. As you see here with core up at 3%, it camouflages a little bit some of the stronger performance we saw in three of the five segments and we had some real standout businesses with water, certainly diagnostics, very pleased with Beckman Life Sciences’ Videojet. It’s a pretty healthy list there. And I think on balance, having three to five segments up 40 basis points in terms of the operating margin expansion and particularly with LSD, Life Sciences and Diagnostics up nearly 150 basis points, a lot to attribute there to DBS, the restructuring you alluded to and the like. I think the long and the short of it is, is we’ve kind of looked at it, and I don’t mean to suggest we’re in any way content here. We had two businesses with high variable margins that finished softly, more softly than we would have anticipated there in June. We saw some softness in the U.S., in dental consumables sellout that in turn impacted our June there at Kerr particularly. But mainly, and the big issue is it -- Tektronix Communications, the big carriers were soft here in the quarter, far softer than we thought. And we have particularly high variable margins there. Now fortunately Arbor and Fluke Networks, our security and enterprise businesses were actually pretty good in the quarter, but it was really isolated in that regard. And when we have that sort of revenue with those sorts of margins breaking away from us late in the game, it doesn’t help on the top, but it really does for the bottom all in.
Dan Comas: And Scott just regarding the acquisition, we talked last year, we had about $100 million of restructuring spend generating about $20 million a quarter of savings or we had $20 million -- approximately $20 million of acquisition expense in the quarter. A lot of that's non-cash. You’ve seen an increase in the number of deals and from a GAAP perspective, not from a cash flow perspective, we’re feeling the impact of that on the margin.
Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up and you think about 3Q guidance, I’m not surprised you’re being conservative, but at the same notion, when you think about Life Sciences and Diagnostics being kind of back in the game, core growth 5% good and that seems, I’m guessing that's somewhat sustainable for the rest of this year and then you made some positive comments about the order rates, particularly in Fluke and your comps are still pretty easy next quarter. Why wouldn’t the core growth accelerate sequentially from here?
Larry Culp: Well, I think that as we look at the third, I think both from a geographic perspective, Scott, and from a segment or platform perspective, what we saw in the second right now was probably what we’re going to see in the third, which is why we’re kind of embracing that first half core performance as a good guide here for the third. From a geographic perspective we saw a little bit of a tail in June, tail-off in June. I would say that was modest, but it was broad-based. So we’ve got a watchful eye there. Clearly the U.S., there’s a bit of an offset there both in terms of what we saw -- I think some of macro data out there. But net-net, the developed markets are probably where they’ve been. I think some of our team are probably a bit optimistic in the high growth markets as we go into the third quarter. Brazil’s got some of the noise relative to the World Cup behind it, the Indian Election all of that. I don’t think we’re banking a lot on any sort of uptick there. I don’t know if that's conservative, I suspect that's just being pragmatic. So we get that core there in line with the first half. We get similar margin performance, in part because the Tek Comms dynamic is going to be with us through the second half. It’s probably going to cost us a couple of pennies a quarter as they are resolved. We will work hard to offset that. We’re not happy with it, but it is what it is. And I think when you put all that together, you get the formal guide that we’re offering this morning.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: So just obviously homing in on the test and measurement weakness, and it’s been weak in sort of third year [ph] of (indiscernible) growth and I’m just wondering Larry, can you gave some perspective on how much of this is structural and how much confidence do you have that these businesses can return to an acceptable growth going forward?
Larry Culp: Yes. I think you have to break it down by business, Nigel. And I realize at a high level, may be some of the details don’t matter so much. But at the operating level, I think we’re very encouraged by what we’re seeing at Fluke. Three quarters in a row here of growth is certainly something we can all I think appreciate. I think what we’re particularly encouraged by is the combination of the new products and Fluke Connect I think is a game changer for them, but also the improved commercial execution around the world. I’m not sure that Fluke’s ever going to be our highest growth business, but can they be a consistent low to mid-single digit grower for us? More so than we have seen in the last couple of years, I believe so, and I think they are building momentum here, very much in that direction. I think Tek as we’ve talked many times, has a different end-market set of drivers there. Technology spending broadly, including spending on the bench has been muted the last several years far more than we would have anticipated. But there again I think the order books are firming up having first positive quarter in years there. Hopefully it’s the beginning of a trend. I think Fluke will in all likelihood outperform Tek in the near to medium-term. And that’s I think is straight as we can call it. I think within Comms, we’ve been very fortunate to be part of the mobile network build out at Tek Comms. It’s been a what a mid to high single-digit grower for us double-digits in many quarter and what we are seeing right now is a delay broadly with a number of those same customers which we think is more timing than anything else. But it’s clearly going to put pressure on us as it did in the second quarter and in second half, and I think we continue to be bullish about that business long-term. And it’s a business that’s well complemented at the platform level by both what we do a security with Arbor and what Fluke Networks does with the enterprise customers. So three different stories, if you will, I think on balance, still good ones but we need to build on the momentum at Fluke and Tek to have a better second half to help offset some of this pressure we know we are going to see in Tek Comms particularly in the second half.
Nigel Coe : Okay, good. That’s very helpful Larry. And just to clarify the -- you talked about very clearly about the pressure in the -- demand trend is going to keep Comms negative for the backlog for the year, just want to clarify that with Comms not be wide at T&M segments?
 Morgan Stanley: Okay, good. That’s very helpful Larry. And just to clarify the -- you talked about very clearly about the pressure in the -- demand trend is going to keep Comms negative for the backlog for the year, just want to clarify that with Comms not be wide at T&M segments?
Daniel Comas: That’s correct, and we expect to -- our Comms platform which was down double-digit in the second quarter, can be down high single-digits, double-digit. In the second quarter we expect instruments to get a little better so we don’t -- we printed down a couple of points here. I think we will do a little bit better than that, but probably not much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa :  Just on the third quarter guidance. Is there something that’s getting unusually kind of weaker there? I mean, is there anything other than the kind of the tail-offs and maybe in June you said it was kind of broad-based? Maybe if you could just put a little more color around that tail-offs. Because, I mean if I am doing the low-end of the range it gets you actually below 24% other year, modestly below that I mean I haven’t seen that from you guys in the last couple of years. I think so just a straight map on the seasonality would suggest something that’s a few times higher than what you guys have put out there. So is there something seasonally even adjusted for the $0.02 from this quarter? Is something seasonally there that is weaker than expected?
 JPMorgan:  Just on the third quarter guidance. Is there something that’s getting unusually kind of weaker there? I mean, is there anything other than the kind of the tail-offs and maybe in June you said it was kind of broad-based? Maybe if you could just put a little more color around that tail-offs. Because, I mean if I am doing the low-end of the range it gets you actually below 24% other year, modestly below that I mean I haven’t seen that from you guys in the last couple of years. I think so just a straight map on the seasonality would suggest something that’s a few times higher than what you guys have put out there. So is there something seasonally even adjusted for the $0.02 from this quarter? Is something seasonally there that is weaker than expected?
Larry Culp: Well Steve, one of the things impacting the guidance in Q3 is the $1 billion of acquisitions that we have announced to close in the last four months. As you know when we did the SCIEX deal, which was about that size, we called that all the one-time stuff which was pretty significant when it got to a $1 billion. We’re not doing that here. So part of the reason we’re taking down the high-end of our guidance is, we are going to have a fair amount of acquisition knowing a lot of it is non-cash as a result of these five larger deals over the last three months. That’s impacting and we had a little bit of that in Q2 but given these deals have just closed -- in the case of Siemens, we are likely not going to close that until the first quarter, but given it is a carve out transaction, Declan is actually going to have to spend a fair amount of money in the second half year to get ready to -- from a systems point of view to bring that business in. We think it’s a very attractive high return acquisition opportunity, but it’s going to hurt us a little bit from a GAAP EPS perspective over the next couple of quarters.
Steve Tusa :  How much would that type of spending be?
 JPMorgan:  How much would that type of spending be?
Larry Culp: Well Declan is going to cost them -- it’s going to cost the Life Science and Diagnostics half a cent to a penny in the second half. Add to that the other -- the deal cost, the inventory step-up from the other deal, the other 250 million of revenues that are coming onboard here, we’re going to have $0.03 or $0.04 of additional dilution here that -- again a lot of it is non-cash, but GAAP dilution in the second half.
Steve Tusa : Just at a higher level, I guess, do you know you guys are going to be at 3% to 3.5% organic for the year, that’s above the mid-point of the annual range yet, you are kind of guiding at the mid-point. We are talking about some acquisition dilution. There is I guess spending to get ready for an acquisition. Again, I just feel, like in the past you guys have kind of blown through all this stuff. There would be may be some left over scraps from restructuring or some other leverage to pull. I also now recall this kind of lumpy mix creating somewhat of a visibility problem perhaps. I mean does this go to just the more complex nature of your portfolio and where the margins are today relative to maybe four or five years ago I mean this just feels a little bit different than what you guys used to kind of blow through in the past?
 JPMorgan: Just at a higher level, I guess, do you know you guys are going to be at 3% to 3.5% organic for the year, that’s above the mid-point of the annual range yet, you are kind of guiding at the mid-point. We are talking about some acquisition dilution. There is I guess spending to get ready for an acquisition. Again, I just feel, like in the past you guys have kind of blown through all this stuff. There would be may be some left over scraps from restructuring or some other leverage to pull. I also now recall this kind of lumpy mix creating somewhat of a visibility problem perhaps. I mean does this go to just the more complex nature of your portfolio and where the margins are today relative to maybe four or five years ago I mean this just feels a little bit different than what you guys used to kind of blow through in the past?
Larry Culp: Steve, I appreciate the question, but the way I would respond to it is that Danaher that you know is the Danaher you got today. And we had a situation in the second quarter that's going to perpetuate itself in the second half. We are business that has been on a literal care for a long time, it’s not going to contribute to the top-line. It’s not that big of a deal, but Tek Comms has been a real contributor to us. But here for the next several quarters, we’re going to miss that revenue, but we’re really going to miss the variable fall through there. And if that wasn’t going on particularly to the level that we have seen and now we anticipate, we wouldn’t be talking about any of this quite honestly. So I think it’s isolated, not happy about it, but it is what it is. But when you look more broadly across the corporation, there are so many good things going on from a segment, from a platform, from a geographic perspective that we’re not going to lose too much sleep here because we’re building a business for the long-term we feel as confident and as consecutive about that as we ever have.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker : So just I want to go back to Nigel’s question on Tek and specifically on Tektronix not on the communications business. So I think this is the 11th quarter of negative growth, you have talked about order growth turning positive finally here after a very long period of time. But I guess I’d still at a more granular level trying to get the sense for what’s structural versus what’s cyclical here. In your sense when you dive into the different pieces, video et cetera and you analyze the business, what gives you a comfort level that actually this is still the good market overtime and that we’re just in the cyclical kind of trough?
 Sanford Bernstein: So just I want to go back to Nigel’s question on Tek and specifically on Tektronix not on the communications business. So I think this is the 11th quarter of negative growth, you have talked about order growth turning positive finally here after a very long period of time. But I guess I’d still at a more granular level trying to get the sense for what’s structural versus what’s cyclical here. In your sense when you dive into the different pieces, video et cetera and you analyze the business, what gives you a comfort level that actually this is still the good market overtime and that we’re just in the cyclical kind of trough?
Larry Culp: Well Steve when you talk about 11 quarters, right, that can be a fine line to draw, but I think we continue to be optimistic about Tek and its market. Again I think we’ve seen, well what we haven’t seen is that bounce back in bench spending that is typically followed every major downturn that we studied in the history of the Company. Things have been grinding here for a while. I think we see that on the part of the global technology customers that we serve really without too many exceptions by vertical and by geography. So our task and our challenge is to innovate as best we can and in the face of that execute as well as we can from a delivery, from a service perspective in the field to drive a sort of new order growth which will lead to shipment growth in time. So, I don’t want to blame it all on the market, we certainly gotten better at Tek over the last several years and what we can control. And I think that combination is what fuels that optimism. But you don’t hear spending in the table because we need to prove it to you with real results on a sustained basis.
Steven Winoker : And is this a place, a particular segment that you would continue to seek to deploy capital externally?
 Sanford Bernstein: And is this a place, a particular segment that you would continue to seek to deploy capital externally?
Larry Culp: I think the Tek’s team at Tektronix their primary focal focus here Steve is to grow the business organically.
Steven Winoker : Okay. And just maybe as a follow-up, maybe on that 150 basis point decline core and you mentioned the high variable margin on the communications side driving most of that, but can you give me some sense as is all that operating leverage or I’m just trying to break out what went well in test and measurement versus what was really just a function of the volume?
 Sanford Bernstein: Okay. And just maybe as a follow-up, maybe on that 150 basis point decline core and you mentioned the high variable margin on the communications side driving most of that, but can you give me some sense as is all that operating leverage or I’m just trying to break out what went well in test and measurement versus what was really just a function of the volume?
Dan Comas: Instruments OP were relatively flat. OP dollars were flat with core growth that was also flat, so there were obviously do some things on the cost side to overcome sort of in inflation and others, but all the OP decline and all the margin hit was not from the comp side, and that is, of our equipment business that's our highest variable margin business.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to [indiscernible]…
 Credit Suisse: I just wanted to [indiscernible]…
Larry Culp: Julian, are you there?
Matt Gugino: Operator we can’t hear Julian.
Operator: One moment, we’ll take a question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague : Hey just a couple of quick ones, does your guide for 2014 assume the Q4 restructuring in the ballpark of what you did last year, I think maybe you were talking 80ish before relative to the 100 as kind of a ballpark idea?
 Vertical Research Partners: Hey just a couple of quick ones, does your guide for 2014 assume the Q4 restructuring in the ballpark of what you did last year, I think maybe you were talking 80ish before relative to the 100 as kind of a ballpark idea?
Larry Culp: Jeff, we are going through our planning process now, we would expect to have restructuring in the fourth quarter. We haven’t pinned down a number yet.
Jeff Sprague : And then I know you haven’t been a fan of programmatic share repurchase but what's your thought process on opportunistic share repurchase?
 Vertical Research Partners: And then I know you haven’t been a fan of programmatic share repurchase but what's your thought process on opportunistic share repurchase?
Larry Culp: I think that’s a word we’ve used with some frequency over the years to describe our philosophy with respect to buybacks.
Jeff Sprague : And then just thinking about deal valuations, I mean we see what seems as -- what’s kind of ballpark valuation on the other stuff that you’re currently buying?
 Vertical Research Partners: And then just thinking about deal valuations, I mean we see what seems as -- what’s kind of ballpark valuation on the other stuff that you’re currently buying?
Larry Culp: Jeff, so we brought in roughly, if you look at kind of 2015, just run rate, we brought in about a $0.5 billion of revenues over the last four months, not all that close but either signed or announced. And we paid approximately a $1 billion all with one exception which is more of a start-up all profitable businesses, so pretty good I’d say overall EBITDA sort of multiples and situations where we on a deal-by-deal expect to get to a -- exceed a 10% return within three years so I feel pretty good. And we’ve done five deals here between 90 million and 500 million in the last five, over the last three months and feel pretty good about the valuations as well.
Jeff Sprague : Do you think something is actually changed or is this kind of the random walk of deals where your, there’s nothing and then there’s something and you can’t time them or do you have some confidence that things are actually picking up on the M&A front?
 Vertical Research Partners: Do you think something is actually changed or is this kind of the random walk of deals where your, there’s nothing and then there’s something and you can’t time them or do you have some confidence that things are actually picking up on the M&A front?
Dan Comas: Again, in kind of what we have seen in sort of the mid-size deals each 100 to a billion dollar type transactions, we’re pretty encouraged by the quality that not only the number of situation but obviously along these lines of this five situations where all things are cheap, we can get deals done under our return parameters. I think we’re still having active conversations on the larger opportunities as well, I think there is a net-net and an encouraging sign here, but until we pull something bigger down, don’t want to sort of declare any victory.
Larry Culp:  Jeff, what I think stands out for me, to build on what Dan both in terms of what we’ve announced here and what we think and how we think about the funnels, it is really the breath of these dynamics. If it was in one space, it might be a bit more of a random walk but it is undercurrent is broad-based, I think that’s a good sign and part of the confidence and a conviction we’re reiterating this morning on the M&A front.
Jeff Sprague : Thanks. And just finally from me, on this June stay, is that a U.S. comment?
 Vertical Research Partners: Thanks. And just finally from me, on this June stay, is that a U.S. comment?
Larry Culp: No.
Jeff Sprague : Is that a global comment?
 Vertical Research Partners: Is that a global comment?
Larry Culp: Jeff, really we were referring to Western Europe. That was one geography that was, if you rolled up our -- everybody came in line with what we thought at the beginning of the quarter. Western Europe was slightly below what we thought at the beginning of the quarter and that was most pronounced, it wasn’t terrible but it was most pronounced in June, a little bit of a tail-off there.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just on the equipment versus consumables mix, I think you’d called out in Q1 that equipment sales were up, 3.5% the best in a very long time. How did that play out in Q2?
 Credit Suisse: Good morning. Just on the equipment versus consumables mix, I think you’d called out in Q1 that equipment sales were up, 3.5% the best in a very long time. How did that play out in Q2?
Larry Culp: The, it was more or less in line Julian with what we have seen consumables broadly were good, I they led the way. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a lag there in equipment but it wasn’t broad-based, again it kind of comes back to the issue with the -- we flagged earlier around communications with Tek Comms being so soft that was really the major break on the equipment trend that we have seen the last several quarters, otherwise the general mix was very much in line with what we’ve seen fortunately.
Julian Mitchell : Got it. And then within just a follow-up on Western Europe, you talked about the slowdown there in June, I guess it seems like it’s very, very short-term, so it’s maybe hard to read too much into it, but I guess is your sense that, it’s more that the, you had expected that to accelerate as we went through the year and it’s just hit kind of a ceiling on growth, or was there actually some softness on order intake below sort of what you’d thought?
 Credit Suisse: Got it. And then within just a follow-up on Western Europe, you talked about the slowdown there in June, I guess it seems like it’s very, very short-term, so it’s maybe hard to read too much into it, but I guess is your sense that, it’s more that the, you had expected that to accelerate as we went through the year and it’s just hit kind of a ceiling on growth, or was there actually some softness on order intake below sort of what you’d thought?
Larry Culp: Julian it was a, we had good growth in context. It just down ticked broadly versus our expectations in that quarter. So I don’t think we’re going to try to extrapolate that too far here too soon, but it is something we’re watching carefully as we start the second half here. Again in part because of, it seemed to be broadly based, as opposed to the U.S. which was strong and where we saw softness at Tek Comms and consumables that was particularly isolated.
Julian Mitchell : Got it. And then lastly very quickly, environmentally you talked about weakness in U.S. municipal spend continuing, looking at sort of local government’s finances, those have been improving in terms of tax receipts and so on for 18 months now, when do you think that will start to feed through?
 Credit Suisse: Got it. And then lastly very quickly, environmentally you talked about weakness in U.S. municipal spend continuing, looking at sort of local government’s finances, those have been improving in terms of tax receipts and so on for 18 months now, when do you think that will start to feed through?
Larry Culp: Maybe we didn’t get that right in the script. Actually our muni spend and which has begun to bounce back in Europe and has continued bounce back in the second quarter in U.S. so [indiscernible] had good muni spend in the U.S. in the second quarter.
Operator: We will take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs
Isaac Ro : On Tek Comms, I just wanted may be one more question on that. Talk a little bit about the product specific trends there and the reason I ask is I think in the past we have talked a little bit about the secular shift towards software and you guys were taking some steps with Arbor Networks. So I am just wondering if there is an element of product innovation there that is factoring into your demand profile and what -- well can you shed light on there, relative to yourselves as well as the competition?
 Goldman Sachs: On Tek Comms, I just wanted may be one more question on that. Talk a little bit about the product specific trends there and the reason I ask is I think in the past we have talked a little bit about the secular shift towards software and you guys were taking some steps with Arbor Networks. So I am just wondering if there is an element of product innovation there that is factoring into your demand profile and what -- well can you shed light on there, relative to yourselves as well as the competition?
Larry Culp: Yes I think as we look at those dynamics, I think we are really talking about specific customers, specific programs and the time they are in and that’s where we enter the quarter thinking that the rest of the year was going to play out in one way. At this point, it’s going to play out in other way and again not a way that is necessarily helpful for us. But these are long-term relationships we feel good about the value that we provide, the function that Tek Comms provides to these mobile operators. So we are going to take the long view and continue to invest in and persevere though it clearly put some pressure on the margins in the near-term.
Isaac Ro : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the healthcare side of the business, specifically Beckman, you guys saw the mid-single digit growth. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit your view on the sales funnel for that business just given the uncertainty with hospital capital budgets around ACA. And as a corollary to that, the Siemens business that you acquired is I think about microbiology, the secular trends there are okay, but not great. So we are just trying to get a sense of your plan to create growth and maybe grow faster in the end-markets in that business?
 Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the healthcare side of the business, specifically Beckman, you guys saw the mid-single digit growth. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit your view on the sales funnel for that business just given the uncertainty with hospital capital budgets around ACA. And as a corollary to that, the Siemens business that you acquired is I think about microbiology, the secular trends there are okay, but not great. So we are just trying to get a sense of your plan to create growth and maybe grow faster in the end-markets in that business?
Larry Culp: Sure. You really have to like a Beckman headline number here in terms of the core and particularly that turn in the U.S. I think the funnels are healthy, but again the funnels are healthy because of the underlying actions the team has really been hard at work and progressing over the last several years. So when you look at those funnels and more importantly the retention wins rates that come as a function of those funnels, we couldn’t be happier. And in turn and then to see those revenues come into the business, because as you know Isaac, we can see 6, sometimes a 12 month lag from the time our customer makes a decision before we can recognize that revenue. I think that the microbiology lab is a good or the micro bio space is a good space. It’s not a space that we’ve been in. And frankly, we’ll take a mid-single growth business with the platform that we will get from Siemens and do there I think what we’ve done like in bio, in radiometer, more recently with the Irish business in urinalysis and really work hard to turbo charge that business. And I think you’ve seen us do that from an innovation perspective, I think you’ve seen us do that with respect to the some of the go to market fundamentals. And that in concert with the synergies we should get from the rest of the diagnostics platform is really the high level game plan that we have for this business ones we get it into Danaher. As Dan alluded to a few minutes ago, it can take a little while as carve outs is not the cleanest integration that we’re going to see. But frankly, given the degree of difficulty at both SCIEX and at Beckman Coulter in the team’s subsequent success we feel pretty confident, they are going to knock this one down in the end.
Operator: And our next question is from Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin : I guess I have just a question on cash flow. If I look, last year cash flow was relatively flat versus the previous year and I understand why. But it also seems that year-to-date free cash flow once again is relatively flat versus a year ago. And as a company that sort of we look again cash flow basis, A, what’s going on? If there is anything wrong, and if it’s just timing and if it’s just timing, should we expect a pick-up in free cash flow in the second half?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess I have just a question on cash flow. If I look, last year cash flow was relatively flat versus the previous year and I understand why. But it also seems that year-to-date free cash flow once again is relatively flat versus a year ago. And as a company that sort of we look again cash flow basis, A, what’s going on? If there is anything wrong, and if it’s just timing and if it’s just timing, should we expect a pick-up in free cash flow in the second half?
Dan Comas: Andrew, it’s Dan, you are right, our year-to-date free cash flow is relatively flat. But as you remember in the first quarter, our year-on-year cash flow was down a fair amount. We thought that was timing we thought that we’d catch up to about last sport by the mid-year. That occurred I think it’s trending well and generated almost 850 million of cash in the quarter versus less than 400 million in the first quarter. I expect that positive trend to continue.
Andrew Obin : Terrific and any more color just from printing ID on the short cycle business, anything stems out on a positive and negative side to you in the quarter?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific and any more color just from printing ID on the short cycle business, anything stems out on a positive and negative side to you in the quarter?
Dan Comas: Within the product ID Andrew?
Andrew Obin : Yes, product ID, yes.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, product ID, yes.
Dan Comas: I think the Videojet team continues to lead the way, they are up mid singles. If you look at the last four -- if you look at the last eight quarters, I think we are very pleased both on an absolute and on a relative basis with respect to what Videojet and company are doing. I think Esko slowed down a little bit here but has been a very strong performer for us as well and the noisome that we shared with you relative to Procter & Gamble, I think it’s important as we continue to digitize these packaging design workflow solutions on the Web that really are the major growth drivers for Esko. So I think all-in-all, we are pleased with where those businesses are today.
Andrew Obin : But from a macro standpoint, no particular segment or geography really stood out? 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But from a macro standpoint, no particular segment or geography really stood out? 
Larry Culp: Not really.
Operator: And we have a -- our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard : Larry, in Life Sciences, back on your comments around strength in the academic market at AB SCIEX, to be clear, have seen an uptick in the market or that more of a function of better execution in AB SCIEX specifically?
 Jefferies: Larry, in Life Sciences, back on your comments around strength in the academic market at AB SCIEX, to be clear, have seen an uptick in the market or that more of a function of better execution in AB SCIEX specifically?
Larry Culp: I think we are feeling good about the execution there, but it’s probably frankly a combination that is hard to titrate out, one versus the other.
Brandon Couillard : Okay, then with respect to the Siemens Microbiology DL, can you give us a sense of how do you see the competitive landscape evolving in that ID/AST arena particularly around NASPEC and other emerging direct from blood technologies. Can you leverage AB SCIEX to launch their own, NASPEC based solution in that market?
 Jefferies: Okay, then with respect to the Siemens Microbiology DL, can you give us a sense of how do you see the competitive landscape evolving in that ID/AST arena particularly around NASPEC and other emerging direct from blood technologies. Can you leverage AB SCIEX to launch their own, NASPEC based solution in that market?
Larry Culp: As you know, it’s a complex landscape, not only in terms of some of the strong and outstanding competitors that we have there but also the competing and evolving technologies. I think, our view particularly with the spectrum aspect is that what we get with Siemens is quite complementary to what happens with NASPEC. We don’t provide the product today from SCIEX, I am sure you know. I think, over time we need to be careful with how many fronts AB SCIEX takes on, because we are seeing broad potential application in NASPEC technologies. We don’t want SCIEX to try to be at all things to all the people, so there will be situations where we have relationships with others that were we may compete in one space and collaborator cooperate in others. And I think that’s very much the creativity and the nimbleness that we are going to need the SCIEX team and the Beckman team is well here to embrace and engage as we go forward.
Operator: We will take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray : Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the guidance for the third quarter, what was very helpful was when Dan added that there was going to be $0.03 or $0.04 of deal dilution in the second half, and I think he said on top of that its half a penny to a penny in the integration cost you will have to do for the Siemens Microbiology. So that’s $0.04 or $0.05 for the second half. How much of that is reflected in the third quarter guidance?
 Citi: Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the guidance for the third quarter, what was very helpful was when Dan added that there was going to be $0.03 or $0.04 of deal dilution in the second half, and I think he said on top of that its half a penny to a penny in the integration cost you will have to do for the Siemens Microbiology. So that’s $0.04 or $0.05 for the second half. How much of that is reflected in the third quarter guidance?
Larry Culp: It’s probably -- it’s about a $0.02 impact in the third quarter and probably a comparable impact in Q4.
Deane Dray : So pretty linear, and is it split between what non-cash and cash?
 Citi: So pretty linear, and is it split between what non-cash and cash?
Larry Culp: It’ll be more non-cash. There will be some cash because of the Beckman integration, but I don’t have any more. I don’t have the exact breakdown of that. 
Deane Dray :

Operator: Good morning everyone. My name is Debbie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin your conference.
Matt McGrew: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Matt Gugino, our Director of Investor Relations. We are also joined by Steve Rales, our Chairman of the Board. Given last night’s announcement on the CEO transition, our earnings calls can be slightly different format here this quarter wherein Steve will open with a couple of remarks on the transition before getting into the details of the quarter and then the Q&A. So with that, let’s get through the disclosures. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Financial Information. The audio portion of this call will be archived in the Investor section of our website later today under the heading Investor Events and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until April 24, 2014. The replay number is (888) 203-1112 in the U.S. and (719) 457-0820 internationally and the confirmation code is 6763223. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials and our first quarter Form 10-Q describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate to the first quarter of 2014 and relates only to the continuing operation of Danaher's businesses, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in the financial metrics are year-over-year. During the call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are the subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence Culp: Matt, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I’d like to say a few words about the announcement we made yesterday regarding the CEO succession. Next year, marks my 25th anniversary with the company with more than half of that time as President and CEO. I’ll be in the fortunate position next year of having 14 years in the CEO saddle, while yet still shy of my 52nd birthday. Although many CEOs do not serve this long, I am sure last night’s news comes as a surprise for many of you not because of my tenure, but because of my age. I am convinced in my head that it’s the right time for a transition, both for Danaher and for me personally. This decision is mine. So let me answer the obvious question, why? It’s pretty simple actually, after spending half of my life with this great company, I’d like to do something different in the next chapter of my life. Danaher today is strong, I think you see that in our results and we have every conceivable strategic degree of freedom in front of us. The team is strong and Tom is the right person to be our next CEO. I’m a life-long student of Thomas Jefferson and have always been struck by the wisdom of what he has written about the benefits of revolution every twenty years or so. So while I don’t anticipate a revolution per se at Danaher, I do take a fresh look of free swing to be a value to the company. That said, this decision is hard on the hard. I love this job and more importantly the people with whom I get to work every day. I will miss them greatly. So many of you have asked so what I am going to do. Well, after this call, I am going to go back to work. We have a lot going on and there is much I want to do before next March. First, Tom, the rest of the team and I will be working closely to effect the smooth Danaher class transition. In turn, I am looking forward to spending more time in some areas of real interest to me, particularly education and perhaps even teaching. I am also keen doing some things with my family with the 24/7 nature of this job to make difficult. And I am hopeful that I will be able to bend the rod more regularly than I had in recent years. But good bye to the long way off today. So let me stop there and hand it over to our Chairman, Steven Rales for a few comments before we discuss the details of the first quarter.
Steve Rales: Thank you, Larry and good morning everyone. I’d like to begin by saying that the Board fully endorses everything that Larry has just said. He has done an outstanding job to this company for 24 years and in particular as CEO during the past 13 years. As most of you know, we will be sorry to see Larry eventually move on, but we respect his personal decision and are fully confident we will have a smooth transition just as we did with our two previous CEO transitions. As all of us well know, Larry has been instrumental in driving Danaher’s success. Just a few highlights. Revenues I have watched them grown from about $4 billion to nearly $20 billion while our market cap has grown from under $10 billion to more than $50 billion. Shareholder returns of five times that of the S&P 500 index since Larry took the rings. Our annual revenue and high growth markets has increased ten-folds from less than $500 million to now $5 billion and free cash flow has exceeded net income every year of his tenure. At the same time. Larry has played a central role in expanding the Danaher business system and is building Danaher into a science and technology company. He has also developed the deep and talented management team that is ready to take on new challenges. Larry is the first to acknowledge that there is always more work to be done, but mean time, Board and management recognizes his many achievements and we thank him for his (Inaudible). Fortunately, Danaher has a history of developing strong managers and Tom Joyce is ready to become our next CEO. Tom has spent 25 years with Danaher and in 53 still has plenty of runway ahead of him. He has succeeded throughout his career and challenging assignments in all parts of Danaher. Tom is a superb strategic thinker with strong operating and people skills. He is currently responsible for our water quality, life sciences, and diagnostics platforms which collectively represents $9 billion of annual revenues. He help shape the current portfolio with the acquisition and integration of many of Danaher’s leading brands including Beckman Coulter, AB SCIEX and ChemTreat. He is also a seasoned teacher and practitioner of DBS and has played a key role in enhancing many of the tools and metrics upon which DBS is built. All of us have great confidence in Tom’s ability to lead Danaher to execute on our strategic priorities and in turn with the supporting cast and 65,000 plus associates create significant value for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call back to Larry to talk about earnings.
Lawrence Culp: Happy with that Steve, thank you. We are off to a good start in 2014 and our team’s execution a function of our commitment to the Danaher Business System show better than expected top-line growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance in the quarter. We saw positive impact to DBS across our portfolio for the acceleration of new product introductions and go to market initiatives help drive mid-single-digit growth or better and a broad range of our operating companies including Hach, Gilbarco, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct, Videojet and Esko. This strong growth coupled with our solid cross-management by the team led to core operating margin improvement of more than 125 basis points in four of our five segments. So with that as a backdrop, let’s move to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.81, up 8% and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3.5%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 50 basis points. Despite the headlines, high growth markets remained strong increasing at a high single-digit rate. China grew approximately 10% led by our Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental Platforms. Latin America and the Middle East both grew at a double-digit rate and India was up high single-digits. The developed markets grew at a low single-digit rate as both the U.S. and Europe grew low single-digits. This mark the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Europe. Japan sales increased at a double-digit rate. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.6% and gross margin expansion along with the productivity and efficiency initiatives made in 2013 has allowed us to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 100 basis points with reported operating margins at 16.9%. On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus and in the first quarter we deployed approximately $160 million on five bolt-on acquisitions to further strengthen our competitive positions within our Test and Measurement and Environmental segments. We also increased our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share in February. With a healthy balance sheet and robust acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy more than $8 billion in M&A capacity. Turning to our five operating segments, Test and Measurement revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margin expanded 125 basis points and reported operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.1%. Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew low single-digits. Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate for the second quarter in a row led by demand for Industrial Test products in China and Europe and calibration products globally. Next month, we are launching Fluke Connect, a collection of 20 fluke tools that wirelessly connect to a smartphone app allowing maintenance technicians to capture, store and share data on mobile devices and in the cloud using data captured in our analytical software, technicians will now be able to quickly and proactively address problems with critical equipment before it fails. We have also closed on the acquisition of Unfors RaySafe, a global leader in testing devices, software and systems for diagnostic imaging equipment. Unfors complements Fluke’s existing offering of biomedical testing products. At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly, as solid growth in Latin America and the Middle East was more than offset by weakness in U.S. military and government verticals. Core revenues from our Communications platform grew low single-digits as strong demand for mobile network monitoring and enterprise network analysis tools was partially offset by weakness in network security. At Fluke Networks we introduced the LinkSprinter network tester and cloud service, a pocket-size tool that allows network specialist to view emails store and analyze your test results on smartphones or in the cloud. Revenues from new products such the LinkSprinter have increased 20% from the comparable amount in 2013 and now represents nearly a quarter of Fluke Networks’ total sales. Apart from evolving to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunity may possible by today’s computing and communications technologies, both Fluke Connect and Fluke Networks’ LinkSprinter launches are examples of that shift and provide our customers with the ability to not only perform complex testing but to access, analyze and act on critical information in real-time. Moving over to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 30 basis points to 18.9%. Our Water Quality platform’s core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate led by a double-digit increase in the high growth markets. Hach had another strong quarter led by double-digit growth in service and healthy municipal demand in Europe. During the quarter Hach expanded its product line with the acquisition of BioTector, a global provider of online TOC or Total Organic Carbon analyzers that monitor water quality and help reduce waste primarily the petrochemical and food and beverage industries. At Trojan, we received IMO type approval for our full suite of UV ballast water treatment products in early March. With this approval our team can now see the opportunity to help customers who have been waiting for an IMO approved ballast water solution. Importantly, our testing was performed at a U.S. certified lab which provide us with an advantage as we seek U.S. type approval in the next stage of the regulatory process. We believe Trojan low energy requirements, small footprint and ease of use differentiate our solution and position us to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues increased mid-single-digits led by point-of-sale and payment solutions globally and strong dispenser demand in Western Europe and China. Our comprehensive product suite continues to differentiate us in the marketplace and GVR was recently voted the best POS system and fuel dispenser manufacturer by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America. In life sciences, and diagnostics, revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points and reported operating margin was up 50 basis points to 13.2%. Core revenues in our Diagnostic platform grew at a low single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter, core sales were up led by healthy demand in the high growth markets. Beckman continues to strengthen its competitive position with first-quarter wins in North America exceeding those made during all of 2013. This marks Beckman’s best quarter since the acquisition and expanding its install base. We also achieved an important milestone on the regulatory front receiving closure of the last two FDA warning letters at our Chaska and Miami facilities. Earlier this month, Beckman expanded its world-class automation capabilities with the introduction of the UniCel DxH Connected Workcell. This scalable work flow management solution enables our hematology lab customers to connect up to three analyzers to a slide maker stainer, increasing efficiency and reducing turnaround time for each critical test. Radiometer’s core sales increased high single-digits as we continue to benefit from our growing install base of acute care instruments. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better for Radiometer. Demand was strong across all platforms with core blood gas sales up high single-digits. High growth markets remain robust led by China and the Middle East each of which grew over 20%. Sales at Leica Biosystems were up mid single-digits led by mid-teens growth in advanced staining and digital pathology. Core histology revenues decreased mid single-digits impart due to a large project shipment in the prior year. During the quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Leica BOND Oracle HER2 IHC System on the Leica BOND-MAX. This HER2 test is used to help determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer and in combination with the speed and efficiency of the BOND-MAX provides patients with quicker access to important test results and treatment plans. Our life sciences platform had a good start to the year. Core sales increased mid single-digits with all major geographies contributing to the growth. AB SCIEX core sales grew high single-digits as strength in the clinical and academic markets drove double-digit growth. Earlier this month we expanded the capabilities of our mass spec offerings in clinical settings with the release of a newborn screening assay for use on the 3200MD IVD system in Europe. This assay allows labs to detect metabolic disorders in newborns more accurately and more efficiently than traditional diagnostic tests. In our separations business, we launched the CES IMS which helps our customers more accurately predict the efficacy and reduce the time to market for pharmaceuticals. Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Geographically, high growth markets grew double-digits with sales of Japan up more than 20%. Dental had an outstanding start to 2014 with the investments we’ve been making in new product development help drive excellent top-line and operating margin performance. Reported and core revenues grew 6% representing the segment’s best quarterly performance in three years. Both core and reported operating margin increased 170 basis points to 14.8%. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental meeting in February, we were excited to announce the formation of the KaVo Kerr Group, which strategically unites our leading dental consumables, equipment, hi-tech and specialty brands, under one global platform and get our brands at the scale they need to better drive innovation, improve clinical outcomes and simplify workflows. Both customer and end-user reception since the launch has been very positive. Dental Consumables core revenues grew mid single-digits with broad based demand across all major geographies. Orthodontics, professional consumables and implant revenues all grew mid single-digits or better. During the quarter Kerr launched the SonicFill Dental composite system in China and Japan further expanding the products’ global application. SonicFill is the only solution that enables clinicians to perform cavity restoration in posterior teeth, with an easy-to-use single-step Sonic activated handpiece. SonicFill has already been a tremendous success around the world with more than 4 million sets shipped worldwide since the initial launch in the middle of 2011. Dental Technologies core revenues also increased mid single-digits with solid demand for our suite and imaging products. At the Chicago Midwinter Show we launched more than 20 new products including the DEXIS CariVu, a portable imager that pairs with our software and uses illumination technology to better assist doctors in identifying lesions and cracks in teeth. And finally the Industrial Technologies’ revenues grew 4.5% with core revenues up 3% and core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.5%. Motion platform core revenues improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, but still declined at a low single-digit rate. Strong sales in North American distribution was more than offset by a weak defense market and the impact of exiting certain lower margin product lines. We expect to complete that transition in the second quarter. We remain really pleased with the team’s execution on operating margin which increased more than 200 basis points from the prior year. Our Product Identification platform core revenues were up mid single-digits with growth across most major geographies. Videojet’s growth was balanced with mid single-digit growth in both consumables and equipment. During the quarter Videojet launched the 8610 thermal inkjet printer, world’s first TIJ printer specifically designed for fast drying ink enabling customers to print high resolution codes on non-porous surfaces, four times faster than other inkjet technologies. At ESKO, our suite of packaging management and design software grew double digit as the need for more efficient solutions across packaging workflow continues to build. ESKO remains the workflow management software provider of choice for brand owners with sales increasing more than 30% in this market. So to wrap up, we are off to a very good start in 2014 as our teams’ execution drove better than expected revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance. The Danaher Business System has helped build momentum across the portfolio by driving continued share gains and funding increased growth investments. We believe this momentum along with our robust balance sheet and confidence on the acquisition front position us well in 2014. We are initiating second quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $0.94 which assumes core growth comparable to the first quarter. We are also reaffirming our full year 2014 diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.75.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Debbie, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first today to Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Hi, good morning guys.
Lawrence Culp: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Congrats Larry on a great run. Also, just having the guts to make the decision, I mean, a lot of guys would sit around and kind of milk this job for a while. Obviously you are not doing that, so congrats.
Lawrence Culp: Thank you, Scott.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Is there any risk, I mean, how do you avoid with the change in 12 months out, I mean, how do you avoid 12 months of inertia here? How are guys going to think about deals? As this increase your – I mean, how does it change? I would be kind of awkward I think to announce the substantial deal and that passed on to Tom at this juncture. But is that the wrong way to think about it?
Lawrence Culp: Scott, I understand the concern, but I think that’s the last way we would think about it. Tom and I have worked together for 25 years. We have been both partners for over a decade. So I think that on the M&A front, Tom begins to be more a part of that conversation as we think about identify and cultivating pursuing targets. We wouldn’t chase anything at this point that Tom wasn’t fully brought into. But we do not slow down here at all in terms of what we want to do from an M&A perspective. I think that we got the time here to effect operationally, organizationally a very smooth transition and I am exceptionally confident that Tom, Dan, the rest of the team and I are going to be able to work together as we always have over these next several months during transition. Tom of course will be spending time with businesses that he doesn’t know as well, getting up to speed on some of the CEO duties that will be his come mark, but from an M&A perspective, I think it’s very much business as usual. And I have to go back – if you go back to my first year as CEO, I’ll never forget my first Danaher Leadership Conference where we announced three deals that week. So there is think precedent and confidence to suggest here that the transition no way will dilute or impede our activity on the M&A front.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Okay, fair point and I don’t know if Steve Rales is still there available for questions, if he is, I thought to ask one if he is available.
Lawrence Culp: He is here Steve – he is here Scott.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Okay, great and Steve, I mean, I guess, my question for you is, when Larry took over as you said it was a $4 billion revenue company, now it’s a $20 billion company, so substantially more complicated and quality is definitely a lot higher sure, but how is the mandate for Tom change, how – stepping into a, he is filling the seats of a guy who just had a five-bagger in market cap and 13 years that’s a pretty tough shoes to fill. I mean, how does the mandate for Tom change? How does the Board think about how this company grows from $50 billion of market cap to something that’s acceptable to shareholders in that same timeframe?
Steve Rales:  Thank you, Scott. I think the conversations about longer-term strategy and capital allocation are regular subjects to the Board. This is the Board that’s not unfamiliar with either of those. We'll examine the market as we always do. We have lengthy conversations with Larry, Tom, Dan and the rest of the team and we’ll continue to evaluate opportunities as we have for the last 25 or 30 years. We think it’s an exciting runway ahead, we’ve never been into better position from the balance sheet standpoint and I think there are plenty of opportunities that will be very exciting and I expect shareholders at the end of the day will be winners as a result.
Scott Davis – Barclays Capital: Okay, fair point. Thanks, Steve. Congrats Larry and good luck to Tom. Pass it on.
Steve Rales: Thanks, Scott, we’ll do.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: Hey, good morning.
Lawrence Culp: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: Congrats Larry. I echo with Scott’s comments.
Lawrence Culp: Thank you very much.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: How are you guys looking at the macro environment and maybe if you could just talk about specifically what’s going on in China and in Europe?
Lawrence Culp: Sure, I think that we were pretty pleased from a geographic perspective with the way things played out. Just maybe a word on the U.S. we saw – like a number of companies a slow start to the year, particularly in businesses where getting out every day is important whether that be on the diagnostics side all the way to – but we really, we are encouraged by the building strength during the quarter and the way we exited the first quarter and even way we’ve begun April here. Europe, third quarter in a row being positive, admittedly it’s up in low single-digits but that’s too has been encouraging just given the history. Our European leadership conference was held just two weeks ago and the mood there, Steve was buoyant as it’s been in several years. So we are optimistic there particularly with respect to life sciences, the dental side of things and TID our oral health position in Europe. China, clearly lot of headline concerns there. But we are pretty pleased to see double-digit first quarter with a bit better balance between our healthcare businesses which in the last few years have really led the way. Dental was up over 20%, LS&D up about 10% with the industrial businesses also doing better particularly in the environmental round. So we are going to watch China carefully, some of the other high growth markets that’s why we said back in December we thought the gap between the high growth markets and the development markets might narrow a bit that play out for us here in the first three months. But still very much the high growth markets in the pole position. So we like what we saw broadly around the world in the first quarter.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: And in the April you said, April was, how good as kind of April started and are you kind of assuming that do you know falls off here in the second half and you are consistent guidance for the second quarter, is there a comp issue in the second quarter with some similar organic?
Lawrence Culp: No, I think – we are really talking about a comparable core in the second quarter mindful that it’s still relatively really in the year, obviously a host of concerns out there in terms of the macro theme. I think if we look at the way the first quarter played out, we knew we were hurt by one less selling day particularly in consumables and probably helped a little bit given the Japanese tax dynamics. I suspect they wash, while we were thrilled with how strong dental Hach, VideoJet life sciences were relative expectations. We did have a choppy start in T&M, particularly in – and that's a space both with some of the mobile carriers and with some of our larger enterprise customers we want to watch carefully. So, I think comparable to the 3.5 we rung up here in the first quarter feels about right but we really like the exit rate in March and while it’s just a couple of weeks I’m encouraged by the start here in April.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: And then, one last question. Larry, I know you are probably, this is probably a dumb question, but I guess, in your mindset, are you still of the mind or you may spend some time with your family or this is kind of – do we take this you are kind of done with the large public company digs, I mean, are you going to take and are you kind of retiring? I mean, politics, have you thought about what the next step is at all, should we be surprised to see you resurface at another public company in a few years or it’s probably like you know a tough question answer obviously at this stage?
Lawrence Culp: But thanks for asking it. Steve, you know I am very fortunate given the great run that we had for a long time here that there probably hasn’t been a large public job that hasn’t been floated my way in the last six, seven years. But you see where I am. This is a great job. Tom, he is a lucky guy to have that opportunity here in a while. My view is, I am going to be full speed up until March 1 and then I am going to be in advisory capacity doing anything and everything that Tom wants me to do including get out of the way. But I am genuine and serious about wanting to do some other things. So while I would say never say never, I think I’ve had a pretty good job here and in this realm, it will be tough to be.
Steve Tusa – J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay, congrats to Tom by the way too.
Lawrence Culp: Thank you, Steve.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe – Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks good morning. Hate to sound repetitive, but congratulations Larry. And f you decide on politics I think the government could use some DBS methodologies. So, you think about that.
Lawrence Culp: Thanks, thank you Nigel.
Nigel Coe – Morgan Stanley: So, it sounds like March was stronger than Jan, Feb and it doesn’t feel like the weather had a big impact on your organic performance. I am wondering the impacts on consumables with equipment and whether that dynamic had any impact on your margin improvements during the quarter and how that maybe – shake up by segments?
Daniel Comas: Sure, Nigel. This is Dan. Good morning. Consumables were up 4% during the quarter which has been pretty consistent, maybe 50 basis points lighter than what we saw in the second half of last year. I think you could really explain that entirely by the one less selling day. I think what was really encouraging during the quarter was the equipment side. We were up 3.5%, that is the best number we posted in a number of quarters, balance stability it was the first, as Larry alluded to, better breadth in China. It’s the first quarter in a long time that all five segments were up in China. Healthcare was up more than industrial but again seeing some footing there. We were up 100 basis points in terms of core margin expansion. Some good improvement there, do we make a little bit more money on consumables and equipment we do but it didn’t really seem to impact margins at all during the quarter.
Nigel Coe – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just going back to the – it’s obviously a pretty healthy debate on capital deployments, PE seems to be pretty active, pushing up multiples to some pretty high levels. A lot of public companies that are out there saying they want to do more M&A. I am just wondering, is the environment tougher to deploy capital and then maybe just turning to that as well, what is the message on dividends? You obviously increased as four folds during the quarter, still a lot low in terms of pay out. But what is the message on dividends?
Lawrence Culp: Nigel, let me speak to M&A, maybe Dan will talk a bit to dividends. I think from an M&A perspective, there is no question that the environment given valuations first in the public market and the spillover effect in the private markets has been more challenging in the last couple of years, I think we have acknowledged that. But fortunately given the breadth of our portfolio and the inventory of markets we have an interest in, we don’t have to buy market indices, right. All we are really looking to do is identify and invest in discrete companies which we think are great fits with the Danaher portfolio and it’s really from that perspective that we are out talking to a lot of people really across the entire corporation about opportunities that we think would be glove fits for Danaher and for DBS. So, different environments are challenging in different ways, I don’t think that they – that we see private equity even with their resources being a primary competitor for us. It continues to be rare for us to see PE as the competition around an asset that we might cover. Clearly, the last several months have had some situations where we’ve been mentioned in combination with private equity, but largely around assets where our interest was partial not full. When we have strong interest in an asset in its entirety, I think we have great confidence in our ability to carry the debt. Dan?
Daniel Comas: Nigel, on the dividend, it’s like the increase we know it’s still relatively modest, it represents at $0.40 a share would represent about 10% of our free cash flow per year. So we are not trying to signal anything there. The strong bias is still very much M&A and expect that to continue. But it does create another vector to return some capital to shareholders.
Nigel Coe – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you very much guys.
Lawrence Culp: You bet, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Larry the accolades are going all year, I'll just echo them. We’ll miss you.
Lawrence Culp: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Good luck. I just want to come back again, maybe, approach M&A again to the question that Steve Rales is still there and to take another one. You have kind of unique position with your involvement with full effect also obviously and they do seem to be able to get that done over there. And I guess it does brings the question, is it simply a law of large number of dynamic that has come to bear as it relates to Danaher? Is there a need eventually to revaluate the portfolio or think of a new leg to open another vector for capital deployment? Do you think a question of size only has the ability to kind of perpetuate the business model?
Steve Rales: Thank you, Jeff. But first let me say yes, I am a shareholder of Colfax Corporation, full stop. Second, going back to what we talked about earlier, our Board has a very long view and our objective is to continue to try and find the way along with the management to make our businesses better and add value for shareholders. It’s an evolving process. It’s an ambulatory process. We are constantly looking at M&A, there is a certain vicinity if you will to the law of large numbers but we think more about opportunities and making our businesses better. Truthfully, Larry and Dan do a very nice job of communicating the company’s view on M&A, so I would defer to either them on the question.
Lawrence Culp: Jeff, I would just add that, we really don’t think beating a $20 billion revenue based company, a $ 50 billion market cap in anyway get in the way in terms of doing M&A. I think it’s just the opposite. At every step along the way as we’ve gotten bigger and in terms stronger, we’ve had more degree to freedom, we’ve had more – more capacity to do the things that we think really build an outstanding company over time witness Beckman Coulter. If you look at the way we’ve run M&A on a daily basis, it really starts with all the strategic platforms which would be great mid cap companies all by themselves if they were stand alone entities and it’s really that family of mid-cap companies working their market’s funnels around competitors, distribution, technology, bolt-ons that maybe of interest in addition to the adjacencies which give us the bulk of our flow around the smaller transactions that you see. The team here in Washington, which I think is outstanding. It’s really the group that targets the new space with the larger situations which naturally are going to be less frequent and at times more meaningful decisions this year amount of capital deployed. So I don’t think that while we have great respect for Steve and the team at Colfax, we don’t really think that there are lessons there that will help us deploy the next eight plus billion in capital we intend that will build out our companies.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: All right, fair enough. Just a quick one for Dan if I could. You did get a number of small deals currently in the first quarter, can you give us an idea of how many transactions were in there and what the average valuation was?
Daniel Comas: Jeff, we closed five acquisitions in the quarter which was an increase and we are seeing actually an increase around small deals which hopefully will be a positive sign about potentially getting something bigger done. Spend about a $160 million so relatively modest. A mix, some of those are businesses that are relatively low margin today, but it will come in as bolt-ons or create opportunities on the margin side, so those are all situations where we think we can get a 10% return, exceed 10% within three years.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: All right, thank you very much and good luck Larry.
Lawrence Culp: Thanks, Jeff. I’ll still be around a while.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker – Sanford Bernstein & Co: Thanks, good morning and obviously, I’ll echo that congratulations Larry, fantastic.
Lawrence Culp: Thank you, Steve.
Steven Winoker – Sanford Bernstein & Co: So, hey, since you are a student of Thomas Jefferson, I can’t help, but recite one of his quotes right delay it’s preferable to err on the capital deployment side, you didn’t say that second part, but, it’s a great quote and I understand that sort of how you are thinking about it. Is that $8 billion still the right number, I should be thinking about?
Daniel Comas: Steve, it’s Dan. I mean, clearly if you look at the balance sheet, the breadth of our, the quantity of our free cash flow, you can pencil out a larger number that until we obviously get some deals done aside, I think we will stick with the $8 billion.
Steven Winoker – Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay and Dan while I’ve got you, since we are in this period where M&A is a lot smaller in terms of reviewing the portfolio right now, the – where can ROIC go and I am just assuming that there is a continued delay for a little bit of time and how do you see ROIC kind of playing out in that event?
Daniel Comas: Well you’ve been seeing at 50 to 100 basis point increase in annual ROIC, given that we’ve had fewer acquisitions. I would be happy to see that stop for a little bit. We’d bring in some larger ones but, I think if you look at Q1 I think representative of last year, up 3.5% core growth and earnings up 8% we are getting I think good relative performance on the top-line and good margin expansions along with it and that's obviously increasing our overall returns.
Steven Winoker – Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay and sir if I could add one more just on the earnings side, the dental strength that you guys had was a surprise to me anyway. What do you really attribute that to? Is it sort of product, market, or what can you identify kind of that and give us a sense for the sustainability, or you just think it’s sort of a lumpy demand and we just have to be like this quarter?
Lawrence Culp: Steve, I think if you look both at the consumables versus technologies divide as well as the look around the world, the strength was very broad based. I don’t think they continue at that rate. We did get a little bit of help from Japan given the VAT increase. But it was once said dental is a mid single-digit grower, strong imaging and digital franchises and technologies, and while they are rarely home run products in consumables we had a wonderful wave of products launched at Midwinter. The team continues to execute better both in the U.S. and in Europe while China clearly is a concern for a lot of folks, our dental business continues to do very well there. So, again I think we probably come down a little bit from what we saw in the first quarter but dental ought to continue to be a contributor to it for us as we go through the year.
Steven Winoker – Sanford Bernstein & Co: Okay, great. Thank you.
Lawrence Culp: You bet, Steve. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan – Nomura Securities: Good morning guys.
Lawrence Culp: Good morning Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan – Nomura Securities: Congrats Larry. Great job and really happy for you. Good luck with the next part of the journey but we will have you around for a while. Hey, you mentioned, speaking it being around for a while, you mentioned wanting to get some things done before you leave, I mean, are there any sort of big things on that checklist that you think you want to make sure you get done before you hand it off?
Lawrence Culp: I’d like to write a few more checks before I go.
Shannon O'Callaghan – Nomura Securities: Okay, so, it’s mainly M&A focused anything other than that sort of that internal initiatives or other things that you feel like you want to bring to posture now?
Lawrence Culp: Well, I think a lot of our internal initiatives are around the high growth markets, around what we are doing in terms of taking full advantage of the web, what we are doing increasingly at a platform and regional level is work that we won’t finish when Tom hands. This is the work that Tom and I and the rest of the team has been engaged in together for some time. Tom and I will be dividing and conquering over the next year and that’s where I’ve been focused and we’d expect to continue to be focused. Clearly, getting the team ready as well, as they assume the new and additional responsibilities will be part of – of where I’ll be focused. But also just making sure that Tom's ready. I can vouch now from experience that this is one of the more meaningful transitions that you have as an operating leader. Tom is more than capable, but we want to make sure he is just tuned all the way up come March 1 to be ready to go as I know he will be.
Shannon O'Callaghan – Nomura Securities: Okay, thanks. And then, you’re seeing some of these other encouraging trends across the businesses/ where do you think the tech instruments business is at this point? You had some of this military government pressure that’s one vertical, but maybe talk across the others and where do you think that is and what’s it going to take to get going?
Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that we will take this stability that we are seeing in some of the larger tech verticals like computers, communications, semi and alike. The broader distribution business has actually been decent, but again because of the gov dynamics particularly in the U.S. here at the start of the year which we saw – I know some competitors have spoken to, puts us in that flattish zone. We’d like to thin k we see a little bit of an uptick from there but don’t anticipate necessarily a pronounced spring back at Tektronix through 2014, but gradual improvement.
Shannon O'Callaghan – Nomura Securities: Okay, all right thanks a lot guys.
Lawrence Culp: Thank you, Shannon.
Operator: We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse
Julian Mitchell – Credit Suisse: Congratulations. I just had a quick question on broader one test and measurement really. If you look at the organic growth in that segment, the last ten quarters, it’s about 0.5%. I just wanted to know something with the portfolio you needed some major work in – or it’s just a function of sluggish macro factors?
Lawrence Culp: Julian, thank you. Relative to your question, I think you really have to look at the segment in two halves, the communication platform has really been a nice performer for us, particularly around the mobile networks build out that we’ve been a large part of. We think that opportunity that challenge is to keep up with the explosion in bandwidth demand that we are all generating which will be with us for a while. Soft start to the year in network security, but as you know the last couple years, that’s been a strong performer for us and we are optimistic that it will return the type of performance as we go through the year. But on the instrument side, Fluke has had a tough goal of it, particularly in places like China where there is the slowdown in the industrial factor has been particularly pronounced. At Tektronix we just spoke to that a moment ago with Shannon, I think those dynamics are well known. But we are encouraged by Fluke here putting up another quarter of positive growth. We really like these new products that are coming out and a review just last week with the commercial team I really liked what I saw in terms of the launch plans for the second quarter and the second half. So while Fluke is unlikely to be a high single-digit grower for us any time soon we think we get Fluke back here to a more normal low to mid single-digit range as we go through the course of the year and while tech will be challenged we build on that stability and hopefully get them back to growth as we go through the year.
Julian Mitchell – Credit Suisse: Great, thanks and then life sciences, the last couple of years, each year you had large expansion about 150 BPS each year, Q1 was up 50 BPS, life science is larger, is that kind of the run rate going forward just because I guess most of that savings is now been squeezed out?
Daniel Comas: Julian, we were – core margins are up about 75 basis points in the first quarter. So there was a little bit of acquisition noise. Life science was stronger than diagnostics, and again I think diagnostics, their shipments were up low single-digits that was – we believe largely impacted by one less day. If you look at their orders, they were up mid single-digits. So I think that’s encouraging. That creates a little bit of negative mix just because if the incremental sales of consumables is at higher margins. So I think you will see continued very good margin performance and expansion in the segment.
Julian Mitchell – Credit Suisse: Thanks, Dan and just lastly on the CapEx, I think you talked before about low mid single-digit CapEx increase this year, Q1 was up lot more than that. Do you change the full year or it was just (inaudible)
Daniel Comas: Well, it’s coming up in part because of increased placement at Beckman, because of our leasing model. That shows up in CapEx. So some of the increase in CapEx is less traditional PPV, it’s actually expanding our installed base at Beckman which is obviously a good sign for the business.
Julian Mitchell – Credit Suisse: Great, thank you very much.
Lawrence Culp:  Thanks, Julian. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we will take our final question today from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard – Jefferies:  Thanks, good morning.
Lawrence Culp: Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard – Jefferies: Larry, could you elaborate on what you saw from an order perspective at Beckman understanding weather and one less selling day were headwinds, but given your comments about win rates in the U.S. when do you think that we see that translate into a core revenue inflection in the Beckman diagnostics unit?
Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that, we did a bit better from a bookings perspective and again better in bookings than we did in shipments. But the trend through the quarter was positive for us in that regard primarily with consumables but that North American equipment comment that we made, we think it’s significant, because it’s really the combination of so much of the work the team has done the last several years. As you know, it will take a while to get those orders converted into new boxes on the floor and in turn see that consumable stream. But we think that as we move forward sequentially through the course of the year that we will see a pick up as a result of those as increased wins here in North America, done unlike what we are sitting already in terms of early benefits from the return of the component to our whole suite of analyzers. So it will be gradual, I wish it was more rapid, but we will take the early indicators here of progress and then we can build on the print through the course of 2014.
Brandon Couillard – Jefferies: And then just one for Dan, operating cash flow is a little soft even excluding the discrete factors from last year. What’s your operating cash balance for the year and how quickly would you expect the timing dynamics from the first quarter to normalize?
Daniel Comas: I think, you are seeing on an improvement here in Q2 as Larry alluded to given the stronger shipments in March relative to the first few months that hurt us a little bit from a timing perspective on CapEx but I think that will shortly reverse itself.
Brandon Couillard – Jefferies: Okay, thank you.
Daniel Comas: Thanks, Brandon.
Lawrence Culp:  Okay, thanks everybody. We are around all the day for you to take follow-ups.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s conference.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 2013 was a good year for Danaher. For the full year, revenue increased 4.5% to $19.1 billion, with core revenues up 2.5%. Using the Danaher Business System or DBS, our team delivered solid core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow performance for the year. In addition, our new product development and go-to-market investments drove relative outperformance in many of our businesses. In 2013, we believe we increased our market share positions at Hach, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, AB SCIEX, Leica Biosystems, Kerr, Implant Direct and Videojet. Our focus and commitment to long-term growth investments position us well for 2014 and beyond. Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 3.5% organically. All segments grew at or above expectations, led by our Communications, Water Quality, Diagnostics, Dental Technologies and Product ID businesses, each delivering mid-single-digit core growth or better. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets improved notably from the third quarter and grew at a high-single-digit rate. In China, sales increased high-single digits, with continued strength in Dental, Water Quality, Life Sciences & Diagnostics. High-growth markets now represent more than 25% or approximately $5 billion of our annual revenue, up from $2.7 billion just 3 years ago. In the developed markets, the U.S. grew low-single digits and western Europe was slightly positive for the second quarter in a row. In 2013, we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, and our free-cash-flow-to-net-income ratio was 113%. This represents the 22nd consecutive year in which we delivered free cash flow in excess of net income. We also strengthened our businesses through acquisitions and deployed approximately $1 billion on 14 strategic bolt-ons in 2013 despite the tougher M&A landscape. Given the breadth and depth of our strategic platforms, we remain confident in our ability to deploy our $8 billion of available M&A capacity in a strategic yet disciplined way. We continue to deliver solid margin performance even while funding long-term growth investments. Our gross margin was 51.5% and almost 52% excluding productivity and efficiency initiatives in the quarter. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.1% and our operating margin was 17.1%. In the fourth quarter, our core operating margin increased 100 basis points while our reported operating margin declined 40 basis points to 16.9%, in part due to the impairment of certain intangible assets in our communications platform. Absent this charge, our reported operating margin would have been 17.5%. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $0.96, inclusive of approximately $100 million of productivity and efficiency investments, which we believe will provide about $75 million of savings in 2014. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.42. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 4%, with core revenues up 4.5%. For the full year, revenues increased 1% while core revenues grew 1.5%. Core operating margin expanded 150 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 16.6% due primarily to the previously mentioned impairment charge. Core revenue in Instruments increased slightly. Fluke core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate, an improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year, with demand strongest in the high-growth markets. Of note, Latin America grew in excess of 25% due in part to our increased commercial investments there. Also contributing to the step-up in growth was the successful launch of our Ti400 thermal imager, a wireless high-performance infrared camera with laser autofocus capability that enables service engineers to quickly detect temperature measurements up to 1,200 degrees Celsius and communicate results back to their laptops or smartphones for further analysis. Products introduced in the last 2 years are helping increase vitality at Fluke and accounted for nearly 1/4 of Fluke's fourth quarter revenues. At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly as strength in Western Europe was offset by weakness in U.S. government and computer verticals. In December, Electronic Products magazine named our PA4000 Power Analyzer its 2013 Product of the Year. The PA4000 is the only T&M instrument so recognized, and is an advanced power-testing tool that helps electrical engineers perform critical current measurements with precision and accuracy. Core revenues in our Communications platform increased low-double digits, with broad-based growth across most of our product categories. Sales of Tektronix Communications network management solutions increased more than 20%, driven by demand for mobile service providers in the U.S., Asia and Latin America. Arbor Networks ended the year with record bookings, driven by its Pravail enterprise security solutions and the recent launch of Arbor Cloud, an integrated on-premise and cloud-based DDoS protection service. During the first quarter, Arbor will extend into the advanced persistent threat market, leveraging the security analytics technology of Packetloop, a company we acquired last year. Close [ph] at Fluke Networks' recently released TruView network, an application performance monitoring software, grew significantly as enterprise customers looked for faster, more efficient ways to monitor network performance and troubleshoot problems. After a slow start to the year, we were encouraged by Fluke Networks' mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second half. During the quarter, Tektronix Communications acquired Newfield Wireless. Newfield's software provides mobile service providers with a visual representation of their network's performance, including call detail, traffic hotspots and usage data. This technology, combined with Tek Comm's network management expertise, will enable providers to optimize their networks and maximize their subscribers' mobile experiences. Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 10%, with core revenues up 3.5%. For 2013, revenues increased 8.5% while core revenues were also up 3.5%. Core operating margin improved 80 basis points, with reported operating margin down 50 basis points to 22.5% due primarily to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, with a double-digit increase in high-growth markets and solid demand in the North American industrial market. Hach had its best quarter of the year, delivering growth in all regions and major product lines. The business again grew at a double-digit rate in China due in part to heightened government investment in conservation and municipal water quality projects. ChemTreat had another outstanding quarter, and it continues to gain share as our best-in-class field engineers deliver exceptional service and demonstrate the value of our solutions to customers. As we highlighted at our Investor Meeting in December, development of our sales team in Latin America remains a key priority for ChemTreat, where we have doubled revenues in the past 3 years and grew more than 30% in the fourth quarter alone. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate, driven by payment, point-of-sale and environmental solutions. During the quarter, we introduced Insite360, a cloud-based platform that allows retailers to remotely configure and monitor their dispensers, inventory and point-of-sale systems from any PC or mobile device. Insite360 helps retailers identify theft, detect environmental issues and prevent fuel runouts in real-time, thus improving the economics and risk profiles of their businesses. Earlier this month, we acquired Outcast Media, a leader in digital out-of-home advertising for the retail petroleum market. Outcast enhances our point-of-sale product offerings and combined with Gilbarco Veeder-Root's Applause TV, will help advance promotion delivery designed to grow convenience store sales and enhance drivers' fueling experiences. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 3.5%. For the full year, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 4%. Our reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to 16.7%. Using DBS, we have been able to improve margins while also expanding our long-term growth investments. During the year, we increased spending on commercial and innovation initiatives by approximately $120 million. In our Diagnostics platform, core revenues grew mid-single digits for the fourth quarter in a row. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core sales grew at a low-single-digit rate, with strength in immunoassay and clinical automation, particularly in high-growth markets. Clinical automation sales were up double digits as Beckman's best-in-class automation capabilities help customers improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce labor cost. In China, we grew revenues approximately 20%, driven by a combination of our expanding installed base and continued government investment in health care infrastructure. 2013 was an important year of several milestones at Beckman as we resolved many of our remaining regulatory challenges, including FDA clearance for troponin on all of our immunoassay and integrated chemistry systems, while continuing to improve quality and delivery. Though it's still early, we are beginning to see the impact of the troponin clearance, as both our retention and competitive win rates have improved since September. During the quarter, we introduced a new Vitamin D assay in Europe and Australia for our immunoassay platforms and also obtained U.S. FDA clearance for the next-generation beta HTT assay, which is used as an early pregnancy test. Today, we're positioned better than ever to focus on retaining and winning new customers and to more actively increase growth investments in the business. Radiometer's core sales were up high-single digits, with growth in most major product lines and geographies. High-growth markets grew mid-teen, with China leading the way. Our instrument installed base continues to grow, with placements of our AQT point-of-care immunoassay analyzer increasing more than 50% and our blood gas instruments up high-single digits in 2013. We believe this momentum positions us well for outperformance in 2014 and beyond, as we benefit from incremental consumables revenue. Leica Biosystems saw broad-based growth, with sales up high-single digits. All major geographies grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better, with strength in Japan and the Middle East. Advanced staining revenues increased approximately 20% while core histology sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate. We had a record year in the advanced staining franchise, with net instrument placements increasing at a mid-teens rate and believe we are still increasing market share. Core revenues in our Life Sciences platform grew at a low-single-digit rate, led by the high-growth markets. Sales were up more than 20% in the Middle East and double digits in Latin America and Western Europe. AB SCIEX core sales grew low-single digits, with strength in proteomics and applied markets. AB SCIEX continues to broaden its global reach, opening a new R&D center in Singapore during the quarter, AB SCIEX's first outside of North America. The center brings development and manufacturing closer together while providing localized support for our Asia Pacific customers. In addition, AB SCIEX opened a new technical support and regional office in Dubai to better serve customers there in the Middle East. As expected, Leica Microsystems' core sales declined at a low-single-digit rate, primarily as a result of a difficult prior year comparison due to the highly successful launch of the SP8 modular confocal microscope last year. Orders grew double digits in the quarter, with confocal microscopes up more than 20%. We are confident that Leica will return to growth here in the first quarter. Turning to Dental, revenues for the quarter and full year increased 3.5% while core revenues increased 3%. Operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 13.7% due in part to the negative impact of sales mix as our technology businesses grew faster than our higher-margin consumables businesses. Spending on productivity initiatives and on targeted growth investments for new products set to launch in 2014, including 25 new introductions next month at the Chicago Midwinter show, also negatively impacted margins in the quarter. For the full year, operating margin was 14.6%. Dental consumables' core revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate as demand for implants was partially offset by a decline in professional consumables. We continue to have tremendous success with our digital dentistry initiative. Since its launch in June of last year, we have sold more than 300 Lythos Digital Impression Systems, which, in turn, helped drive record order growth in our Insignia orthodontic case starts during the year. Insignia's digital treatment planning tailors custom-fabricated brackets, wires and aligners to each aspect of tooth movement, thereby decreasing office visits and treatment time while improving the patient experience and clinical outcomes. Dental technology's core revenues grew mid-single digits as double-digit core growth in North America and China was partially offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our new digital imaging solutions continue to be well received in the market, particularly our new i-CAT FLX 3D digital imager. Since the launch in the second quarter of last year, we've sold more than 200 units, the equivalent of more than 1 per day. Additionally, KaVo's DIAGNOcam, a handheld radiation-free digital imaging scanner, won the German innovation prize for most innovative equipment product in dentistry in a survey of more than 4,000 German doctors. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 3%. For the full year, revenues grew 3.5% while core revenues declined 0.5%. Our core operating margin increased 20 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 17.3% due primarily to increased spending on productivity initiatives and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Motion core revenues decreased at a mid-single-digit rate as growth in industrial automation and North American distribution was more than offset by a decline in our defense and engineered solutions verticals. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in orders, which turned positive in the fourth quarter, for the first time in a year. However, we anticipate core sales will remain negative in the first quarter of 2014 as Motion exits some lower-margin businesses. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, led by high-single-digit growth in our core marking and coding businesses. Videojet had its best quarter of the year, with strength in all major geographic regions. Consumables revenue grew at a double-digit rate as our marketing initiatives and successful product introductions over the past several years have helped expand our installed base. In Esko and X-Rite, our innovation investments are helping accelerate growth, with new products representing nearly 20% of total revenue in 2013. One of the most exciting new product introductions is PantoneLIVE, a cloud-based color management solution that helps brand owners accurately communicate color specifications across their entire supply chain, improving the consistency of their brand image. During the quarter, Asda, one of the largest supercenter chains in the U.K., became the first retailer to implement PantoneLIVE. So to wrap up, as we anticipated when we were with many of you last month in New York, we had a strong finish to the fourth quarter, contributing to a solid year for Danaher. Our team's commitment to and application of the Danaher Business System drove relative top line outperformance, solid core margin expansion and excellent cash flow throughout the year. We believe the investments we have made to drive long-term growth and productivity, combined with our robust balance sheet and optimism on the acquisition front, leave us well positioned to outperform in 2014. We are initiating first quarter diluted EPS guidance of $0.76 to $0.80 and reaffirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $3.75. We anticipate approximately 3% core revenue growth in the first quarter, which will be impacted by 1 less selling day than the first quarter of 2013.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Marquita, I think we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nigel Coe with MS.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Good solid end to the year, Larry. Can you maybe talk about January? I know January is a fairly weak month for the quarter. But maybe just talk about 3% in the context of what you've seen so far in January.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think you're exactly right, Nigel. It's hard to say too much about January, given the nature of the month and how early it is. But I think we were particularly encouraged by the way 2013 ended, right? From a geographic perspective, the strength was broad-based. I think the same can be said from a line of business perspective. We probably had a better book-to-bill than we had the year prior, and I don't think there were any unnatural acts that, by and large, occurred. So it was just good to see that sort of strength come into the new year. I don't think we've seen anything in January that would deter us. Again, we mentioned in the formal remarks that we are short a selling day, which will impact us probably more so in consumables than in equipment. We know that Motion is still going to be exiting some of the low-margin business there. But I think all-in, we feel good about things. But when we say approximately 3%, I think we know that we clearly need a few more weeks behind us here to have a better bead on the first quarter. But so far so good.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. That's great. And then, even though no one extrapolates or prorates the [ph] amount, but given the 7-day pressure in 1Q, given that Motion is still going through the rationalization of the product lines, does this point us towards the higher end of that 2% to 4% for the full year, Larry?
H. Lawrence Culp: For the year?
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I don't think we're going to change that 2% to 4%. But clearly, getting off to a good start here in the approximately 3% range would at least put us at the midpoint. And if the macro scene is better, Nigel, I'm highly convinced we're going to do well, right? With our exposures from health care to industrial, environmental, networking, an improved global scene will be very good for this portfolio, and we'll execute accordingly.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then switching to margins. And I just wanted to begin with Industrial. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that productivity initiatives was one of the reasons why we saw some pressure there. But I'm just wondering, are we seeing any pricing pressure within industrial markets?
Daniel L. Comas: Nigel, it's Dan. First of all, if you just normalize year-on-year restructuring, Industrial Tech margins were up 80, 90 basis points. We had a higher -- we had some additional opportunities. We took advantage of it. In terms of pricing, it hasn't -- we definitely saw an impact probably late '12, and we've seen that continue, where we're not getting any pricing in equipment, generally speaking. So we're still getting the kind of pricing you'd expect on the aftermarket. But the period of the prior year, you're getting a point or so on equipment and instruments. It hasn't gotten worse, but since about a year ago, it's probably overall kind of flattish for us right now.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Could you expand on the write-down on the Communications platform, talk about maybe what that investment was about, I think, and typically, how much you capitalize in R&D and sort of think about it from an investor's risk profile going forward? Just a little more perspective there. Was it acquisition related at all or pure new investment and why?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I'll start and maybe let Larry chime in. It was investment in a company, relatively early-stage company, that is continuing to perform reasonably well but behind the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition. Because of that, the accounting rules indicated that a write-down of a piece of the purchase price was appropriate. So obviously, we took that. Obviously, the Communications platform, overall, has been a very good, very kind of high return for us. Probably, there'll be a little bit more risk. And you can have situations like Arbor that play out well ahead of schedule. This one, we still believe in. It's tracking okay, but it's a little behind versus where we thought it would be at this point.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Steve, that's it exactly. I would just add to that, that we do a number of these things, these sorts of investments, to augment our competitive positions really around the portfolio. And while you never want to see an impairment, to have that business up double digit, contributing is a good thing and a good thing long term. You look at a small investment that we made, that was really to seed core [ph] technology for Lythos, the digital impression system we have up and running at Dental. We did something similar that was really the foundation for what became AQT at Radiometer. So we have a number of these small bets that we make that we don't really end up talking much about. As Dan alluded to, a moment ago, clearly, with the accounting rules, we've got to call this out. But I think it's just really part of the mosaic in terms of the investments we make organically and inorganically to drive long-term competitive strength and profitable growth.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And since we're talking about that segment, what's your sense for the sustainability of that low-double-digit growth in tech -- Tek Communications, I mean?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think we're in a very good spot there, clearly, in terms of the challenges we're helping our service provider customers solve, as well as the folks on the enterprise side, right? Network management, particularly with the mobile explosion, is a continuous challenge. We're well positioned there. From an enterprise perspective, network management, generally, it does not get easier. Clearly, a day doesn't go by with the cyber security headlines being rewritten. So we like where Comms, we like where Arbor, we like where Fluke Network is positioned. I'm not sure we consistently sign up for double-digit growth there. The Tek Comms business can be a little bit lumpy, but I think we like the long-term trajectory there to be sure.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just turning to margins. On the Dental side, a little more color on the restructuring and growth investments there. What -- a little more sense maybe for the nature of that.
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. I think maybe just a little bit of context. As we hinted in New York when we saw you, I think we had a little bit better visibility at the end of '13 than we have the last couple of years. So we had a little bit more room to do some things, and Dental was one place where we took advantage of that envelope. As we said, about 100 basis points of costs that came forward. Most of that was on the productivity side, just to continue to sharpen up the cost structure there. But we're really in the sweet spot, both from a technical -- or technology perspective given where the product pipelines are, and a lot of that comes out in February at Midwinter. But also on the commercial side, we wanted to pull some things forward, particularly in Asia, all of which, I think, gives us a good start to 2014. And again, the mix bit of it was important as well. I think it's always good to see equipment show strength, but there is a little bit of a squeeze there from a margin perspective in the short term.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a couple of questions. Larry, just first on the deal front. Can you give us a little more color on where your comfort factor is? And the light in which I ask the question, you may or may not have had interest, but we saw a couple of health care deals trade away in the quarter. Roper, yesterday, was saying a couple of things slipped through their fingers that others took at 20x EBITDA. It still sounds like a very tough market to actually get things done.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think we'd be the first to acknowledge that, over the last 4, 5 quarters, things have become more difficult in general. But I think our optimism, Jeff, is genuine because we're going to pick through a number of different situations that populate the funnels really across each and every platform. And as we do that, even in this environment, we think there are opportunities for value creation. We're going to stay disciplined, no doubt about that. I think that we take some encouragement from the fact that we did deploy $1 billion last year across, admittedly, 14 smaller transactions. But as Dan and I look out there, as we go through the monthly reviews we do with the businesses, I think that we're well positioned financially and operationally to put that capital to work. But on the margin, you're spot on. So it is a little tougher, given the valuations, particularly in the public arena than a year ago.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So how do we think then about kind of Plan B, another deployment, if the deals don't materialize? And I was wondering also if Dan could maybe give us a little color, like collectively, what the acquired multiple was on those 14 transactions, kind of aggregated multiple and aggregated sales acquired.
Daniel L. Comas: Jeff, overall, about 3x revenue and kind of a low-double digit, 11x, and I may be off by 0.5 point kind of EBITDA sort of multiple. They are largely bolt-ons and tuck-ins, so our confidence with those tend to be higher just because of the nature of what we can do on the cost side.
H. Lawrence Culp: I'm just glad you didn't say it was 22x there. Jeff, the -- just back to Plan B. I think the board and certainly Dan and I and the team are highly cognizant of the earnings power that we have in what is an under-leveraged balance sheet, right? I think the bias that we have, which is discussed and frankly, reaffirmed at virtually every board meeting, is toward the inorganic investments that have worked very well for us in building a strong company and driving a lot of value. Things are going to come in ebbs and flows here, but I think that balance or that bias is intact. And we know that, frankly, just a few years ago, after a somewhat quiet period, we were uniquely positioned to go take Beckman on, right? So again, I think this is a live conversation with a strongly shareholder-oriented board at every meeting, but the pronounced bias that we have is one we continue to think works for Danaher going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I think you guys mentioned $100 million in restructuring and the $75 million in benefits. But I thought you said you did actually take some more here in the fourth quarter. Was that just offset with growth? Is there -- is that just rounding error? Or can you maybe quantify what you did in the fourth quarter and talk about where -- within which segments you did it in?
Daniel L. Comas: A lot of questions there. I'll try...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's basically fourth quarter restructuring. What was the absolute number and where did you have them?
Daniel L. Comas: So the absolute number was a little bit over $100 million compared to $120 million last year. It was higher in Industrial Tech and Dental, and it was lower in Life Sciences & Diagnostics. So if you look at the core margin expansion of LS&D, up 260, if you normalize restructuring, it'd be more like 150 basis points of core margin expansion. We spent a little bit more than $100 million in the quarter, but you could also see that where we -- we also really stepped up some of our growth investment. So R&D was up 13% year-on-year in the quarter. It'd been tracking up around 8% or 9% through the first 9 months. Sales and marketing, a similar story. We're up 9% in the quarter versus tracking maybe 6% or 7% for the first 3 [ph] quarters, as I already alluded to. Given where we saw some of the strength, there was an opportunity to deploy some money that hopefully will benefit growth in the future.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So it's really -- because that $100 million, I don't think that's necessarily new, relative to what you said in the third quarter. I was under the impression that you had a little bit of revenue upside in the fourth quarter, so you invested some of that away. But I guess what you're saying is you invested that in -- it's reflected more in growth investments as opposed to productivity.
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. I mean our R&D itself was up $40 million, almost $40 million in the quarter. Our run rate would have suggested more like $30 million.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. Just on -- the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margins were very strong. What is Beckman now doing? And what do you expect for Beckman margins next year?
Daniel L. Comas: We -- for the full year, mid-teens, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter, though that is somewhat seasonal. But as I mentioned to Jeff, with a little lower restructuring, very strong performance. We're trying to get away from talking specifically kind of Beckman, but it's a big piece of the segment and we would expect that segment to again be one of the larger contributors to the year-on-year margin expansion here that we expect in '14. So things are tracking well. More costs are coming out. Very pleased with how the year trended in terms of their Beckman margins.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And sorry, one last one, just on the day sales thing. You said it's mostly -- obviously, mostly hits in consumables, so that's a higher-margin issue. Is there any way to kind of quantify the EPS impact of that or at least the profit impact of that?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, if you just assume 1-day impact on consumables, no impact on equipment, probably just a little bit, but that would be 0.5 point of growth. 0.5 point of growth on $5 million (sic) is $25 million and that's a 50% fall-through, that costs us a $0.01, $0.015 in the quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Larry, a couple of the businesses that have been tougher, I mean, Motion you talked about orders turning positive in the quarter. Tektronix, I guess, is still down a little bit. Can you give a little color on what you're seeing there? I mean, is that flattening and turning positive dynamic, just a comp issue? Or are you seeing things actually get better there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. No, I think at Motion, we were particularly pleased with the finish, especially on the industrial automation side. If you look, we were up basically at a mid-single-digit rate in industrial automation in the quarter. Now that's a portion of the business, but that's really where a lot of our growth investments, from a product and a go-to-market perspective, have been made, Shannon. From a vertical perspective there, it was broad-based. Orders were up double digit in the fourth quarter in the U.S. I think, in China, we finally had traction from an execution perspective. So there's a lot there, frankly, that we're quite pleased with on top of the multiyear margin expansion that, that team has put forward. At Tek, not necessarily thrilled to be down again in the fourth quarter. But I think as we look forward, given the historical lag effect around PMI, we're optimistic that we return to growth here in '14. Things have been a bit bumpy, as you know, there. I think the China space, particularly on the export side, has continued to be particularly challenging. But I think all in all, Tek did a much better job from an execution perspective in a tough environment in 2013. I think we held ground broadly and are poised to get back on the positive side of things here in the new year.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then for the whole company, do you have what equipment and consumables each grew in the quarter? And just maybe any commentary on what you make of that in terms of customers' willingness to invest?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think that's -- actually, I mentioned this earlier, Shannon. As you know, the book of business here is about 60-40, 60% equipment, 40% consumables, and where we've really seen the sustained growth of late has been in consumables. And we thought -- when we talked about as a 2.5% core in the fourth quarter, we thought consumables would lead there. We'd be slightly positive on equipment, with consumables at a mid-single-digit rate. To see consumables, basically, come in line but to have equipment come in a couple of hundred basis points better than that, I think it's another one of the signs that we can take from the fourth quarter to say this broad-based geographic and product pickup that we saw came in equipment, and those are clearly more important decisions, if you will, on the part of many customers. So we're going to look at that, to see how sustained that is as we get started here in 2014, but I think just that snapshot is one that's hard to interpret in anything other than a positive way.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Crédit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In Dental, you discussed some mix issues in Q4 and some new product spend. But I guess if I look at the year as a whole, the margin was about flat. How are you thinking about the mix items into 2014? I mean, do you think we should see Dental incrementals pick up much or this is something that could persist?
Daniel L. Comas: Julian, I think you saw an improvement through the first 9 months of the year. Again, the fourth quarter was impacted primarily by the higher restructuring, but as Larry indicated, kind of the mix, with the equipment better than consumables. So given we have a little higher restructuring spend here in Q4, we expect a significant number of new product launches in the first half of '14, I think that bodes well not only for the top line, but also for margin expansion here in '14.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then within Life Sciences, you had a 40% incremental operating margin last year as a whole. Is there a sense in which I guess a lot of the easy or early savings from Beckman have now been squeezed out and so you should see incrementals normalize pretty quickly this year?
Daniel L. Comas: They'll come down a little bit, but even our Radiometer and Leica Bio businesses, just given the high consumable content there, also continues to be very good even in the "more mature businesses" in terms of their tenure with Danaher, still seeing good fall-through. But it won't be probably at the level we saw in '13.
H. Lawrence Culp: Julian, I would just add to that, that if you look at the productivity investments that we made in the fourth quarter, LS&D still accounted for about 1/3 of the overall total, as Dan noted earlier, down year-on-year, but still an important part of that spend, which I think speaks to just the visibility the teams have on opportunities. Beckman's not the only relatively new business we have there. So they're all keen to get after it to continue to get those margins up, again, because we think that segment ought to be a 20%-er.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just lastly on the kind of your own investments outlook. SG&A to sales was flat last year. Do you think that stays sort of flattish this year? And just any color on your CapEx assumptions for the year.
Daniel L. Comas: It should be. I mean, we make -- as I mentioned, our sales and marketing were up 6%, 7% for the year, and we did a good job partially because of the '12 restructuring, actually having our G&A down a little bit. A fair amount of the restructuring in Q4 was also targeting after G&A here in '14. So it probably climbs a little bit given the continued investment in sales and marketing. From a CapEx perspective, we are roughly teed up for kind of a low- to mid-single-digit increase in CapEx, kind of PP&E type CapEx.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On Motion, I might have missed this, but could you size for us the revenue impact on the businesses that you'll be exiting in 2014? And maybe share with us a little bit about what the tipping point might have been. What's the decision-making as to, to exit those businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I'll let Dan answer the first part of that. I think, with respect to the second part, it was really, really simple. I think these were below-margin opportunities we've gotten a hold of that looked a little bit more attractive at a distance than they did up-close. So effectively -- as you know, Dean, we've had a multiyear effort to put a premium on margin expansion in Motion. I think we give the team very high margin in that regard. And the walk from the revenue, even though it impacts the print on the core revenue side of things is the right thing to do, and the team has been at that for the better part of a year now.
Daniel L. Comas: Deane, so we were -- Motion was down mid-single digit in the quarter. Absent the businesses we've exited, it would have been down low-single digit, probably down 1 point or 2. We expect that dynamic to continue here in the first quarter. They're just getting better so we're going to have about a 4- to 5-point hit on growth from the exit of the business, but it should be largely completed -- we have a little bit in Q2, but basically largely completed by the end of Q1.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, good. That's helpful. And then, on China, the 20% up, was that an overall clinical or was that at Beckman in particular? And maybe some color on there in terms of what the mix was. Are these China-for-China products? And maybe a little bit about what kind of business you're seeing in China in Beckman.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I would say that if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics today and I'll throw Dental in there as well, we're clearly beneficiaries of this China-wide infrastructure build in terms of better clinical delivery. We see that in the Diagnostics businesses, we see that in Dental and as well, from a research perspective, both at SCIEX and at Leica. We are still, I would say, Deane, in the early innings of driving the localized product agenda that I'd like to see us execute upon in that segment. Now we do have a pretty good Asian manufacturing footprint there. A good bit of that is actually in Singapore. You heard me reference in the prepared remarks the AB SCIEX footprint in Singapore. Leica Micro enjoyed a similarly substantial position there. So we have work to do there. But frankly, as these researchers and clinicians often return to China from their overseas educations and postings, they're looking for the same sort of gear. And in turn, I think that's why you've seen Beckman and Radiometer, Leica and SCIEX do so well in China the last several years. Is that helpful?
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, it is.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First one on Dental. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what you're seeing in the underlying patient volume trends in the U.S. and then maybe what's baked into your assumptions for patient volumes this year.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well I think that we certainly know that, from a macro perspective, patient volumes have been, of late, more sluggish than we've seen over the last 10 or 15 years, particularly here in the U.S., Western Europe to a slightly lesser degree. But I think our view, Isaac, as you well know, is that we really want to drive innovation, couple that innovation with better commercial execution so that we can capture that value that we're adding on a per doctor, per operatory, per patient basis. And I think we've been doing that, lots of examples. Most recently, this digital dentistry initiative at Ormco, I think, is one where we're getting a lot of traction in that regard. And to the extent that we can do that, that drives share, that drives value capture and coupled with what we're doing in the high-growth markets, I mentioned China a moment ago, we think Dental can be a good sustained mid-single-digit grower for us.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe switching over to T&M. You mentioned some of the investments you're making on the software side of the business, which I would assume is going to carry higher margins over the long-term. So if we assume that the capital equipment side of T&M remains a little sluggish, is it fair to say there'll be enough mix shift here on the underlying business to move the needle on overall margins in the segment?
Daniel L. Comas: Maybe on the margin, Isaac. But it's a 20% segment and while some of the software businesses can carry higher gross margins, they also carry some higher investment levels. I think it's probably more about driving growth there than margin expansion.
H. Lawrence Culp: Right. And that's 1 segment, Isaac, where the variable margins on the equipment are well above the Danaher average. So we don't get as much of a pronounced mix there between core equipment and aftermarket, in whatever form it comes, as we might elsewhere, i.e., Dental, as was explained a few minutes ago.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just last one, if I could sneak it in, on the M&A side. Just given your earlier comments, can you talk a little bit about where you think your funnel is strongest or maybe weakest for M&A by segment?
H. Lawrence Culp: I would say it's pretty well balanced at this point, Isaac. As you know, we've been working the Environmental side of things pretty hard. That's an area where we'd like to do more. There are certainly spots within both Industrial Tech, particularly around Product ID, as well as in T&M, particularly if we can lever the Fluke brand more broadly, that are high priorities for us. So we're working those hard, but I don't mean to shortchange LS&D or Dental. They certainly have a good bit that they have their eyes on as well.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a question on cash flow. I think free cash flow was flattish versus last year. And as we look at 2014, do you expect a pickup in cash flow? We just need to transition after we sort of digest M&A to a more sustainable percentage of net income, which sort of means cash flow, is likely going to be a flattish for another year?
Daniel L. Comas: Andrew, the impact in 2013 was really not a lower -- it's not explained by lower M&A activity. It's a little bit of -- I hate to sort of hide behind this, but a little bit of an accounting dynamic. As you know, we sold both our Tools joint venture and about half of our Align shares. We brought in close to $1 billion from those 2 activities. Those things were below the free cash flow line. However, the $175 million -- $150 million of taxes we paid on those gains negatively impacted our free cash flow. So if we didn't have those 2 discrete items, our free cash flow would have been up $100 million year-on-year.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And what should I think for '14 then?
Daniel L. Comas: I mean, I think if you adjusted for that, we'd have close to 120% conversion. Amortization alone gets us 15 points of conversion. So something in that zone would be probably a reasonable guiding estimate here for '14.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got you. And you said between 115% and 120%?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, something in that zone.
Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then the question on M&A. As you look at the opportunities, do you think it's easier for you to do deals in sort of $1 billion, $2 billion size? Or do you have an advantage looking at larger deals given the fact that you can extract synergies, you get to keep them and so the economics changes quite a bit, you being a strategic buyer versus the...
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think regardless of deal size, each investment requires a certain level of work. I think we've done large deals, a la Beckman. We've done some smaller transactions. But once you get past that dynamic, I think we feel pretty confident that both, given the size of our financial capacity, and again $8 billion of capital here in the near term, coupled with our operating capabilities, both in terms of the quality of the team and the Danaher Business System, we are advantaged. And that doesn't begin to address the fact that we take a long-term view, right? And we can not only be patient, but we bring that owner's mentality to building out the business and harvesting those top and bottom line synergies. So we've been at this a long time and continue to believe that our organic strategy will complement what we do organically very well and create value for shareholders and build a sustainable franchise along the way.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: On the Industrial Tech business, maybe a little more color on kind of really what you're thinking on core growth in '14. I mean, Q4 this year was the best -- was the only positive quarter of the year, the best 1 in 4 quarters, and you still have some of those businesses that really aren't going to be strong growers, at least in the first half of '14. So just maybe a little more color on where you're seeing kind of a growth expectation on core for '14.
H. Lawrence Culp: Charlie, what we said -- as you recall, what we said in New York is we thought, for the full year, Industrial Tech would be up 1% to 3%, probably a little bit more of our cyclical exposure there. So if things spring back just broadly, I think we're well positioned. Maybe the industrial automation performance I highlighted a moment ago suggests we're beginning to see some of that. But I think, by and large, what will drive Industrial Tech, aside from some of the headwinds you mentioned, is the very strong performance we have seen and expect at Product ID. Videojet, Linx, the marking and coding business have done very well the last couple of years. We love what they're doing in terms of finding opportunities to invest in growth and their execution around those investments. And while it's still early, at X-Rite and to a degree, Esko, those businesses both play important roles in managing some of the more complex supply chain and brand management challenges that our customers, particularly in consumer goods, face. So there's just -- it's a ripe field of opportunity. The businesses are well positioned, and they ought to lead the way this year.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: We'll be around -- thanks everybody for joining us. We'll be around all day for follow-ups, if you need anything. Thanks.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Another very good quarter for Danaher. Our team continues to execute well, taking advantage of the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core growth, margin and cash flow performance. Revenues grew 5.5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3% while currency translation decreased revenues by 0.5 point. The investments we've been making in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives, particularly the rapidly expanding digital world, are driving growth and share gains across many of our businesses. Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Leica Microsystems and Videojet are among the businesses that we believe increased their relative market share this quarter. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew mid-single-digits. China delivered low single-digit growth led by our Dental, Water Quality and Life Sciences & Diagnostics platforms. Most of our industrial businesses continue to see sales declines in China. Developed markets improved sequentially from the first half of the year, while year-over-year, Japan grew mid-single-digits, the U.S. was up low single-digits and Western Europe was slightly positive. Our gross margin was 51.9% and gross profit improved $145 million. This increase, along with our holding G&A essentially flat, allowed us to grow our combined R&D and sales and marketing investments faster than our sales growth rate. We delivered outstanding margin expansion this quarter with our core operating margin increasing 110 basis points and reported operating margin improving 30 basis points to 17.4%. Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 139% in the quarter and we're still driving towards $3 billion of free cash flow for the full year. We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. During the first 9 months of the year, we closed more than $850 million of acquisitions, primarily in our Environmental, Industrial Technologies and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. We've had a number of constructive conversations with companies across all of our growth platforms and remain confident in our ability to deploy the $8 billion of potential M&A capacity available through 2014 in a strategic yet disciplined way. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement core revenues were flat as growth in our mobile tool distribution business was offset by modest declines in both our instruments and communications platforms. Both core growth -- both core and reported operating margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of targeted growth spending, including the expansion of our network monitoring systems for next-generation LTE networks and our DdoS security offerings for our enterprise and service provider customers. Instruments core revenues declined slightly. At Fluke, core revenues were flat as increased demand for our industrial products in the U.S. and Western Europe was offset by pockets of weakness in certain high-growth markets. Fluke has generated more than $100 million of revenue from new products introduced since the beginning of last year, including additions to our power quality thermography and calibration lines. These new products, along with productivity and cost-reduction initiatives, helped drive more than 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. At Tektronix, core sales declined slightly as low single-digit growth in developed markets was more than offset by weakness in our China export business where we primarily serve the technology sector. Communications core revenues declined at a low single-digit rate as strong demand for security applications in North America and Western Europe was more than offset by a decline at our network management solutions business in the same regions. Encouragingly though, bookings were up double-digit in the quarter and we expect core growth rates to accelerate in the fourth quarter. New products introduced within the last 18 months, including Arbor's Pravail enterprise security software and Fluke Networks' TruView network performance monitoring solution, accounted for more than 25% of the total third quarter platform revenue and are steadily building momentum. During the quarter, Arbor closed the acquisition of Packetloop, a developer of big data security and forensic analytics used to provide enterprises with enhanced advanced threat detection during cyber attacks. Packetloop's capabilities complement Arbor's Pravail and Peakflow products, further extending our DdoS-centric solutions toward a broader suite of advanced threat analytics. Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 10% with core revenues up 4.5%. The segment core operating margin improved 60 basis points with reported operating margin down 80 basis points due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform's core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, in part due to an improvement in North American municipal project activity at both Hach and Trojan. Hach has now seen 3 sequential quarters of U.S. municipal spending increases. Sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate. Trojan's orders were up high single-digits due to several large wastewater project wins, including the city of Chicago, one of several large U.S. cities now deploying UV technology in their treatment facilities. At ChemTreat, we continue to grow faster than the market and achieved another milestone as quarterly revenue surpassed $100 million for the first time. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, led by demand for our payment solutions, which grew more than 25% in the quarter due to significant customer wins in Asia and Australia. During the quarter, we expanded our highly popular Encore product line with a new compressed natural gas dispenser, which allows us to help retailers capitalize on the growing trend toward alternative fuels while also delivering superior safety features and seamless monitoring. In the quarter, we acquired Teletrac, further building out our smart transport business. Teletrac complements the previous acquisition of Navman Wireless by providing increased access to the U.S. market and key verticals, including long-haul trucking. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues increased 10.5% with core revenues up 6%. Core operating margin was up 285 basis points, while our reported operating margin decreased 200 -- while our reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to 14.7%. Core revenues in Diagnostics grew mid-single-digits. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core revenues were up low single-digits with growth in all major product lines, particularly clinical automation and immunoassay. We've seen low single-digit core growth or better for the last 6 quarters and the business is becoming more competitive each day. As many of you know, during the quarter, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Access troponin assay for use on the DxI series of immunoassay systems. This clearance marks an important milestone for our customers and the Beckman Coulter team. For the first time since 2010, Beckman can offer the troponin assay to existing and new customers in the U.S. for use on all of our immunoassay and integrated chemistry and immunoassay systems. With both troponin approvals received and many other regulatory and quality improvements made, we're better positioned to focus on retaining existing and winning new customers and to more effectively and actively increase growth investments in the business. We've launched several significant new products in the last year, including the AU 5800 and the DxH 600, and are investing in new product development and menu expansion to boost product vitality and ultimately, drive higher organic growth rates. Radiometer's core sales increased at a low single -- at a low double-digit rate. Sales in high-growth markets were up more than 20%, led by China, which grew in excess of 35%. AQT, our cardiac care breakthrough, also had another terrific quarter, growing more than 30%. At Leica Biosystems, core sales increased approximately 10% as advanced staining and core histology sales both grew low double-digits. Increasingly, we are finding opportunities to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. In this quarter, we had several meaningful wins as a result of the integration of our core histology capabilities with our advanced staining solutions to simplify overall pathology laboratory workflows. Core revenues in our Life Sciences platform grew high single-digits with solid sales in most geographies, particularly Japan, China and Western Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew high single-digits, led by particular strength in pharma and in applied markets. The 6500 Triple Quad continues to build momentum and has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its launch last year. AB SCIEX continues to expand its digital capabilities with multiple new and enhanced launches this year, including its new MasterView Software, which allows the mass spectrometer to be used for routine analysis in food safety, environmental and forensic toxicology laboratories with minimal training needed for lab personnel. This is just one of the many new applications introduced this year that simplify workflows and enable greater efficiency and cost savings for our customers. Of note, today, approximately half of AB SCIEX R&D associates are dedicated to software development, with nearly 1/3 of the total R&D spend focused on these digital efforts. Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-teens, with sales of our confocal microscopes up more than 30%. Our SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope has generated over $150 million of revenue since its launch last year and continues to be very well-received. We're very proud of the fact that all 3 winners of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine cited Leica microscopes in their publications during the period in which they carried out the work that contributed to their awards. This is the third year in a row that Leica microscopes have been cited in Nobel Prize-winning work in the field of physiology or medicine. We're pleased to support such important and pioneering work. Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 4.5%, while core revenues were up 3.5%. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points and reported operating margin increased 60 basis points to 16.1%. This marks the first quarter Dental segment margins have exceeded 16%, evidence of our team's ability to drive and sustain improvements. Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single-digits with solid demand in most geographies and product lines. In particular, we saw outstanding traction in our implant business, growing over 20%. Revenues from products introduced during the last 18 months have doubled since the first quarter, as adoption ramps for our new products, including the Lythos Digital Orthodontic Impression System and our TF Adaptive endodontic file. KaVo core revenues increased low single-digits as double-digit growth in the U.S. was partially offset by weakness in project business in Western Europe. During the quarter, KaVo launched the DIAGNOcam, a handheld, X-ray-free digital imaging system that uses light technology instead of radiation to provide doctors with unsurpassed imaging quality. In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 1%, while core revenues decreased 1%. Due to a weak top line, core operating -- or despite a weak top line, core operating margin expanded 100 basis points and reported operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.6%. Motion core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate. However, we have seen improvements in the North American industrial automation and distribution markets. We've also had commercial success with several new design wins, including a contract from a major material handling company for critical motion control capability worth over $15 million annually at full volume production. The team's execution on the margin front has been excellent, as operating margin increased more than 100 basis points from the first 9 months of the year. Motion continues to transition out of some of their lower-margin business, negatively impacting sales performance in the short term but positioning us for better and more profitable growth longer term. Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were flat as mid-single-digit growth at Videojet and X-Rite was largely offset by a significant nonrepeating consumer electronics laser order last year, which created a difficult prior year comparison. We believe the investments we've made in digital marketing lead generation and in innovation at Videojet, combined with our expanding commercial DBS capabilities, continue to drive relative outperformance. We're now deploying the same lead gen growth tools to many of our other businesses. During the quarter, Esko announced their first acquisition as part of Danaher, acquiring CAPE Systems, a software developer that specializes in packaging design, pallet optimization and truck and container loading solutions. This acquisition expands Esko's capabilities to provide an end-to-end offering to its packaging customers from packaging design all the way through to point of sale. So to wrap up, our team continues to execute well with the Danaher Business System, delivering solid core growth, operating margin expansion and cash flow performance. We believe our new product and go-to-market investments, our continued focus on productivity and efficiency initiatives and our optimism on the acquisition front position us well for the balance of 2013 and beyond. We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $0.91 to $0.96 and confirming our full year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3.37 to $3.42. We are assuming fourth quarter 2013 core revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3%.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Debbie, we're ready to take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a question on the acquisition pipeline. Obviously, a big topic of debate in the last couple of months, there's been a lot of noise around you guys perhaps switching up your capital allocation philosophy, given the lack of deals that's coming. And maybe you could talk about the discussions with the board around a potential for a buyback. If no deals get done, what's kind of the tipping point for that? And then also just kind of the standard discussion around what the pipeline looks like. And it has been a little bit of a long period of time since you guys did a big deal. So I mean, it is a fair question, I guess, so if you could just comment on that.
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, all your questions are fair, but we're very pleased with the health care performance. You're exactly right. To see Life Sciences up mid-single, certainty on the Dental consumables as well, the Diagnostic businesses to boot, very pleased with that. But remember, we had water up mid-single-digits. GVR was in that zone as well and Videojet, particularly. So we had a number of businesses in mid-single-digits or better in the quarter. So a lot of folks contributed. But to your question, capital allocation is something that the Danaher board takes quite seriously, as you imagine. I think they understand that, that's a critical responsibility they have relative to the company. And clearly, we had a bias, a distinct bias over time toward M&A. What we've been able to do organically has thrown up a lot of cash. And what we've done is redeploy that back in a way that has complemented what we're doing organically, inorganically, to build what we think is a unique and outstanding portfolio. I think that bias, Steve, is very much intact today simply because while we have tremendous capacity, we talked about $8 billion over the next couple of years potentially, we see a wealth of opportunity. And again, the quality and the quantity of the conversations that we're having with potential partners, with potential sellers, is something that we find encouraging. There's no question that given where public equity valuations are in many spaces, M&A is more challenging at this point in time. But those valuations again can be a catalyst, a trigger, if you will, for the types of conversations that we're having. I think that when we meet again in December as we did when we met in December, the board will talk through all of the options that we have to build value, including buybacks, including the dividend. But that said, I think the bias that we have is, one, we have a tremendous amount of conviction in despite the fact, as you say, that while we've deployed $850 million this year, we haven't had a big, big deal since Beckman.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Is this a dynamic around people's EBITDA expectations? Or is it more about what you talked about with the valuations? I mean, what's the sticking point here? Because it seems like you guys have been pretty optimistic on the pipeline several times in the last several quarters, it just seems like there's -- for whatever reason, stuff is just not getting to the finish line. Is that a fair characterization? Or is this just kind of normal course of business?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, I think it's more normal course. Clearly, for a host of macro reasons, valuations in a number of places are probably a bit ahead of the fundamentals, right? And we're going to be more rooted on the fundamentals and we're clearly in a slow-growth global scene with, despite last night's news or this morning's news, a great deal of uncertainty out there. So that doesn't make it easy necessarily. But again, it's hard for me to characterize or generalize the 1 reason or the 2 reasons that some of the things that we have been working on haven't come to a head yet. But again, I think that each situation is unique. We don't need to have a broad array of sellers out there. We simply need to have a handful of folks that we'd love to have part of Danaher get to a point where we can both be happy around the terms of the transaction.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: When you look at Test & Measurement, it's the one area that has remained pretty sluggish all year and shorter-cycle businesses that clearly are showing that global economies aren't improving at all. I mean, what are your guys telling you from the different geographies, particularly when you think about China still negative on relatively easy comps? I mean, is there any hope that we see a pickup towards the end of the year? Or is this the new reality, I guess, in global?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think if I can take the last part of your question, elevate it up and out of T&M and just look at the world more broadly, we clearly have seen a bit of the edge come off the high-growth markets. That said, they're still leading the way for us, as you know. I think we were pleased to see the U.S. be -- well, U.S. and Western Europe to be better incrementally. But for the high-growth market basket to be up, say, mid-single-digits plus as opposed to low double-digits is something that we wish were otherwise. But the macro is what it is. Scott, specifically at T&M, I think what we saw in the quarter is important to understand if you look business-by-business. The comms business had a really good quarter from an orders perspective. They were up double-digit. But as you know, in that space, deliveries can be a bit lumpy. And I think that's really where we were a little soft, vis-à-vis our expectations. But the order strength that they had sets us up well going into the fourth quarter. And we think the comms business is probably going to be up somewhere in the high single-digit range in the fourth quarter. So I'm not really worried about that. On the instrument side, I think we were actually pretty encouraged by what we saw. I mean, Tek was down slightly as was Fluke. But for Tek to be down slightly, that frankly is the best quarter we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2011 and very much in line with where we thought they would be as they work through some of the macro issues that you're alluding to. Fluke was in a similar position and really because outside of China, we saw the high-growth markets tail a little bit. India, Turkey, Russia were softer than we had anticipated. China, fortunately, was positive, at a low single-digit rate unfortunately, but still an acceleration, slight acceleration from where we were in the second quarter. So all in all, I think we were pleased with the way the quarter played out because, as you know, instruments has really been where we've been challenged. And it was really that comms dynamic that was a little softer than expectation. But again, it sets us up well for the fourth quarter.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. So when you think about 4Q guidance, 2% to 3%, kind of sequentially flat against a slightly easier comp, I mean, is there an impact in there? You didn't mention government shutdown in any of your comments. I've got to imagine there's some NIH or CDC impact for the first couple of weeks of October. Is that in your guidance?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, it's a little hard to pin down. We didn't use the backup script we had if things didn't happen as everyone hoped they would last night here in Washington. But we've seen a little bit of sequestration impact in certain pockets, a little bit in LS&D, a little bit in T&M. And I think we've dialed that in. But to the extent that there's any residue from the circus over the last couple of weeks, we know what we know today, right? And I don't think it gets materially worse, given they found a way to a deal last night.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So I'm not sure you answered the question. Was there any real -- you couldn't measure any impact in NIH or CDC shutdown? Or is it....
Daniel L. Comas: Scott, I would say, generally, we did see some pockets of weakness in government in the third quarter, probably saw a little bit more in the industrial businesses. Even though it's not a big piece of Fluke and T&M, we definitely saw the impact. We are expecting a more difficult fourth quarter in Life Sciences compared to the third quarter. I think that's the combination of a couple of things. One was we had a terrific quarter Q4. We had a very tough comp here in Life Science. And I think there's a little concern about the residue of what's happened here the last couple of weeks. So part of the reflection, we did overall as a company have a better core growth last year in Q4 than we did Q3. And that was probably most notable in Life Science, and we'll feel some of that headwinds here in Life Science in the fourth quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just maybe, first, a cash flow question. Free cash flow net income was a very strong 139% but still down from last year. And I guess, some of that was trade working capital headwind, by my numbers, something like $40 million to $50 million. But maybe just talk to any dynamics there we should be aware of.
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, there are a couple of factors driving the cash flow being a little bit behind last year. One is the timing of tax payments. We've had higher year-to-date tax payments than a year ago. That should flip a little bit here in the fourth quarter. But as you point out, there's also some working capital dynamics. Last year, in our comms business, we had some sizable upfront payments on some projects. Not surprisingly, those are harder to get these days. It's a little bit of a one-off there in terms of deferred revenue. And then on the inventory side, we have had a -- I would talk to this, a sizable increase in kind of new products this year. That has impacted our inventory levels, which are a little bit higher than they were at this time last year. We expect some of that to correct here in the fourth quarter.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. All right. And then I noticed also the debt paydown, you've got -- I think it was down by about $650 million. Was that -- just any part of that a function of your discussion about capital deployment and sort of optimism but just not there right now? Or how should we think about that?
Daniel L. Comas: I wouldn't read anything into it. We had a Eurobond come due in the third quarter and we had cash on hand and we redeemed it at that point. And obviously, the capital market is still wide open here, so not concerned that if we were to run down some larger deals, we'd have any issues with financing.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then finally, the M&A that you talked about, I guess it was $869 million year-to-date for $294 million of revenues and a little more in this past quarter from a price, so kind of running 3x revenue for the year and, I guess, 4x for this last quarter. Just thinking about, these are small deals, lot of strategic deals. But that normal kind of pricing run rate on historical last 12 months' revenue -- or sorry, last year's revenue is not normally what we should be thinking about or expecting, right?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes. I mean, I wouldn't read much in from the bolt-ons in terms of what they would mean for larger situations. Some of these are very profitable niche add-ons or businesses that we expect to be very profitable companies becoming product lines within the operating structure.
Operator: We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes. So can you just maybe talk about -- elaborate a bit on the trading environment? Some of your peers have talked about a September slowdown. Did you see that? And then secondly, on emerging markets, we've seen some of the consumer staple companies caution on EM. And you've seen the slowdown but still at decent growth levels. But is there anything happening in emerging markets that maybe causes some concern down the road?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think the way September played out, Nigel, was more or less as we had anticipated, frankly. I think as we went through the summer, we knew we'd have a lot riding on September. Certainly, pleased to see Europe go positive again, albeit ever so slightly. I think in terms of the high-growth markets, we saw China up again low single-digits in the quarter, but we saw a little bit less froth in other high-growth markets but still positive, right? So if you look overall, I would've thought that given some of the macro issues that we might have seen a little bit of greater spottiness in Brazil and India. They're both up 15% for us despite the ForEx issues there. And Russia was up mid-singles for us. So I think we're probably more incrementally cautious about how much growth we will get from the high-growth markets but continue to believe that they'll lead the way here going into the fourth quarter and as we gear up for 2014.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. That's great. And then switching to troponin, obviously great news that you finally got approval on the high-speed machine. But can you maybe just talk about what benefit you expect to accrue from having that assay on the high-speed machine and maybe back away from that and talk about what negative impact you saw from the absence of that assay for the last 3 years?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. Well, I think in terms of the impact, clearly that was a test that had a run rate in the $40 million to $50 million range at peak before we acquired the company and before they got into the issues from a regulatory perspective. I think what it really means for us going forward commercially is that we can go back and sell that assay on any machine to any customer. And that's going to help us not only claw back what we can in terms of that lost revenue, but going forward, when existing customer contracts are up for renewal, there's no troponin issue to work through, that's solved. And when we're competing for new business as well, Nigel, that is not something that will be held against us. I think just as importantly from a product development perspective, the organization understandably spent considerable time and talent, let alone dollars, in paying off that inheritance tax, if you will. We get to pivot now with that behind us, putting those people and that money on more traditional growth investments, particularly in terms of menu expansion and complementary software and service capability. So it's a big deal for us commercially. It's probably even a bigger deal long term from an innovation perspective. And finally, as you can appreciate, having that successfully concluded is a tremendous morale booster for the team.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: No question about that. That's great color. And just one final question. Larry, you mentioned in the past, the midpoint mentality. And I guess, the question is, is there a bias towards any good news in 4Q being used for top-up restructuring? Is there a bias towards restructuring in 4Q?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, what we're going to do with the efficiency and productivity efforts in the fourth quarter is we will spend, I think, at this point, close to $100 million in the quarter and would expect that, that gives us a nice payback going into '14, probably in the $70 million to $80 million range. So we're going to top that up a little bit and probably use a little bit of the beat here to do that in part because we can and in part frankly because we should, given the uncertainties that still lurk out there. So I think it's a good setup for us going into the fourth quarter and getting ready for next year.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just putting a finer point on restructuring first, did any restructuring happen in Q3? Or is the $100 million plan all about Q4?
Daniel L. Comas: Jeff, the lion's share of it will occur in Q4. There were some early spending in Q3, but it was a modest amount.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Great. And just wondering on back to instruments and Test & Measurement, Larry, other than kind of lapping what should be some easy comps after kind of 18 rough months or so, do you actually see some clear business drivers to kind of drive some acceleration into next year, whether it's new product or customer or front log or any other thing that feels tangible to get some visibility on the outlook?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Well, I think the visibility really comes from the sales funnels, right? And those sales funnels and the issues and the opportunities we have, I think, are our best window there, Jeff. But I think if you look at the trend lines in terms of retention rates for existing customers, win rates for new customers, let alone that you have a punch list of some of the things that we needed to work through, be they regulatory approvals that we just talked through, product enhancements and the like, improvements in delivery and service, I think we just again are a more competitive company every day. And that, coupled with the lessons we glean from our higher-growth Diagnostics businesses, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, give us the confidence that we'll continue to see the sequential improvement in the underlying core growth at Beckman with the lineup we've got. Obviously, there's some longer-term growth drivers that kick in, in time, like our molecular diagnostics effort. But that's really not something that we're going to talk a lot about today. But we've got a long-term plan here that, I think, gives us again the confidence that Beckman is going to be a good grower for us.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Right. And can you elaborate a little bit more on the trends in U.S. muni? And it sounds like Hach is gaining some share. Is that how you'd handicap it? Or is the market actually gaining some momentum? Obviously, you've got some episodic projects that's going on that's helped.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think that we have seen a welcome stabilization and, dare I'd say, a modest improvement in the muni scene. And we see it both at Hach Lange and at Trojan. Is Hach taking a little bit of share? We think so. But as you know, Jeff, it's such a fragmented market. It's hard to pin down inside a 90-day period. But we clearly have the winning franchise in a number of product categories that are important, not only on the lab bench, but in the plant at Hach.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Larry, I was just sitting here looking at the overall business and looking at 2012. You grew about 2% core, 2013, about 2% core if you take your 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter. And I'm just -- from your perspective, where you sit, what are the key issues you see for Danaher moving into 2014? It looks like consensus expects revenues to bounce back to, call it, 5% mid-single-digit growth. I'm just kind of curious what you see as the key issues for Danaher moving into next year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, clearly, I think the macro context is important, Jon, not only for Danaher, but for all of us, right? But we can't control that. So we've just concluded our strategic plan reviews, which is really the front end for us to our budget cycle that we will begin here in a couple of weeks. And I think what we try to do is really make sure that with all of our businesses in the context of their respective markets, that we're very clear as to what winning looks like in '14. It's going to be a share gain play in a lot of places. We need to make sure we are grabbing as much high-growth market opportunity as we can come, even if those markets are a little less robust. We want to make sure we're continuing to drive everything we can from a digital perspective from the way we generate leads and sell to some of the new product and business model changes that are likely to occur, and all the while, I think, make sure that we're staying focused on the qualities of the delivery, the cost side of the business that has always been a DBS hallmark. So we take none of that for granted. That's our game plan really across the portfolio going into '14. And '14 will be what it is in terms of the context. We need to control our destiny as best we can.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Sure. And to your point, I mean, if you look across all your markets, clearly the markets themselves are just slower. But assuming a similar macro as we've had, I mean, let's just say that's what happens this year and next year, are those initiatives enough, you think, to drive you to mid-single? Or if we were in the same kind of macro, would you expect a similar kind of environment as the last couple of years?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think when we get to the other side of our budget cycle and we get to New York in mid-December, we'll detail out all of the assumptions for next year.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then if I could just follow-up then on the Test & Measurement side of things, it looks like at least for this year, kind of every quarter sequentially, margins are down a little bit. Were there any -- is that just a volume issue? Are there any plans specific to that business unit to restructure? I'm just curious kind of how you're seeing -- what your take on the margins are.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Jon, I think from a margin perspective, 2 key points. One, it is our highest gross margin business. So when a little bit of revenue goes missing in T&M, we feel it. I'd say the other, as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, we're continuing to invest in innovation, particularly on the comms side as we look at some of the LTE opportunities, as well as the expansion of the Arbor business beyond their DdoS core. We can't let the near-term dynamics get in the way of making sure we continue to invest in what has been, this quarter notwithstanding, really one of our best growth contributors in the last couple of years and a business that we think will be similarly positioned going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Larry, so this sort of encouragement you talked about a little bit in Tek instruments, can you give a little more color on your thoughts there? I mean, is this just finally the mass of the comps? Or are you actually seeing better spending out there?
H. Lawrence Culp: I don't want to pound the table too much, Shannon. Again, we were down, albeit slightly. But the comps helped a little bit. But you'd have thought that, that would have been the case 5 quarters into the slowdown, right? And again, we haven't been in this zone since the fourth quarter of 2011. China continues to be challenging. And I say China, I think it's really more the tech sectors that we serve with the export base there in China as opposed to China more broadly. But we saw, I thought, nice improvement in the U.S., good improvement in Western Europe and some of the other high-growth markets were contributing. But just given the vertical mix, when Tek is going through what it is going through, the Tek end markets, it is challenging for Tek in the short term. But I think, all-in, we were encouraged with the print and hope to build on that as we move forward here in the next couple of quarters. I don't think the context for them gets any easier, so we're going to have to work hard to get north of line and put a positive print on Tek.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then just you also talked about some of these better trends you're seeing on the Motion side, but it's being, I guess, more than offset by your transition out of the low-margin business. I mean, x this transition, would that business actually be growing right now? And when do you see that kind of working its way through in terms of this bleed-off of other stuff?
Daniel L. Comas: Shannon, instead of being down high single-digits, I think we would've been down just a little bit. We've had 3 quarters in a row where our book-to-bill has increased and we were north of 1 in the third quarter. Again, we've got 2 more quarters of this -- of the noise, getting out of this low-margin business. But I think the underlying trends are favorable right now.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And what are you hearing in terms of sort of what's driving that better trend?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think frankly the stability in the U.S. and in Western Europe has helped us a good bit there. I think we're executing better. We've reset the mix a bit across the group away from some of these more volatile end markets. That's been a multiyear effort. Some of the exits that Dan alluded to are around discrete customer situations. So I think there's a little bit of market help there, Shannon. But I think that the great work that team has done on margins that has been evident in virtually every print here in the last 8 or 9 quarters is also showing up in the quality of their revenue set. And that, in turn, is why we're getting a better top line once you kind of filter away the one-offs out of the group. A little bit more health care, a little less semi helps a lot in this environment.
Operator: We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Crédit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A question on Product ID within industrial tech. That piece, I think, it had sort of decent growth organically for about 3 years. It's gone flat in Q3, and the main reason seems to be consumer electronics. Could you talk about maybe what you've seen by region in the consumer electronics piece there and if you think that Product ID should return to growth in Q4 or that's more something that happens next year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. No, I think at PID, the issue in the quarter, Julian, is really the comp. We had a very large global consumer electronics opportunity a year ago. It was primarily a laser marking application. It was great to get. It's a little hard to offset in the quarter a year later. And I'd say that, coupled with the drupa show a year ago, really set Esko up for a very strong back half as the orders taken at drupa were shipped in the back half of the year. If you look at the core marking and coding business at Videojet, again, we were up mid-single-digits there. I think that business continues to perform very well, clearly the market leader. And the newest acquisition, X-Rite, was up mid-single-digits as well. So they're continuing to, I think, get their arms around the opportunity they have with DBS. So I realize the headline print isn't stellar, but it's frankly what we had anticipated happening and really have no concerns here around the core growth engines in PID as we move forward.
Daniel L. Comas: And Julian, we'll have a little bit of that laser overhang in Q4 and not near as pronounced as Q3 and we expect a better print here in Q4.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then on the cost base, you showed kind of very good operational leverage around R&D and SG&A in Q3. I mean, are the trends on the selling and R&D costs, are those more -- is Q3 more kind of representative of where you should be going forward relative to the performance in the first half, when maybe the cost growth seemed to be a lot bigger?
Daniel L. Comas: Julian, we -- R&D and sales and marketing continue to grow faster than organic revenue, but not -- it was not the same -- as you point out, not the same differentials we saw in the first half. As long as we're expanding gross margins, doing what we did on the G&A side, which was keeping it flat year-on-year, we're comfortable with that makeup because we think that's helping us drive some of this relative outperformance in some of our businesses.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then just lastly, you touched on this early, but sort of net income is up about $250 million year-to-date, free cash flow is down about $200 million. Was your point that in Q4 that gap is pretty much wiped out because of the tax and the comms issue? Or is it maybe something that spills into next year?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, part of the year-to-date income increases are onetime or so. The overall point is accurate, but it's not that significant. And we expect better free cash flow here than we had a year ago in Q4 because of the dynamics I covered.
Operator: We'll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Larry, on the Dental side of the business, just curious if you could speak to how Dental consumables have fared kind of over the past 6 weeks or so, given what's been happening in D.C. And then on the margin front there, could you speak to how much more runway you feel like is left on the profitability front in the Dental business?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think in terms of what we've seen on consumables in the U.S., as you well know, Brandon, it varies a little bit category-by-category. But we've been pretty pleased with the resiliency of what we have seen. Now what matters most obviously is POS in a number of the categories. And we don't really have up-to-the-minute visibility in that regard, given we go to market through distribution. But where we have that line of sight, it hasn't been, I think, as troublesome as the headlines out of Washington might suggest. In terms of the margin expansion with the business, again as we said, pretty darn proud of the progress the team has made on the margin front. We love the 16.1% print here. I think Dental can be a 20% platform or segment for us, really no reason for that not to be the case. We have work to do to expand the gross margins there. And that's work we're after, not only in terms of existing cost, but frankly new product design. And I think over time, there's leverage to be had out of the OpEx base. So I don't think in any way should you take this third quarter number as a high-water mark. It's a sign of progress, but there's more to come.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And then back on T&M, could you just give us the overall book-to-bill for the segment? And then particularly would be interested in how Tek instrument orders performed in the period.
Daniel L. Comas: Brandon, for the instrument side, our book-to-bill remained about 1.0. So orders were basically in line with -- shipments were down ever so slightly. I think orders were about flat but not a big change. As Larry alluded to, orders were very good at comms and we were well north of 1 for comms.
Operator: We'll go next to Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just some cleanup questions here. And for Dan, maybe if he can comment on the price/cost dynamic in the quarter and what you're looking for in the fourth quarter.
Daniel L. Comas: I mean, we continue to see good progress on the gross margin side. That's obviously a function of what we did last year in Q4, the benefit of some of these new products coming in at higher gross margin. Price, still pretty steady. We're getting the same price on the consumable side. Equipment remains challenging. It's definitely worse than it was, say, 2 years ago, but it's been pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the input side, we've done a good job on -- we've done a very good job on the procurement side this year. And you see that in what has been a low-growth environment, our gross margin up 60 basis points. And we've had as good a year as any on doing a better job on sourcing and procurement.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And we touched on this earlier in the call regarding plans for additional restructuring in the fourth quarter. Could you quantify any additional discretionary spending beyond restructuring? We touched on some incremental sales, R&D, maybe some other growth investments. Is there anything embedded in 4Q guidance in that area?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, as I mentioned to Julian, we continue to spend faster on those growth levers in our overall top line against driving margin expansion because of the gross margin and the G&A. And that continues to be our plan in the near term, and won't get any more specific than that.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Good. And then just last question for me, the news on the Chicago win for Trojan. I saw the announcement last week by the city of New York that they have completed the Trojan UV installation, that's the largest in the world. Is the Chicago win, is this an inflection point you've been waiting for, for drinking water, disinfection on UV? And are there other cities that we're looking at Chicago and New York to lead the way?
H. Lawrence Culp: Deane, it's a timely question, not only because we finished up in New York and Marv was down for the grand opening, so to speak. But with the Chicago win, we really get on the treatment side, a top 10 U.S. city deploying UV for the first time. So the application is a little bit different than New York. I think a lot of eyes are on Chicago. So we're keen to go from order to shipment and installation and get that gear installed. And I do think that will help us drive greater print penetration at the higher-volume sites or localities going forward. So it's a big order, which is great. But again, strategically, as you point out, probably more important to us going forward.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to talk a little big picture on Diagnostics. It's been an interesting sort of market dynamic. We've seen varied prints from some of your competitors, and it feels like your business is really sort of hitting an inflection point. So I'm just curious, from like a market perspective, there's a lot of pushes and pulls. Reimbursement is tougher, utilization is still a bit weak, but we're seeing platform consolidation, the emerging markets are good. You guys have had some good R&D success. I'm curious, as you sort of put it together, how the business is doing versus the market in terms of where it is on the plan versus what your expects were when you originally bought Beckman and how you kind of expect the R&D to kind of further accelerate. Do you feel like that business really is kind of now getting to where you want it to be? Is it doing better? I'm just trying to get a big-picture sense with all the pushes and pulls, how you feel like you're doing versus the market and where the big deltas are from an inflection perspective as we kind of go forward.
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. Ross, I think, overall, we're very pleased with the Diagnostics platform, not only because of where we are with Beckman, but the real performance driver, as you know, for us the last several years have been Radiometer and Leica Biosystems. Radiometer has just done a phenomenal job globally in critical care, both on the core blood gases and now in cardiac care. And that franchise is just a wonderful business. Leica Biosystems, similarly, we positioned in a bit of a niche in the path lab, has only plugged into the highest product growth category, advanced staining, but has done that in a differentiated way, given we really can go end-to-end in that workflow from our core histo products all the way to advanced staining, and now increasingly with Aperio, into some of the informatic applications. I think at Beckman, in terms of the top line and our competitiveness, we are where we hoped to be in the second half of 2013. We thought this would be a low single-digit growth year as we paid off some of that inheritance tax, not only from a regulatory view but frankly a lot of the internal issues that we needed to work through, quality, service and the like. But we really like where Beckman is today. And I think as we move forward, we're going to play a lot more offense commercially. We're going to be better-positioned from an innovation and R&D perspective, both with the instruments as well as the menu. And that may not ever put Beckman in short of a big impact from the molecular effort into the Radiometer, Leica high single-digit, low double-digit growth range, but Beckman can be a very solid mid-single-digit plus grower for us over time and certainly has still runway in front of us from a margin expansion view.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, just on that last point, it feels like again, like to your point, you're really sort of going on offense now, which is obviously encouraging. The natural next progression for the business over time, R&D-wise, I mean, there's still plenty of menu left within your own world, but it's sort of that push into molecular, which I know they had been working on and you've put money towards. I mean, I think, in general, that organic strategy has made sense. How do you feel about sort of transforming Beckman over time into kind of a broader player in Dx and using some of your existing assets around you to kind of round out the business as you sort of see where some of the valuations have gone in that space? Obviously, externally, it gets a little bit more challenging. But how do you feel like that sort of playbook looks today versus maybe what you had thought 6 or 12 months ago?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think we have been focused frankly, Ross, first and foremost, on making sure that Beckman itself is strong. But as we made the progress that I alluded to earlier, we have been doing more with Radiometer, with Leica Biosystems, to collaborate and do some things that we might not be able to do independently. Valuations run in cycles, right? And there'll be times when there are attractive opportunities for us to add to Beckman and to the Dx platform, and we'll take advantage of those. And as you saw with the IRIS investment, where we extended Beckman into urinalysis, we're at the point where we think the business is strong enough and capable to think about those sorts of investments in addition to what we're doing organically. So I think it's full speed ahead at Beckman.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, better-than-anticipated core revenue growth and outstanding execution from our team led to strong earnings margin and cash flow performance. Core revenue growth of 2.5% was slightly higher than expected, led by Hach, Gilbarco, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and our Life Sciences platform, all of which were up mid-single-digits. Investments we've made in innovation and go-to-market initiatives in the high-growth markets continue to drive growth and help us capture market share. The impact of the Danaher Business System and the quality of this growth were evident in the excellent year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. Our gross margin improved by $140 million or 100 basis points and our core operating margin expanded 95 basis points. As we look to the second half, we intend to make additional investments aimed at share gains and margin expansion for 2014 and beyond. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.87, a 3.5% increase compared to our diluted net earnings per share a year ago and representing another record quarter for Danaher. Excluding a $0.03 gain recognized in the prior year period, adjusted net earnings per share increased 7.5% year-over-year. Revenues increased 4% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 2.5%. The impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by 0.5%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew high single-digits. In particular, we saw sequential improvements in Brazil and the Middle East, as each region was up more than 15% year-on-year. China saw low double-digit growth in the second quarter, led by our Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments, which grew in excess of 20%. In addition, our Water Quality platform in China grew at a double-digit rate for the second quarter in a row. Developed markets were up slightly with the U.S. and Japan up low single-digits and Western Europe down low single-digits. Our gross margin increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 52.7%, driven by both volume increases and prior year-over-year productivity improvements. This significant improvement has allowed us to increase our growth investments while still delivering excellent bottom line results. Our reported operating margin in the second quarter was essentially flat at 17.8% while core operating margin improved 95 basis points. The Danaher Business System continued to serve us well, helping to generate yet another quarter of solid cash flow performance. Second quarter operating cash flow was $899 million and free cash flow was $763 million. Our free cash to net income conversion ratio for the second quarter was 124%. We continue to find attractive bolt-on opportunities and closed over $300 million of acquisitions in the quarter, focused in our Environmental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. Given our healthy balance sheet, we have more than $8 billion of potential M&A capacity available through 2014 to expand and strengthen our strategic growth platforms. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement core revenues increased 0.5%. Core operating margin decreased 30 basis points while our reported operating margin declined 60 basis points to 20.9%. In our instruments platform, core revenues declined low single-digits. Fluke's core revenues were flat with 10% growth in high-growth markets, offset by weak demand in most developed markets. However, we are encouraged by the mid-single-digit growth we saw in North American industrial instruments during the quarter. At Tektronix, core revenues declined low single-digits with growth rates in both developed and high-growth markets improving sequentially from the first quarter. Core revenues for our Communications platform grew low single-digits, led by strength in the high-growth markets, specifically the Middle East and Latin America. Across the platform, we've increased our R&D spending by approximately 15% year-to-date, focusing our new product development and innovation to address the expanding needs of our wireless and enterprise customers. At Fluke Networks, we unveiled the new product Versiv product family designed for copper and fiber certification during network installation. The DSX-5000 CableAnalyzer gives field technicians unmatched speed and efficiency in certifying performance in copper cables while the CertiFiber Pro provides the same certification capability for fiber networks. In Arbor Networks, demand for network security solutions remains very strong across all major geographies. During the quarter, we added over 50 new customers in both the enterprise and service provider markets, which include significant expansion orders at 2 large global financial institutions. As a testament to Arbor's innovation and leadership in network security, they were recently named the Best Overall Security Company during the Info Products Guide Awards at the RSA Conference. Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 8% in the quarter with core revenues increasing 4%. The segment core operating margin increased 70 basis points with reported operating margin essentially flat due primarily to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach grew mid-single-digits, driven by core lab and process instrumentation and mid-teens growth in service. We believe we are growing faster than the market. Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-single-digits in the quarter while China grew double-digits, driven by solid demand for drinking water projects. During the quarter, we launched several new products, including a value line of electrochem products designed to specifically for China. We also unveiled the 5500sc Silica Analyzer, which features predictive diagnostic software, allowing customers to avoid unplanned downtime caused by silica buildup on boilers and turbines in power gen stations. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single-digits, led by healthy demand across all major product lines in most major geographies. Sales in Asia and the Middle East were particularly robust, driven by large customer site upgrades for dispensers and payment solutions. We believe we are gaining share with our point-of-sale and payment products, both of which grew at mid-teens rates in the quarter. GVR recently completed the previously announced acquisition of Automated Fuel Systems Group, a leading provider of fuel management solutions to government, fleet and mining customers in South Africa. Moving over to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues increased 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. We saw outstanding margin performance with our core operating margin improving 180 basis points and our reported operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 14.4%. This strong margin performance occurred even with a double-digit increase in R&D expenses at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, where we continue to ramp up our product development efforts. The diagnostics platform continued their solid performance with mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter. At Beckman, core sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in all major product categories. This quarter marks the second anniversary of the Beckman Coulter acquisition, and we are exceptionally pleased with the progress that's been made by the team around the world. We've seen low single-digit core growth or better for the last 5 quarters and the business is becoming more competitive each day. Over the last 8 quarters, we've made significant improvements in our internal capabilities, specifically addressing on-time delivery, service and product quality through improved design to ensure that we're serving our customers well. We've also made tremendous progress to enhance efficiency with second quarter operating margin expanding 150 basis points year-over-year. We've also made considerable progress on the regulatory front. For example, we recently received FDA 510(k) clearance for the troponin assay for use on our Access 2 system. This approval allows Beckman to offer troponin to new customers in the U.S. for the first time since 2010 and marks an important milestone for our customers, as well as the Beckman Coulter team. As Beckman enters its third year with Danaher, we are actively increasing growth investments in business, particularly in R&D, to boost new products vitality and ultimately, drive higher organic growth rates. At Radiometer, core sales were up at a high single-digit rate with growth in all major product lines. High-growth markets were up more than 20% in the quarter, led by China, which grew about 45%. Instrument placements were particularly strong in the quarter with blood gas up 25% and AQT up over 50%. As previously announced, Radiometer closed the acquisition of HemoCue, a leader in hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing. At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led advanced staining, which is up low-teens in the quarter. Most major geographies saw growth with particular strength in China, which grew at a high-teens rate. Further, our core histology business grew low single-digits year-over-year. And we are pleased to report that Leica Biosystems can be found in 100% of the top 50 cancer centers in America as recently ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Subsequent to quarter end, Leica Biosystems acquired Amsterdam-based Kreatech Diagnostics. Along with Leica's advanced staining instruments, Kreatech's probes and reagents enable customers to detect genetic aberrations that may lead to cancer and other diseases. Our Life Sciences platform core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. AB SCIEX core revenues were up mid-single-digits, led by robust growth in pharma and the applied markets, particularly food and environmental. The 6500, our high-end Triple Quad platform, continues to be very well received by customers globally in all major market segments and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue on an annualized basis. AB SCIEX recently launched its 3200MD CE-IVD series of mass spectrometers for clinical diagnostic use in Europe. This is an exciting achievement for AB SCIEX as the 3200MD expands their addressable market to include clinical care customers. And we look forward to leveraging channel synergies with our diagnostics platform to help drive growth of this largely previously focused product category from the research realm. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up mid-single-digits, led by double-digit growth in China, the Middle East and Japan. We continue to see solid demand for our confocal microscopy systems, which grew over 10% in the quarter. Demand for our SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope remains robust, growing at a mid -- growing at a high-teens rate. To expand our go-to market efforts in Latin America, we acquired Aotec, Leica's distribution partner for microscopy and histopathology solutions based in São Paulo, Brazil. Turning to Dental. Segment revenues grew 3% in the second quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating margin increased 90 basis points while reported operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 15.3%. Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single-digits, led by sales of professional dental consumables across most major geographies. In addition, our implant business grew at a high-teens rate as they continue to take market share. Kerr recently launched the Demi Ultra curing light system, the industry's first Ultracapacitor-powered light curing system, which provides dentists with more efficient curing and eliminates the need for battery power. Ormco's Insignia Advanced Smile Design received the 2013 American Technology Award in Health & Medical Technologies from the TechAmerica Foundation. This award is presented annually to the product that most improves the delivery of health services. KaVo's core revenues were up low single-digits, driven by demand in China and other high-growth markets. Last quarter, we highlighted the new i-CAT Flex, which achieves a full 3D scan at lower radiation doses than traditional 2D Panoramic X-ray imagers. Reception in the market has been outstanding with the Flex receiving a best new product award at the Henry Schein National Sales Meeting and the 2013 Pride Institute award for best-in-class technology. In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 2% while core revenues declined 2.5% for the quarter. Both our reported and core operating margin increased 110 basis points with our reported operating margin at 23.5%. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a mid-teens rate with weakness in most major verticals. We've begun seeing signs of stabilization in North American distribution, which grew modestly both year-over-year and sequentially. As evidenced by strong profit performance, Motion continues to transition out of some of their lower-margin business. This transition will continue to impact core revenues, which are expected to remain negative in the second half of this year. Core revenues were up -- in Product Identification platform were up mid-single-digits with solid demand from our in-line variable printing technologies, as well as our packaging and color management solutions. Sales increased across most major geographies. Those of you who joined us last week in Chicago at our Investor Day saw firsthand the evolution of our Product ID platform from our core marking and coding businesses into a leading provider of integrated packaging solutions, spanning the entire consumer packaging value chain. I thought our team did a great job illustrating how we use strategy and DBS to establish and then build and grow a strategic platform. For those of you that weren't able to participate, I strongly encourage you to watch the replay available on our website. At Videojet, new product introductions have been an important driver of our share gains. In the quarter, we introduced the 1620 and 1650 lines of ultra high-speed printers capable of speeds 40% faster than the previous industry benchmark with minimal planned downtime. Also in the quarter, Procter & Gamble announced their adoption of Pantone's new cloud-based color management solution, PantoneLIVE, which improves operational efficiency throughout the packaging supply chain. This is the second major consumer packaged goods company to adopt PantoneLIVE, building on early momentum in the market. So to wrap up, we were very pleased with our second quarter results, better-than-anticipated core revenue growth and outstanding execution led to solid operational performance. We are initiating third quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.83, which assumes 2% to 3% core revenue growth. We are narrowing our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.37 to $3.42 from a previous range of $3.32 to $3.47. As we move into the second half of the year, we're maintaining a conservative macro outlook while staying confident in our ability to deliver solid operating margin expansion. We expect investments in innovation and the high-growth markets to continue to drive growth and share gains. Our earnings outperformance in the second quarter allows us to make additional high-impact growth investments and to fund productivity and efficiency initiatives that we believe will position us well for the balance of this year and beyond.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. Jennifer, that concludes the formal comments. We are now ready for some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Let's talk a little bit about the investments you're making in the -- I mean, Larry, can you help us understand, what -- how much of this is driving growth versus restructuring and cutting costs? And I guess, the question, the obvious question here is that are you investing more money just because you're seeing or thinking there's going to be a reacceleration of growth? Or is it more focused on getting costs out ahead of continued weak -- relatively weak macro environment?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, I would say that operationally, this is really more of the same, consistent with the path we've been on in this slower-growth macro environment that we're operating in today. And frankly, I think we see ourselves working through going forward. So there's no macro call here to suggest we see an inflection point relative to things getting materially better. And hence, we want to be ready for that. I think that as we've seen through the first half of this year, we've been well served, having in the past positioned ourselves not only with the step-up in R&D to drive new product launches, but also our step-up particularly in the high-growth markets to go grab market share where we can. And in turn, to make sure we're being smart about our cost structure, we can make those investments and drive the margin expansion and the earnings growth that you've seen. So what we're really talking about here in terms of taking the beat and putting it back into the business, if you will, in the second half is really a combination of stepping up those growth investments, both in R&D and sales and marketing, as well as in those productivity efforts that you've typically seen us put through in the second half. And we flagged last year on that point or the end of last year that we probably had dialed in about $70 million this year in the back half to do that. We're going to step that up here, certainly as we look to the second half. But again, it's really a balanced approach to make sure we're making the investments for share gains and margin expansion as we work our way through the second half of this year.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And as a follow-up to that, Larry, when you think about the step-up you've had in R&D, I mean, you're already fairly -- you've always been a fairly large investor in R&D, so it's not as if you've underinvested in the past. But the step-up in 2013 versus '12, do you anticipate this being an ongoing trend and then you have another step-up in '14? Or is this reset the bar and you're kind of holding in this level versus sales longer-term? And I have just a quick follow-up to that, just in -- conceptually, every company we cover is raising R&D as a percent of sales, and I think even in the medical world that's happening. Has this become a little bit of a tax, if you will, that it just costs more to drive incremental growth and you don't really get that much net benefit because everybody's investing more? It's a bit of an arms race. Or is it really some differentiation that you think can occur with that added investment?
Daniel L. Comas: Scott, it's Dan. As we look back at Q2, we really saw the benefit across a number of the businesses in the step-up in R&D. So we talked about Hach, Gilbarco, PID, all businesses where we think we took share in the quarter. Their new product revenues improved sequentially 50% Q1 to Q2. And we think that was a big driver of the share gains. So I think we are seeing -- we're not seeing it everywhere, but some of this targeted step-up we've made in R&D, we are seeing the payback for that. And I think as long as we continue to see that and we're taking share, our bias would be to spend more.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. I mean that's [ph] the crux of my question, right. I mean, if you can gain share, it's definitely worth it. If it's just grow in line with the market, but you have to spend more, then it starts to -- industry structure starts come into the question, I guess.
H. Lawrence Culp: And Scott, to the structural question, I would just add, I think Dan's spot-on there, that if you were in the sessions with us as we talked to the businesses, the tone is really fundamentally an offensive one. We see opportunities to do things no one else does. We see opportunities to help a customer in a way that maybe we uniquely can. And that really drives the agenda, the budget in any step-up that you see. There's really not a lot of examples, where we're sitting there, saying, "Gosh, there's catch-up to be made, a tax, as you say, to be paid." So I think that qualitatively, combined with the quantitative market share impact that we're seeing, suggests these are good investments for us. But we'll continue to be prudent to make sure we're getting those returns as we put this additional money in.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on the second quarter, I understand that it's kind of a similar revenue seasonality, if I'm kind of doing the math correct, on the core as last year. Is that right, first of all? Just a sequential decline?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes. So we were down -- I mean, last year, we were down about $140 million Q2 to Q3. We probably have become a little bit more seasonal, a little weaker in Q3 given some of the acquisitions we've done over the last couple of years. I don't think we'll be down $140 million sequentially, but maybe we're down, call it, $100 million.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I mean, when I look at, like Beckman, for example, I think it was pretty -- if you go back historically with their business, it was kind of flat to up seasonally. And then last year, I think I thought you had kind of the initial dropoff in some of the more cyclical businesses, as well as that Life Sciences, call it, I don't know, an air pocket or whatever you want to call it on the product side. So I guess, that's the difference between the $100 million and $140 million is -- I'm just struggling to -- this is probably last year was probably your biggest sequential decline, and I'm just kind of struggling to figure out what's changed here relative to, I don't know, 10 years of history.
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I think part of the history is a number of years where we've done Q2 acquisitions. So the organic decline we've had historically over the last 5 years, Q2 to Q3 is larger than our printed numbers as an acquisition element. So the seasonality was more severe last year but not -- less out of line than the numbers would suggest because of M&A.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Is there any change in the level of restructuring this year as well? Like I think you talked about a couple of pennies of investment in the third quarter but I guess, just the fourth quarter.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. That's what I was trying to suggest in response to Scott's question, Steve. So we're stepping up both the growth investments and the productivity moves.
Operator: We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Larry, interested on the somewhat better North American industrial. I mean, you talked about the distribution piece. Anymore color on that? I mean, was it a restock or pickup in end demand or anything you could make out of it?
H. Lawrence Culp: I mean, I think we flagged that both at Fluke and in Motion. I'm not sure we're ready to extrapolate too much from that at least at this point. I think we were encouraged to see Fluke improve sequentially in that regard. But I think we need to see this play out for another quarter or so to think we've got legs there. There was some inventory movement at Motion, which is part of what we saw there. But again, I think it's early signs, but we'll see how the third quarter plays out.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And how about on the tax side of things, I mean, any movement in either direction in terms of customers' sort of attitudes around equipment spending on that side?
H. Lawrence Culp: No. I think, clearly, sequentially things improved, but we are still negative from a core perspective. I think we've got the potential to be positive in the second half in large part because of the comps. But as you know, I mean, one geography in particular that we're watching closely, particularly in T&M, on the instrument side is China. China has been a real struggle, particularly as the export base has struggled there. The comps help us probably more than necessarily the underlying demand does. But I think that combination should help us get positive there in the second half but not wildly or overly so.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So you haven't seen any sort of significant change in behavior yet?
H. Lawrence Culp: Not yet. We're looking. Believe me, we're looking.
Operator: We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So just a quick follow-on to some previous questions. So Dan, I think you've referred to the step-up in R&D. Obviously, it makes sense if you're getting the payback. But the 40 bps in the quarter, is that indicative of the kind of step-up you expect in the back half of the year?
Daniel L. Comas: In that range, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then Larry, the restructuring expense, you mentioned a couple of cents in 2Q -- in 3Q. But the 4Q, I mean, so how do we think about that? Do you have a number in mind? Or is that number fungible depending on how the back half plays out?
Daniel L. Comas: Nigel, I think we're still a little fluid in that regard. As Larry highlighted, we talked about $70 million in our plan in the second half. That will be more fourth quarter than the third quarter, that's pretty typical. But we're going to spend more than that $70 million here. And we're still sort of figuring that out. We're trying to embed that in our guidance.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: But more than $30 million in the fourth quarter rather than the second half?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes. Well, it tends to be more Q4-focused, yes. There'll be some in Q3, but it will be more biased to Q4.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then switching to the performance at Beckman. Obviously, very encouraging to see mid-single-digit growth so early. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that? Is it pull-up [ph] in attrition? Are we seeing more gross adds? Any help there would be interesting.
H. Lawrence Culp: Nigel, it's really not any one thing. But I think the program that we've been working to improve our retention and win rates in North America, I think, our step-up in terms of the investments in the high-growth markets, which really have been driving most of the growth at Beckman. And certainly, as we fix the quality issues, witness troponin and others, but also bring on some additional new products, every little bit helps, right? So to see a mid-single-digit quarter here isn't necessarily in any way a declaration of victory. But having been out there here in the last couple of weeks, I just think we've got a lot of progress and momentum building in the commercial execution and new product development, which bodes well for the business. But again, as you've heard me say, there's still a lot of work to do, but we're highly confident we're going to continue to improve Beckman and make that as good as any Danaher business that we have.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And how do you see [ph] the upside of Beckman for the second half of the year? Have you assumed that great quarter but let's not assume it continues? Or have you rolled forward some of that upside in the second half of the year?
Daniel L. Comas: Nigel, I think we're still working with a low single-digit focus in the second half here but clearly, a little bit more encouraged given what we've seen not only the numbers we printed, but just the general tone of the business.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just first question. The T&M core margin decline of 30 basis points, was all of that due to operating leverage? Or what other -- any other dynamics in that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, it's really a combination of 2 things. One, as we noted, instruments is down, instruments is the higher-margin piece of that segment so that hurts. And communications is an area, where we are stepping up our growth investments. Clearly, not the best growth quarter they've ever registered. But as you know, probably one of our best growth businesses here in the last couple of years with a tremendous amount of runway, given their focus in mobility, their opportunities in security, and certainly, building up more of a position with the enterprise customer base. So it's really the instruments volume and the R&D step-up, really the OpEx step-up and comms which create that pinch.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then talked about Beckman a bunch. But if you step back now 2 years later, how are the financials compared to your original expectations both for ROIC and accretion at this point now?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, we're right on track, probably the revenue is a little better. Margins are ahead of where we thought they would be. We thought we'd have $250 million of costs by the end of this year. We're north of $300 million. So a little ahead of the margins and a little bit ahead on the revenue line as well.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And maybe just a little bit of overarching commentary on any changes in the M&A environment is always helpful on these calls.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I don't think we've really seen a change, Steve, in the last 90 days. I think we're encouraged and fundamentally optimistic about our ability to deploy the capacity that we have, the $8 billion or so that you heard us talk about in terms of the next couple of years. And clearly, valuations are up. That means we can't buy every company we might want to buy, but that's never our MO, right? We're looking for great fits where we can add value, where we can generate a return for our shareholders. And the silver lining in an environment like this, particularly for a strategic, well-capitalized buyer like ourselves, is you can have high-quality conversations with high-quality companies. We're doing just that. So we continue to, I think, have that level of optimism of confidence that we will smartly deploy that capital to help build out the businesses as we move forward here. But again, not a dramatic sea change 90 days on.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Partners.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I'm wondering if we could just try to put a little finer point on some of this incremental spending. Dan, I guess, you made it pretty clear the $70 million is in flux, you don't know where it goes. But I guess, first point, would we be talking about it if it's only $5 million or $10 million?
Daniel L. Comas: No, we would not be. So if it was $10 million, $15 million more, we wouldn't be talking about it. So maybe it's in that $90 million, $100 million range.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just trying to get a head around the incremental R&D and SG&A growth spending, you gave the basis points in R&D to Nigel. But relative to what you were thinking, how much is that changing? We heard the story of 170 new marketing people just at Videojet alone last week. It seems like there is a lot going on. But was that all kind of baked in the plan? Or is there a real increase there, too?
H. Lawrence Culp: In terms of what we're talking about for the second half, there are real increases both in R&D and some on the sales and marketing side. We've mentioned the high-growth markets. You flagged some of the marketing initiatives there as well, Jeff, fortunately saw in Wood Dale. It's really a step-up. Because as we go through the year, we obviously are reading and reacting. We're learning, we're developing skills. And we don't want to be too static in those growth investments. So we really -- when you hear us talk about dynamic resource allocation, we're really trying in real time to fund the opportunities as quickly as we can as opposed to being slaved to an annual budget.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. So even there, we're not talking about single-digit millions then, we're probably talking about 5s and 10s sort of thing?
Daniel L. Comas: That's probably correct.
H. Lawrence Culp: That's fair.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Yes. And then just back to kind of Q3, I guess, the whole sequential discussion. But on a year-over-year basis, the comp is really easy against obviously what was a pretty disappointing Q3 last year. Why wouldn't you accelerate a little bit against that, just a 0.8% organic last year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Right. Well, there's no question, Jeff, there's an easier comp in the third. I think what we're trying to share with you today is in essence what we're seeing customers and markets saying and doing today, right? So as we work through what's happening at point of sales, we talk to our distribution partners. As we go through our sales pipelines with our direct business, as we take a pulse of both the headwinds and the tailwinds out there externally, I think we come up with a top line figure that suggests that on a core basis, we're likely to be in that 2% to 3% range here in the third quarter. It's really as simple and as straightforward as that.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Great. And then just finally, can you size in basis points or dollars, whatever is easier, just how significant the Motion headwind is just from kind of unwinding the lower-margin project -- products?
H. Lawrence Culp: There's probably, call it, 400 or 500 basis points of core revenue headwind within Motion as a result of that, I think, appropriate and smart transitioning out of some of that lower-margin business. So we take the core revenue hit, but you clearly see the resilience of those Motion revenues as the positive offset, a trade we'll take any day.
Daniel L. Comas: The Motion margin.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, excuse me.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So you've talked a bunch about Beckman, Larry. On Leica, I just remembered, last quarter in Leica Bio, you had the control issue, Europe distribution change, worried of potentially new competitor coming to market. Can you just give a little bit of an update on each of those issues and kind of where you stand on Leica Bio in the quarter and for the rest of the year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. I think in terms of the control issue for the broader audience, we have seen in the U.S. some policy guidance changes, which has negatively impacted some of our underlying volume in the business. I think that is modest and kind of working its way through the business. Our European distribution change there continues. But I think we certainly had a better quarter in that regard than we did in the first and continue to believe strategically that we're heading in the right direction and financially we should see less headwind as a result. And you mentioned competition. I have no idea who you're thinking of there, Jon, but we haven't really seen any material competitive pressure change here of late and continue to believe that, particularly in advanced staining, we saw very strong underlying growth vis-à-vis the market.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So would you expect kind of what you saw in the second quarter here to continue in the second half for Leica Bio?
H. Lawrence Culp: We would -- we certainly have that expectation with LBS as we drive into the second half.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just one more. I did the math on the core diagnostics of Beckman. It looks like you said in your Q, I think you said North America and Europe were actually down low single. So it's looking like high growth and probably China is still kind of plus 20%. Anything at all you're seeing there, given what's going on in China that makes you concerned that, that could slow some? Just maybe an update geographically on that business.
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, Jon. I think it's hard not to be a little bit cautious on that front, just the number of quarters we put back-to-back-to-back was 20%. And China is not [ph] part of the high-growth market. So we think they'll continue to be very good. Could there be some tempering? I think that's a possibility. And while Europe and the U.S. were down, they were down less than they were the last couple of quarters. So hopefully, we can get a little bit of improvement in the developed markets because I think there's some likelihood we'll have very good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's going to be probably hard to sustain at these levels.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So do you think North America and Europe could be getting to a point where they actually turn positive in the next few quarters here, given some of the successes that you've talked about at Beckman?
Daniel L. Comas: We are not yet prepared to forecast, but we like the trend line.
Operator: We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just on the operating cash flow, it was down 2% in Q1, it was down 14% in Q2. And you talked in the Q about the timing of customer deposits in T&M and so on in the network comm side. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how quickly you expect the operating cash flow to normalize? And what's driven that customer deposits issue?
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. Julian, there are probably 3 factors driving the first half cash flow being down slightly year-on-year. I'll come back to the customer deposits in the third point. One of which is just the timing of tax payments. We've had relatively higher tax payments here in the first half. That will normalize through the year. The second element is we have slightly higher inventory levels. Part of that is related to a number of new product launches. We talked about some of the benefits we're seeing at Hach, Gilbarco, Product ID. Again, we expect the inventory levels to normalize through the year. And then finally, customer deposits. Last year on some large projects, we were able to get some upfront payments. That will probably not normalize through the year so that will be a slight headwind, but these others 2 factors will help. And you should see an acceleration back to more normalized level of cash flow through the balance of the year.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then within Environmental, you talked a bit about municipal spending being down. Not a surprise, but I guess, any sense on the pace of the declines or how that's -- how you think that will trend as we go through the year?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, it was a little bit bifurcated. So the lower-ticket municipal spending actually got sequentially better Q1 to Q2. We're probably a little cautious of that because the governments have year ends of June 30. So we may have seen a little bit of benefit. But it's okay. It's not great, but again probably a little better than what we saw in Q1, continue to see the high ticket stuff to be challenging. And I don't think we're calling for a turn in that part of the business.
H. Lawrence Culp: And that comp is really focused, I think, in the U.S. and to a degree, in Europe. We're pleased with the China growth that we saw for now 2 quarters here coming in no small part from the muni side, which had been a bit more sluggish for us over the last couple of years.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just lastly on Europe, there has been some hope around slightly higher PMIs and so on. It doesn't sound like you have seen anything at all around any kind of inflection point in any end market in Europe. Is that fair or...
Daniel L. Comas: Julian, we were down a point or 2 in Europe, which has been comparable to maybe slightly better than what we've been seeing. We've seen a few of our businesses -- PID had a better quarter in Europe. But I'd say generally speaking, we're not seeing much of any turn here.
Operator: We'll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Larry, Dan, could you give us a view around the book-to-bill in T&M in the quarter? And how would you expect that business to trend in the second half, particularly for Tek instruments? And to what degree are you beginning to see any change in demand trends out of China?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I mean, T&M book-to-bill was flat. I think as we look at Tek for the second half and really instruments more broadly, I think we have the opportunity to grow, call it, low singles, if all goes well. China is really important. China is important both at Tek and at Fluke. And as I mentioned earlier, we've seen softness, prolonged softness both with the export base, which we largely serve at Tek, and frankly in a host of other verticals that deal with domestic infrastructure, principally at Fluke. But as we have gone through those reviews recently with the teams, again in part due to the comps, in part because some of our own execution opportunities, we think we can go positive here in the second half and we're going to be working hard to do that. But China will be an important swing factor for that instruments platform, no doubt.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then Dan, in terms of the overall core revenue growth experienced in the quarter, can you give us a breakdown between equipment and consumables?
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. The consumables stayed right in that -- consumables and aftermarkets stayed right in that 3% to 4% range, all up. And equipment and instruments were a little better than Q1, so we were essentially flat in Q1 and we were up 1% to 2%. Again, we talked about some of that Gilbarco, some of the Life Sciences businesses benefiting to that number.
Operator: We'll go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So just on Industrial Tech, wanted to put your comments on Motion in context to that core growth target, 0% to 3%, you put out last December. You guys trended a little bit lower than that in the first half. So I just want to make sure I understand what's embedded in your assumptions for the back half of the year.
Daniel L. Comas: In the back half, we're looking at Industrial Tech to be flat to slightly down in the third quarter. The biggest driver of that would be Motion, which we expect to be down high single-digits. Most of that [indiscernible] getting out of some of this very low-margin business. And then the fourth quarter, we'd expect a sequential improvement from that.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then just in China maybe qualitatively, we touched on that issue a couple of different ways here. But I do want to spend a minute with regards to the nature of your customers in China, specifically with regards to capacity utilization. I mean, I think we all know a lot of the growth in China has been driven by success in investment. And I think one thing that's harder for us to read is sort of what your customers' capacity utilization looks like on your products over there just qualitatively. Can you maybe comment on that and just how think about what your customers' underlying demand looks like just given the current environment there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Isaac, I admittedly can't give you a figure as to our diagnostics customers, our Chinese diagnostics customers' utilization of our installed base over there. But I would say, as you might anticipate, it's higher, closer to the coast. Those new installs that have gone in are ramping. But there's probably very few places outside of the major coastal cities where our installed base is anywhere close to capacity. So we're proud to be part of this health care initiative in China. And certainly, as that installed base is utilized more actively in the delivery of enhanced care, that will be good for those patients and it will be good business for us.
Operator: We'll go next to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Troponin, is that going to be significant to growth in the segment? Or is it -- like when does that kick in, do you guys think?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I -- those are 2 different questions, John. I think it's kicking in now that we have that 510(k) approval. And frankly, it's kicking in not only in terms of the resumption of being able to sell that product, but it's another box that's checked in terms of the commitments we made to not only our regulators, but our customers, which helps the overall business. I think we've tried to downplay the specific quantitative financial impact, John, of getting those assays back on the market just because largely I think that was overdone. I think this was more a reputational issue. And as we've gone through this hoop and others, I think people understand that we're getting Beckman back in the shape that it once was in and will be again. And that helps us with retention, that helps us with new customer wins, not only here in the U.S., where this issue was most acute, but more broadly as well.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. No, Larry, I'm just wondering, is there a sort of a short-term pop-up, if you will, that maybe is significant to Beckman's results that you could see sort of near-term associated with troponin?
H. Lawrence Culp: I would say if there's any near-term pop, it would be muted and immaterial.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So that makes sense. Can I ask you about just maybe, Dan, is where these pricing trends perhaps juxtaposed with some declining raws, how are you guys sort of seeing that across your portfolio or, say, across significant differences in geographies if anything is noteworthy?
Daniel L. Comas: John, I just probably have a top level point of view. Our prices remained about 70 basis points the last 2, 3 quarters. Again, getting it on the consumables and the aftermarket, relatively flat on the equipment, on the instruments. So part of that 100 basis points of margin improvement is the cost actions we took last year. But clearly, we're seeing some price-cost benefit right now. Not getting a lot of price, getting a little bit of price and seeing some benefit on the cost side.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Are there any discernible differences, Dan, in terms of pricing trend sequentially that would be...
Daniel L. Comas: No. I mean, we did say this started a couple of quarters ago that it got tougher to get price on equipment and instruments. And we went from maybe slightly positive to kind of flattish, slightly negative price but probably overall flattish instruments and equipments. And that has stayed relatively steady here at least through the second quarter.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And just lastly, Larry, as you think about emerging markets, and you guys obviously are doing extremely well in China, part of the playbook, I think, had been to sort of broaden that success into the Indias and Latin Americas of the world. But clearly, the world looks perhaps different today as it did even a year ago in terms of the run rate for those markets. How are you, Danaher, strategically thinking about that? And why not maybe go for even more penetration in China if some of these markets around the world, maybe with the exception of the Middle East, look like they could be significantly more challenged in the coming few years in terms of realizing growth rates?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think strategically, John, as you rightly point out, and you know this as well as anyone, what we try to do is build on our China-first strategy the last couple of years and taking the successes we've had and learnings we've taken to all the other high-growth regions of the world. I think the evidence that we're having good traction in that regard for all the examples peppered through our prepared remarks in terms of the successes we're having in the Middle East, what we're seeing in Brazil, Eastern Europe, right on down the line. India has been a little softer for us this year, to be sure. Latin America, in part because of a couple of tough comps, was tough in the second quarter. But that basket, which is no longer a China-only basket, was up, what, high singles here. I think we're mindful of the headlines relative to that basket as we think about the second half. I think that's part of our conservative posture on the macro. But strategically, you hit the point. These markets may slow in their overall growth, but they're still going to be the best game in town and the penetration levels of most of our products in these parts of the world are still pretty modest. So you pick your market, take 200, take 500 basis points of growth off the top, yes, that will define how much investment monies we have to put into play. But that underlying growth, our penetration opportunities to grow in excess of those market rates still makes those spaces, those places incredibly important targets for us. And that's the way we're operating.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: We covered a lot of ground here already, and maybe just some closing comments regarding guidance. And Larry, last quarter, you had some specific commentary about having more of a midpoint bias to earnings guidance. Now you put up a solid second quarter. You're playing a little bit more offense and making some growth investments. So how would you characterize that bias today? And then same question for core revenue growth for the second half.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think that what we've done here, Deane, with the update on guidance is really stay true to that midpoint mindset that you heard me express back on the first quarter call. So being at the halfway point here, have a little bit more clarity as to the puts and takes, it doesn't really change our outlook materially in that regard and we thought we can tighten up the guidance accordingly. I really think it's that simple. In terms of the core outlook, I think we're looking at a low single-digit environment here in the second half. We've quantified that as 2% to 3% as best we can figure here for the third quarter. But in essence, I think what we saw in the second quarter is on balance likely what we're dealing with here in the second half. We wish it were otherwise, but it is what it is and we're going to outperform accordingly.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Matt McGrew for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Well, thanks for joining us, everybody. We'll be around all day for follow-ups.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment to let our associates, our friends and the people of Boston know that they are in our thoughts in the wake of this week's most tragic and unfortunate news. We entered the quarter with modest expectations regarding global growth, and that played out largely as we anticipated with our core revenue growth coming in at 1%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets, which represent 24% of our business, grew to high single-digit rate in the quarter. China was up low double-digits, led again by our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses, which grew in excess of 20%. Also encouraging was the double-digit growth we saw in our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses in China. In contrast, sales in the U.S. were flat, which was slightly below our outlook, while Western Europe, as expected, was down low single-digits. Despite this low-growth environment, the Danaher Business System continues to help us drive share gains, margin and cash flow. In the quarter, DBS growth tools helped accelerate new product introductions across many of our businesses, and coupled with our go-to-market initiatives, we believe drove share gains at Kerr, Videojet, ChemTreat, Tektronix Communications, Esko and Radiometer. We were encouraged by our strong gross margin performance, up 50 basis points or $90 million year-over-year to 52.3%, which allowed us to sustain our core growth investments in both new product development and sales and marketing. We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. We announced the signing of over $300 million of new acquisitions during the quarter. With our strong free cash flow, ample balance sheet capacity and the proceeds from the recent sale of the Apex Tools JV, we now expect to have about $8 billion available for capital deployment over the next 2 years. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.75, up 2.5% relative to the comparable amount in the first quarter of last year and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Excluding the impact on prior year earnings of the Apex JV, net earnings per share increased 6%. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $4.4 billion with core revenues up 1%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3%, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 1%. Our gross margin for the first quarter increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 52.3%. Our reported operating margin in the first quarter was 16.4% with core margins up 20 basis points. First quarter operating cash flow was $637 million, with free cash flow from continuing operations of $520 million. We expect full year free cash flow to exceed $3 billion. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio, excluding the gain on the sale of the Apex JV and the impact from $40 million of cash payments related to our fourth quarter restructuring, was greater than 100%. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1% for the quarter while core revenues were flat. While core margins were down 25 basis points year-on-year, segment margin saw a significant sequential improvement over the prior 2 quarters. Fluke core revenues grew at low single-digit rate, their first quarter of positive core growth since the fourth quarter 2011. Mid-single-digit growth in North American industrial end markets and high single-digit growth in high-growth markets was partially offset by softness in Europe and in other North American markets. Last quarter, we highlighted Fluke's launch of the VT02 visual thermometer, which may you have heard about as it was featured in March in a broad nationwide range of radio campaign. Using DBS growth tools, Fluke identified a white space opportunity in an adjacent product category and developed this innovative entry price point temperature measurement tool with an integrated visual heat map to meet customer needs. We've been encouraged by the sales ramp of the VT02 in both the U.S. and Europe. At Tektronix, core revenues declined at a low double-digit rate with continued weakness across many end markets. Despite difficult market conditions, we continue to innovate and increase the breadth of our product portfolio at Tektronix. During the quarter, we launched a multiphase PA4000 Power Analyzer, which will be used by engineers on the management for the development of high-efficiency electrical products, such as motors for hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles and household appliances. This innovative new product is Tektronix's initial entry into this adjacent high-growth segment. Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, driven by demand for both our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Tektronix Communications' low-teens growth was driven by demand for its mobile carrier network management solutions in North America and China. Arbor Networks network security solutions remain in very high demand as DdoS attack have increased in both frequency and size. Both sales and orders increased greater than 25% in the quarter as we won several new service provider accounts in high-growth markets and saw strong growth in our U.S. enterprise business. Environmental segment revenues increased 4.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margins expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin flat at 18.6%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. Hach Lange core revenues grew low single-digits with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East, offsetting flat demand in the developed markets. Healthy North American industrial activity, particularly in beverage and power, was partially offset by weaker U.S. municipal demand. ChemTreat marked their 11th straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Latin American core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter as expansion efforts into the Mexican market continued to gain traction, including several large wins in the quarter with industrial accounts. Over the last 4 years, the Mexican business has grown over 300% driven by the best-in-class, go-to market initiatives. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's first quarter core revenues were essentially flat in both the developed and high-growth markets with strong growth in Russia and India, offset by difficult comparison from prior year regulatory changes. We saw solid growth in our payment business in the quarter, with shipments on several large-scale rollouts throughout Asia. New payment technologies and innovations at retail service stations and convenience stores is an attractive growth driver for GVR. Highlighting this during the quarter, GVR announced a partnership with PayPal to develop digital payment and other mobile solutions for customers worldwide. Using GVR's Passport POS, customers will be able to pay using their PayPal account with their mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry cash or credit cards. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Segment core operating margins increased slightly, while our reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points from the prior year period to 12.7%. Our Diagnostics businesses saw a good start to the year with mid-single-digit core growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales increased at a low single-digit rate despite the impact of 1 less day in the quarter with growth in all major product categories. This marks the fourth straight quarter of low single-digit or better core growth at Beckman, with high-growth markets continuing to drive this performance. Beckman's best-in-class automation capabilities, an increase in the cadence of new product development and the significant quality and service improvements we've seen over the last 18 months position them well for continued growth. We anticipate low single-digit growth for the rest of this year and expect to be on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2014. During the quarter, we launched 2 new products, the DxH 600 hematology system and the Power Express total lab automation system. The DxH 600 extends the hematology portfolio to better address the needs of larger-volume clinical labs. Power Express continues to enhance Beckman's leadership in clinical automation by enabling labs to connect multiple analyzers easily to improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce cost. Radiometer's core sales increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter with growth in most major geographies and particular strength in China and the Middle East, which were both up over 30% in the quarter. Our AQT line was up 40% in the quarter, and we hit a milestone with our 1,000th instrument placement since launch. Last week, we closed a previously announced acquisition of HemoCue, a leader on hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing. Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, led by double-digit core histology growth. Advanced staining revenues decreased mid-single-digits as solid demand in North America and China was more than offset by a decline in Western Europe, where we are transitioning from a distribution to a direct-sales model in parts of that region. Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues increased low single-digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew mid-single-digits, led by the applied and pharma markets. We've been pleased with a very strong uptake of our new 6500 Triple Quad and QTRAP systems since their launch late last year. During the quarter, AB SCIEX announced a multiyear collaboration agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle for the development of new methods in technologies and proteomics research using mass spectrometry. This research, led by 2012 National Medal of Science award winner Dr. Leroy Hood, will help develop a new approach to medical care by redefining biomarker research and complementary genomics through qualitative swap proteomics analysis using the AB SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF. We are pleased to support both the ISB and Dr. Hood in this groundbreaking research. Leica Microsystems core sales declined low single-digits with strong sales in Life Sciences, offset by weakness in industrial and medical markets. The recently launched SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope continues to be well received globally and was a strong contributor to growth in the Life Science market during the quarter. Turning now to Dental. Our segment revenues grew 3% in the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating margin increased 20 basis points, while reported operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Dental consumables core revenues grew low single digits in the quarter, led by our sales for general dentistry consumables and infection prevention products across most major geographies. In addition, our implant business was up mid-teens. During the quarter, Ormco launched the Lythos Digital Impression System. Lythos allows an orthodontist to have a complete digital orthodontic workflow, beginning with the scanning of the patient's mouth through the creation of a 3D treatment plan to the custom design and manufacture of the orthodontic appliance. KaVo core revenues increased mid-single-digits with robust demand for instruments and imaging products. KaVo launched 6 new products in the quarter at 2 of the largest trade shows in the industry, the Chicago Midwinter Dental Meeting and the International Dental Show in Germany. New products included the i-CAT Flex [ph], which allows for a full 3D scan at a lower radiation dose than a panoramic X-ray. In addition, Instrumentarium launched a CR reader, an easy-use, cost-effective phosphor plate imaging reader. We also introduced an innovative Twisted File Adaptive endodontic product, which self-adjusts between a rotary and reciprocating motion, providing the clinician with exceptional control during root canals. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues increased 7% for the quarter while core revenues declined 1.5%. Our core operating margins expanded 105 basis points in the first quarter, while our reported operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.9%. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter with the same weakness in most major geographies. Our sales into U.S. distribution were particularly soft. Product Identification core revenues were up mid-single-digits with growth across all major geographies. Videojet enjoyed high single-digit growth in service and mid-single-digit growth in both equipment and consumables in the first quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping both the both the 1550 and the 1650 next-generation CIJ printers, which are targeted primarily at customers in the food and beverage markets, where predictability of uptime and avoidance of errors is critical. Initial customer feedback has been extremely positive on these new products, and we expect the placements will continue to increase through the balance of the year. At Esko, core revenue increased more than 10% in the quarter, led by exceptional performance in high-growth markets, including Latin America and China. DBS continues to have a significant impact in driving growth at Esko. Using dynamic resource allocation to fund internally go-to-market investments in high-growth markets, Esko has more than doubled the feet-on-the-street in Latin America and China since our acquisition in 2011. Over the same period, sales in those geographies have grown in excess of 35%. Revenues at X-Rite grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter compared to a year ago when it was a standalone company. X-Rite becomes part of our reported core number later this quarter. While still early, we're excited about X-Rite's contribution to the PID platform and the new collaboration and go-to-market opportunities that they bring. An example of this collaboration is the PantoneLIVE, where we recently launched 2 Illustrator plug-ins that were codeveloped with Esko. These plug-ins provide brand owners with instant access to essential brand color standards, as well as the PantoneLIVE Color Libraries directly from within their development software. Reception of PantoneLIVE in the marketplace has exceeded our expectations, with orders tripling sequentially from the fourth quarter. So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. DBS has helped drive share gains, margins and cash flow in this low-growth environment. We believe our solid recurring revenue base, the structural cost actions executed in 2012 and the significant amount of capital available to deploy position us well for the balance of this year and beyond. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.80 to $0.85, which assumes 1% to 2% core growth. We are also reaffirming our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.32 to $3.47.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Lisa, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just starting off with the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margin. It was about 100 bps lighter than, I guess, we were expecting. Can you just talk about, a, kind of what the margin looks like at Beckman, and then if there was anything else that drove that weakness?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think with respect to the -- what you're seeing there, Steve, is we knew, given some of the investments in the segment that we were making, particularly on the sales and marketing and R&D side that margins were going to be tight in LS&D. That said -- and I say that both with respect to the Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses as well as at Dental. We had a couple of big trade shows in Dental, for example, that we had to work through. But that said, clearly the revenue picture in LS&D, particularly in LS, was softer in the end than we anticipated. And that certainly put some of the pressure on the margins that you see. But also in addition to the revenue, I think it's important to point out that we had a couple of not necessarily one-time but I think special situations in the quarter on the expense side that we think mitigate as we go forward. One was this conversion at Leica Bio with respect to the distribution to direct sales model. We had an opportunity to move forward in that regard. I think that made sense strategically. That didn't help us from a cost perspective and practically from a volume perspective as we worked through that late in the quarter. In addition, as the regulatory front evolved over the quarter with a number of the Diagnostics businesses, we had an opportunity to accelerate some of our spending ahead of submissions. And we thought again positioning ourselves to get those new products approved made sense, so we went ahead and did that.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So can you -- I mean, I guess R&D for the company was up 40 basis points year-over-year. I mean, 6.7% is a really big number. Can you let us know, I know you disclose it in your Ks, but maybe in LS&D, what was -- I would assume it was up a little bit more in than the 40 basis points.
Daniel L. Comas: It was. And it also -- given some of this distribution transition we're going through, some of the sales and marketing was also higher. We think that all sort of begin to even out here in Q2, so you'll see, I think, more normalized margins in LSD in Q2.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And can you give any kind of magnitude, Dan, around what the R&D was up as a percentage of sales in LSD?
Daniel L. Comas: We were up combined over 100 basis points between R&D and sales and marketing as a percent of revenues year-on-year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That makes -- and then when you talk about these regulatory filings, I mean, is this just greater-than-expected spending than you would have initially thought as you fix the business? Or is this like -- are these like -- is this more proactive with new products?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Steve, it's probably somewhere in between. I mean, it really is about what we do and when we do it. So some of it is strictly timing. And at the same time, as we work through the plans for those submissions with the regulatory bodies sometimes, we'll -- as time marches on, you get a better sense of the scope and the work required. So we thought accelerating some of that spend wasn't frankly an opportunity, despite the pressure that you allude to here. And again, I think the stronger those submissions are, the sooner they're in, the better off we are relative to getting those products out and launched in time.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just one last question. It's probably a pretty stupid question, but I'll ask it anyway. I guess, with the day sales, with a comp on the -- a tougher comp on the weather, a lot of noise going on out there and some pretty terrible reports coming out so far. On a scale of 1 to 10, if 1 is 2009 and kind of 10 is the ideal operating environment, what do you think -- how do you describe kind of the current environment you're operating in? It's just kind of hard to tell how bad the trend is here. I'm just curious as to your high-level take on that.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Steve, I would say that we came into the quarter knowing that we were going to be missing a day. I think we came into the quarter knowing that Good Friday would be the last day of the quarter. So all of that was knowable. What we saw through the quarter was frankly that our consumables business, which, as you know, represents about 40% of our overall sales, was very much in line with our expectations. And if you adjust for the day that we missed and put aside all the end of March noise, I think we were good. I think where we fell a little bit short here with respect to the quarter was really in equipment, right? I mean, at 60% we thought we'd be up a couple of hundred basis points, and that's where we got squeezed, particularly in the U.S. as we saw some business soften in March when we thought we would finish more strongly. I wouldn't say it's bad. I think we saw the normal uptick in March, just wasn't pronounced in equipment again, in the U.S. principally, around some of the higher-ticket products. We've mentioned TEK. I think we've mentioned Motion as well in the distribution. So in the grand scheme of things, I don't think we're -- we're not necessarily excited about the macro numbers that came out here the last 3 or 4 weeks. But that said, we missed the top end of the core range by about, what, $30 million. If we'd hit that, I don't think we would be talking about some of the OP and EPS shortfalls here. But that's the way it played out. I think at this point, our sense is that while it's early and we don't have everything that we'll have in time, the shortfalls, again, largely a macro dynamic. March didn't finish as strongly as we would have anticipated. But on a relative basis, business-by-businesses, we think we're doing pretty well. I think as we look at April, things would come back in a couple of pockets in the wake of some of that end of March softness. But again, probably too early to read too much into that. Certainly, too early to read much into first couple of weeks of April relative to the equipment side of the business because while things get pushed to the right at times, it may just be a couple of weeks. Sometimes those customer decisions may take longer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of things. I mean, first, the big pullback you saw in Motion was a little bit of a surprise when you have that big of a negative. I mean, were the timing issues there that customers just wanted to destock? I mean, I think you mentioned some weakness in distribution, U.S. technology. Is that something that's going to restart here in 2Q? Or do we have some greater underlying weakness here that's more sustainable?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that's -- it's a bit of a mixed bag, Scott, as we read it today. I mean, you mentioned distribution and TEK. I mean, I think those are 2 different markets for us clearly where we go to market through distribution. We saw soft sell-out as well as our own sell-in. Certainly, the TEK OEMs that we deal with tend to be customers we deal with directly. And we certainly saw pockets in TEK that were soft. I think our view is that as we look at the second quarter, if you wanted to pick a segment that's likely to be down, it will be Industrial Technologies. It will be down largely on the back of Motion softness. Certainly, not softness in Product Identification, which we think will continue to be one of our better-performing businesses here in the near term.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I want to move to 2 other quick things. I mean, the medical businesses have been strong a couple of quarters in a row here in China. Are you seeing that broadening out at all to the other businesses, like Fluke, for example, and the more shorter-cycle businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. We certainly saw, I think, a broadening of the strength in China. Again, the first quarter is a little hard to read sequentially, given the timing of the new year there. But that said, I think we were pleased with the overall print in China, both at depth and its breadth. And as we have worked through our reviews of late with our teams there, I think by and large, there are a few exceptions where guys aren't feeling good about the year, it's really more a matter of this point of calibrating what sort of growth to expect there. But they'll definitely, I think, be one of our better high-growth markets here and the rest of the way.
Daniel L. Comas: I'd say, Scott, on the industrial side, it was instead of all being down or flat, it was mixed. So I guess that's a little bit encouraging. PID and water had good real good start to the year in China. But I'd contrast that and talk [ph] a little bit of a positive sign, but I would say that T&M and Motion didn't -- their numbers were down and sequentially did not feel any better. So uneven but a couple of pockets a little better.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. And then just last question on price. When we have this type of a slow macro environment and it's been largely, probably 7 of the last 10 years has been pretty good pricing environment, now we're seeing some weakness in commodities. I mean, what's the outlook for price from here?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think the price outlook in and around a point of price as we move forward ought to be something that we should achieve. I think on a price cost equation, Scott, in general, pretty pleased. And clearly, having the gross margin up 50 basis points here, $90 million in dollar terms year-on-year, I would suggest we're executing pretty well, not only on the price cost side but also in terms of productivity, our Danaher wide procurement activities, as well as frankly bringing new products to market with higher gross margins, which give us the benefit of the mix up. So if there's one thing I think we're particularly comfortable with, it's that effect. And clearly, we'll get, I think, additional impact from the 2012 restructuring in the gross margin mix as we move through the year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just you mentioned $8 billion of capital available for deployment over the next 2 years. I think that's up from $5-plus billion that you used to discuss. Can you maybe talk about, given the current environment, how your -- where you're thinking about deploying the additional capital? And you obviously mentioned a one positive comment in the release. But give us maybe more of a flavor for how this might transpire.
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, the $8 billion figure, in contrast to the prior frame, is really a function, I think, of being on the other side of Apex. Certainly, a look here at our cash position, which is strong, and our view of our cash flow now being $3-plus billion on an annual basis. And it's really -- it's just that simple. I think strategically as we think about capital deployment, our strategy is in no way changed. I think our view certainly continues to have a bias toward inorganic growth to supplement what we do organically. And we'd like to do that across the entire Danaher portfolio. So as you look today at the way Dan and I and the teams are working together, we're working, I think, funnels that are active across all of our growth platforms. Clearly, we're keen to put that capital work in that fashion.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And the acquisition that you just did, the $300 million one you announced in, I guess, February was in Life Sciences. I mean, how is the industrial pipeline looking or the non-Life Sciences pipeline looking?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I would say we're, one, encouraged by the number of discussions we're having. And I would say it's noticeably better than it was in the second half of '12, probably a little bit of a challenge maybe up to the last couple of weeks. Given equity markets, I do think some of this more choppy economic data of late, maybe including our own on the margins, could be helpful here in getting maybe some things across the finish line.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then on the top line or the implications for the second half, I think EPS implied, given your guide, is somewhere north of 10%, 11%. And top line, given your 1% to 2% in the second quarter, and this quarter at 1%, implies a very significant acceleration in the second half. How much are you thinking -- and that's obviously despite deceleration on many, many fronts across the portfolio. How are you thinking about that being, as opposed to just comp-based versus meaningful material underlying acceleration, all of these major growth investments that you've been making for some time now? Give us maybe some flavor for how you're thinking and talking about it and what's giving you that perspective.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I don't think, Steve, that as we look into the second quarter, let alone the second half, that we're here pounding the table that things are going to get better in a hurry. I think what we're trying to do here with the second quarter outlook is give you a sense of our view out the window as to our operating environment and the way that we're going to perform. If you look at the first quarter, clearly we came in in the midpoint of the range on the bottom, a little short of the range on the top. I think that midpoint mindset, if you will, probably is what's most relevant as you think about the second quarter, let alone the full year. I think to come in at the high end of this range would require the U.S. to get a little bit better than at least some of the most recent data points would suggest. And probably, the strength in China would have to pick up a bit more so than the encouraging news that we've seen. And we probably would need to have Europe at least stabilized rather than being down a couple of ticks as it has been of late. I'm not suggesting that is our scenario. But as we look forward in this lower-growth environment, I think that midpoint mindset is probably what is most useful right now.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And I guess on that, I'm just looking for, given the many investments that you've been making in the top -- to drive the top line, if you -- to what extent externally can you sort of look at the payoff you're getting on those top line investments? And I know it's very hard to separate it from a tough macro. But what evidence are you seeing?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think in terms -- we look at those investments one by one by one, right, at the operating company level. So when we see the Dental team in China rapidly accelerating their growth and profitably so, it's an easy calculation to see those feet-on-the-street investments. When you see an uptick in R&D at Videojet and in turn the flood of new products that have come out over the last couple of years and in turn the profitable growth of returns and the market share gains at VJ, you know you're getting a return there. So not that every investment that you make is going to pay off, but I think by and large, where we are investing, we see that return not only in terms of the top line and the intended share gains, but frankly also on the gross margins.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just on Life Sciences and in general, first, just as you think about what next, I mean, one of the things that strikes me and certainly not being an expert in the area is perhaps the moves of Thermo and others are kind of fortifying kind of a distribution footprint that maybe you can't replicate. Do you view that as kind of a strategic issue to contend with? And just what is your view on kind of how maybe the channels are evolving?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, Jeff, that's probably a longer conversation than we might be do justice to this morning. But I think in Life Sciences in particular, we have a number of distributor partnerships around the world, including Thermo. But that said, the vast majority of what we sell in Life Sciences, and I'm specifically talking to the research side and the applied side of that portfolio -- that segment, not the diagnostics, we sell on a direct basis. I mean, these are not gloves and beakers that sell for 2 or 3 digits at a pop. I mean, we're talking about high-end, highly engineered, customized equipment that researchers, scientists spec out and really pushes on with respect to innovation. So those tend not to be distribution-oriented. Hence, any moves of consolidation you see there, I don't think, have a direct bearing on our competitiveness going forward.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Great. And I was just wondering what you just said to Steve on the outlook was helpful. But just thinking about the second quarter. I mean, you are basically guiding second quarter flat year-over-year but a little bit better revenue growth in Q2 than Q1, maybe some of this LS&D spending normalizes, perhaps some restructuring savings come through. What is working kind of against maybe those positives that pulled us at a roughly flat EPS result in Q2?
Daniel L. Comas: Jeff, part of it was in the quarter last year. We reported $0.84 last year, but we did call out $0.03 that's kind of one-time item. In addition, we had the Apex earnings. So absent those one-time items and absent Apex, clearly we're probably more like $0.79. So again, not talking a lot of increase, but obviously $0.80, $0.85 on a normalized basis is up a little bit versus what we really, operationally, we had last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So Larry, you mentioned a midpoint mindset, I believe. And I just wanted to clarify, is that more a core growth mindset? Or should we apply that to EPS as well?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think with respect to the quarter, perhaps the year, both.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just taking a step back. You've given some good color on the trading conditions in 1Q. But taking a step back to 4Q, obviously we have that unusual strength. And I'm just wondering how much pull-forward do you think there was from 1Q into 4Q.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I'm not sure that our view would be materially different today than it was back in the fourth quarter. Again, some of what we saw might have been a push out from the third into the fourth. So I think what we're trying to do, Nigel, business-by-business, is really take stock of the trends through that, if you will, at that 3-quarter period. But undoubtedly, we did see some softness in the quarter, I think, because of at least in Life Sciences and in Dental, some of the pull-forward. Was that 50 basis points? Was it a full point? Frankly, we haven't spent a ton of time there, let alone trying to figure out how much a day plus the Good Friday spring break dynamics at quarter end cost us in consumables. It is what it is.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Right. I know it's tough to try and organize [ph]. And then just you had mentioned $8 billion of surplus capital to redeploy. And if I go over the last 6 years and you're obviously back one, which was an unusual size, I think you deployed about $9 billion sort of the last 6 years. And I'm just wondering to deploy that sort of quantity of capital, do we need to take a big swing on the acquisition front?
H. Lawrence Culp: I don't think we see that $8 billion opportunity to deploy capital as something that requires the same check to be written. Again, I think as we look at that capacity, we really think about that as a backstop for all of these growth platforms that we have. So we've got 7 or 8 businesses here, all with their acquisition maps and funnels, and then working that accordingly. So I think our preference would be, if you're looking at $8 billion, to divvy up $1 billion to $2 billion across those businesses. And I think they all have funnels that would represent or present those sorts of opportunities. Now certainly, if something of size came along that made sense for us, we would look at it. But as you well know, if you look back over that time period, the bigger deals tend to come infrequently.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Larry, on investment, you talked about that you've got 4 consecutive quarters at low single-digit growth, nice and steady, but there's an expectation now that it ramps to mid-single-digits in 2014. So just talk a bit about what the drivers there. Is that a new product cycle?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think the view all along was that we'd have to pay off some of this inheritance tax. But by '14, we should be able to move into that mid-single-digit growth range. I really think it's nothing more than the cumulative effect of both the fixes, the quality, the service, in addition to the implementation of DBS, not only to drive cost out, but really to lay in the daily management to help drive better execution, both in sales and marketing and in new product development. As we move forward, as you see in this quarter with the launch of the DxH 600, the Power Express, we're going to get a better lift from those products. Certainly as we get behind -- we put behind some of the regulatory issues that we've had, that's going to be helpful. So I just think we've got momentum building at Beckman, momentum on a global basis, and that bodes well for that business.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then I guess it shouldn't be surprising that you called out Arbor because lots of headline news about cyber attacks. Can you just refresh us how Arbor's go-to-market strategy, how much of their product and software is off the shelf, how much of it is a customized solution and maybe the mix between government customers versus enterprise?
H. Lawrence Culp: Deane, we're well-positioned certainly in cyber security with Arbor much as we are in mobile around the mobile explosion that the carriers are enjoying. And that's on the Tektronix Communications side. At Arbor, I don't have the exact mix in front of us. I think we're more weighted toward carriers than we are enterprise. But the enterprise initiative has been clearly an important part of what we've done here in the last 2 years, and that's where we're enjoying some of the outsized growth right now as financial institutions and others wrestle with these DdoS attacks. That said, from a -- in terms of government, I just don't have that number offhand. It's -- I think it's a relatively modest portion of the business, but it is represented in the customer set.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And would this be a business that would be one of those looking for M&A opportunities?
H. Lawrence Culp: Oh, I think all of the businesses out there have their aspirations. Clearly, in security, we need to be smart about both the strategic fit of anything that we might do there, let alone valuations, of course.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So Larry, first on the Tektronix business instruments, sounded like it turned down again to down low double-digits, if I heard you right, from I think it seemed like maybe it was starting to improve a little bit last quarter. Can you maybe talk about what happened there and what the outlook is? And also maybe in the context of that business, I think that's a pretty high gross margin business. So kind of how -- what drove the gross margins sequentially, given the weakness there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Jon, you're right. We certainly saw continued softness at Tek. And as I think both Dan and I have alluded to here, that was pretty broad-based. Certainly in the first quarter here, I think we saw that particularly here in the U.S. I think what we saw at TEK was really just a continued push right in our funnels in a whole host of areas. Certainly, a number of the customers that we serve on the development side in the Tek end markets are reworking their capital budgets for this year, a little unclear as to how that plays out. As you know, this business tends to track PMI a good bit on a couple of quarter lag basis. So I think we're optimistic that we get Tek stabilized later this year. But that said, it's going to certainly be a headwind for us all in the first half. Fortunately, we've got some offsets working for us in comms and at Fluke on a segment basis.
Daniel L. Comas: And Jon, on the margin side, the gross margin side, across the company, as Larry alluded to, we've had really good performance. Given Tek Instruments, as you know, is a very high gross margin business. Gross margins were down year-on-year in Test & Measurement because of that. But in the other 4 segments, they were each up 50 to 75 basis points. Again that's a combination of some of the price/cost dynamics, the restructuring, bringing out new products. We were really pleased at Dental; we were up almost 100 basis points year-on-year in terms of gross margin. And it obviously means good execution on the cost side, but as importantly, some of these new products coming in at much better gross margins.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's very helpful. Yes, very impressive gross margin. And then if I can, just 1 follow-up kind of on the Life Science side. And some of these smaller businesses, I know you mentioned advanced staining was down, if I heard you correctly. Actually, Roche had a really tough quarter in advanced staining, too. So can you maybe -- I know there's some reimbursement and other things going on there. Can you maybe talk about your outlook for that business for the year? And then on some of these legacy Beckman Life Science businesses that actually are more distribution-related to one of the previous questions, does it make sense to maybe look to divest some of those businesses, I'm curious?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. Let me take those in order. I think we continue to have a very buoyant outlook for Leica Biosystems. Unfortunately, cancer is an issue around the world, and we're hopefully part of the solution there. You referenced the negative control guidance in the U.S. We think that probably had a little bit of impact for us in the quarter. But I think the major issue that we alluded to at Leica Biosystems was really this distribution change. In parts of Europe, we're going from a distribution model to a direct model. That creates near-term noise. As you work through that, I think it's the right strategic move to make. It will help us grow faster in Europe long-term. But clearly, we saw revenue and cost issues in the quarter as we work through that. But that will settle out, we'll be in a better place. With respect to Beckman Coulter Life Sciences portfolio, they had a nice quarter. We have a business there that I think is improving. I was with them during the quarter. We installed some new leadership, promoted Jennifer Hunnicutt [ph] into the President's role there, one of our outstanding general managers. I think we're optimistic, Jon, about that portfolio, it's clearly, if you will, the forgotten part of the Beckman Coulter. There are a number of synergies with the rest of our group. And while you're right, a number of those products go to market to distribution, they don't go to market exclusively through distribution. And I think to the extent that we innovate, we build that brand, we're going to be able to certainly compete anywhere in the world, either on a direct or a distributed basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So Larry, back in the third quarter, equipment disappointed and consumables hung in. It was kind of a similar dynamic and it was also, I think, mainly U.S.-based. And then that dynamic basically reversed in the fourth quarter, so you guys ended up missing it in the third quarter on that and beating it in the fourth on that. Is there a reason why you don't think we might have a similar just choppiness but shift quarter-to-quarter this time as a reason something keeps you more cautious about 2Q and not expecting that kind of a, I guess, catch-up that happened 3Q to 4Q?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I mean, if you're reading anything in our language or tone in that regard, it may be a function of the March macro data that came out, let alone the fact that no fun being short even of a tight 1.5% to [ph] top line range. I think that said, again as we look at the second quarter, there'll be some things that certainly help us, having the benefit of that extra day, if you will, being on the other side of the holidays, et cetera. But I think we're going to be, as we typically are, cautious, hopefully smartly so, relative to the outlook here. I think we -- again, we look at the quarter, acknowledge some of the noise but don't want to point to that. On a relative basis, we think we're doing well. And that's ultimately what's going to matter. As we move forward here, we continue to do that and make sure that we've got our investment envelope properly tuned to the environment. Clearly, little numbers matter a lot when you're talking about a couple of hundred basis points on the equipment side that can move around as it clearly has here the last couple of quarters. But that said, I think, again, we're going to move forward here with a strong competitive position, thinking that the range that we've offered up this morning, again, the midpoint perhaps being the most likely scenario for the second quarter and the second half.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. Yes, I mean, it does seem like maybe it's a function of the lower growth environment that your equipment sales are choppier than they used to be, I guess, right?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, again I think a couple of hundred basis points in growth is really the swing factor here. And it's been a noisy operating environment, as we've dealt with some of these external issues. But that said, the environment is what it is, right? So we're going to move forward.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Yes. No, I hear you. And then just quickly on China, I mean, so Med Tech remained strong, the industrial stuff, I guess, is mixed instead of all down. I mean, is there anything that's kind of taken a leg down or gotten notably worse in the quarter in China?
H. Lawrence Culp: I don't think so. We've been wrestling with these issues that Dan alluded to at T&M, particularly Tek more so than Fluke, and at Motion for some time. So it's continued to be soft. But I don't think we would characterize it as legging down in any way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So where, if anywhere in the business, did you see any impact from sort of the sequester? And how do you sort of think about that as it relates to kind of what trend you saw in March versus April? And is there any degree you can give any anecdotal conversations you've had with either customers or peers to sort of understand how that's kind of also as an overlay influencing maybe the CapEx environment?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think certainly part of the softness that we saw in the U.S. and was probably most pronounced at Leica Micro, Ross, could be attributed to just some of the noise in and around the sequester. And again it wasn't as if budgets were being slashed, projects canceled and the like. Things were just getting pushed right because of, I think, a degree of uncertainty that seemed to play out. I think we certainly saw at SCIEX some softness in the academic realm as well. And it's really with those businesses that we probably have most of our sequester exposure in Life Science. We have pockets here and there of other government exposure which could play out Tek and Motion, for example, being areas where we have that exposure. But it would be principally in LS. And again, I think it's a noise factor for us right now as opposed to any part of a clear stepdown as we look out for the rest of the year, at least at this point.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: On the capital deployment front, it's been, I think, I have to check the figures for Q1, but I think it's been a fairly quiet M&A period overall for the market, x maybe in my space, the deal this week. But I guess as you're thinking about that environment, it seems like from your characterization, it's pretty active behind the scenes. And so I guess, as you look at sort of what you've been involved in and what you've looked at that hasn't come to market, is it price? Is it timing? Is it uncertainty? And then have you seen the mix of buyers you're competing against change, e.g. is private equity a much bigger component of the process now versus where they were 12 or 24 months ago? And how are you sort of thinking about that as a changing dynamic?
Daniel L. Comas: I mean, clearly, given the better leverage markets, again what's happened in the last couple of weeks probably dampening that a little bit, we're seeing private equity more in different situations. Where we have a strong point of view about what we can do with the margin, which is I said 3 out of 4 times, let's say, private equity is probably not going to be able to displace someone like ourselves. In terms of the activity, I think the way you'd characterize it and I would think that's something we hear from not only what we're seeing but we hear from kind of bankers is the behind-the-scene discussion levels are definitely up versus where they were 6 months ago, and I think that's encouraging. Now why things don't happen, it's all over the place. It's sometimes price, it's sometimes transition issues, it's uncertainty. But normally, when we tend to see an increase in the number of discussions we're having about mid to large situations, historically, that tends to roll out into some acquisitions.
H. Lawrence Culp: Ross, I would just add to Dan's comments that if you think about situations that we've looked at where we've ultimately decided to let things go. The strategic fit, the strategic rationale is really important for us. It's got to make sense in terms of the broader strategy. And particularly in this low-rate environment, we're still, I think, primarily focused on those returns on capital as opposed to accretion. And that really has been, I think, the frame we've used over time to deploy capital. Sometimes it's led us to be quite busy and bunched up, and other times, maybe a little quieter than folks expect. But with our portfolio taking a long view through the cycle, we've tended to, I think, by and large, make good bets that have generated good returns for shareholders. I think we continue to hold that view as we look forward.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Absolutely. And maybe just one quick last one on that. I mean, to your point on return on capital versus accretion makes total sense. I mean, given your view on the year and stocks off another couple of percent today, how are you guys thinking about sort of share repurchases? And I know you bought a bit at the end of last year and then stopped. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for sort of your sensitivity and feeling on sort of the intrinsic value and your sort of openness if we go through another soft patch to maybe reconsider again sort of reentering the market.
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I think you characterized it well. We're always looking at it. We look at it opportunistically and from what sort of return sort of payback and buying back our own stock. Again, having said that, given what we potentially see on the M&A side, it's right now in secondary consideration but still something that's part of our accounting.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
H. Lawrence Culp: Thanks, Lisa. Dan and I would be around all day, everybody, for follow-ups. Thanks for joining.
Operator: And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We were pleased by the solid finish to 2012, which was broad based across most of our businesses. Core revenues grew 3.5% in the fourth quarter, with incremental strength most pronounced in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Product Identification and Dental. Additionally, the team's application of the Danaher business system led to good earnings growth, core margin expansion and outstanding cash flow performance, including a record $3 billion of free cash flow generation in the year. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew low double digits with particular strength in Latin America and the Middle East. China delivered high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, again led by Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental. In the U.S., year-end demand helped drive low single-digit growth in the quarter. Western Europe was modestly negative. Of note, revenues from the high-growth markets grew to more than 25% of our total revenues in 2012. While approximately 1/3 of this revenue is generated in China, we have also built an increasingly large presence in Latin America, with more than $750 million of annual sales; in the Middle East and Africa, with about $500 million in sales. We are proud that we have been able to replicate our success in China in other key growth markets. High-growth market revenues now surpass those from Western Europe and are a strong base for future growth and serve as a hedge against the uncertain economic outlook in Europe. In 2012, we strengthened the Danaher portfolio, spending $1.8 billion on 14 acquisitions, most notably X-Rite and IRIS. Over the next 2 years, we have ample balance sheet capacity to deploy on acquisitions with a continued focus on our strategic growth platforms, which now account for more than 90% of total revenues. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.89, representing a record fourth quarter for Danaher and a 12.5% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. Included in these results is a $0.02 per share benefit from a mark-to-market gain from the change in value of a currency swap agreement. For the full year, diluted net EPS increased 16.5% to $3.23, which includes more than $120 million of second half restructuring. Revenues for the quarter increased 5.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 3.5%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3%, partially offset by the negative impact of FX, which decreased revenues by 1%. Our full year 2012 revenues were up 13.5% year-over-year to $18.3 billion, with core revenues up 2.5%. Our year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 190 basis points to 51.2%, while our operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 80 basis points to 17.3%. For the full year, our gross margin was 51.6%, and our operating margin was 17.3%. If we exclude the impact of the Apex JV, our full year operating margin was 17%. DBS continues to be the primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. 2012 operating cash flow was $3.5 billion, a 28% increase compared to 2011. Free cash flow from continuing operations was a record $3 billion, and our free cash flow from continuing operations to net income ratio was 132%, representing the 21st year in a row where we delivered free cash in excess of net income. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of 5 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $250 million and which are expected to strengthen our Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. In 2012, we also repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of company stock at an average price of about $52 per share. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1% for the quarter with core revenues down 2%. For the full year, revenues declined 0.5%, with core revenues down 1.5%. Test & Measurement's reported operating margin was down 280 basis points to 18.7% due to both core revenue declines and higher year-on-year restructuring spending. Fluke core revenues decreased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, marking an improvement from the double-digit declines we saw earlier in the year. Bookings turned positive this quarter, and we believe this momentum could lead to positive core revenue growth in the first quarter. Fluke recently launched several new products, including the VT02 visual thermometer, an innovative entry price point temperature measurement tool with an integrated visual heat map. At Tektronix, core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate, a modest improvement from the mid-teens decline experienced in the third quarter. Sales improved sequentially in North America, although demand in Europe, Japan and China remains weak. Despite market softness, we continue to receive an industry recognition for our innovative new technologies. In the quarter, Electronics Design Network named TEK's THS 3000 handheld oscilloscope series and Keithley's 2657A high-voltage, high-power system SourceMeter to their 100 Hot Products of 2012 list. Core revenues from our communications businesses grew low single digits in the quarter led by healthy demand for our enterprise tools and network security solutions in most major geographies. Accelerated product development via DBS at Fluke Networks yielded nearly 50% product vitality in 2012, with 35 new product introductions during the year. We believe we are gaining market share as a result of this robust portfolio of fiber, WiFi and enterprise troubleshooting tools and systems. Sales at TEK Communications network management solutions declined in the quarter, primarily due to difficult prior year comparisons. We expect this business to return to growth here in the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, TEK Coms launched its Deep Packet Classification solution that enables operators to protect against revenue drain and identify new opportunities from growth -- for growth by deepening their understanding of per subscriber network utilization. Environmental segment revenues increased 5.5% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 3%. For 2012, revenues increased 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. The segment core operating margin was up 150 basis points in the quarter with reported operating margin increasing 110 basis points to 23%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. At Hach Lange, sales of our core lab instrumentation used in industrial applications were particularly good due to -- due in part to the recent launch of the DR 3900 spectrophotometer and the HQD Benchtop meter. Hach Lange again drove double-digit revenue growth in Latin America this quarter and exceeded $100 million in revenue throughout the region for the full year. ChemTreat continued its growth streak with the fourth quarter marking its 10th straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. In 2012, revenues eclipsing $350 million, up from just over $200 million when we acquired the company in 2007. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's fourth quarter core revenues grew mid-single digits, led by healthy dispenser sales in North America. In Mexico, we believe we are capturing significant market share, shipping nearly 5,000 dispensers to that country in 2012 to help customers comply with recent regulatory changes. During the quarter, Gilbarco announced the pending acquisition of Automated Fuel Systems Group, a leading provider of fuel management solutions to government fleet and mining customers in South Africa. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Navman Wireless, Danaher's first acquisition in the attractive fleet in asset management adjacency. Navman Solutions enable fleet owners and operators to track and monitor their assets real time, achieve savings on fuel and maintenance and manage operator workflows. Customers here include local business fleets, off-road users and construction and mining, schools and municipalities and long-haul transporters. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased 6.5%. Core revenues were up 7% in the quarter, and for the full year, revenues increased 40%, with core revenues up 4.5%. Our segment core operating margin was up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter. However, reported operating margin increased 120 basis points from the prior year to 14.2%. The Diagnostics businesses continued their strong performance with mid-single-digit core growth in the fourth quarter. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate, our best quarterly performance since acquiring the business. Sales were robust in the high-growth markets, particularly China, where continued government investment in healthcare infrastructure as part of the national healthcare reform has resulted in increased demand for our clinical chemistry and immunoassay analyzers, as well as our automation solutions. We remain bullish on the high-growth markets and believe that we will continue to benefit from our expanding installed base of instruments. We continue to be impressed by the Beckman team's use of DBS with noticeable improvements in quality and service contributing to improved customer satisfaction and leading to increased profitability. Radiometer's core sales increased at a low-teens rate led by solid growth of both our core blood gas instruments and AQT immunoassay analyzers. AQT's installed base now exceeds 1,000, with the number of tests per day per instrument increasing more than 20% over the past year. Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low double-digit rate with advanced staining and core histology sales up mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Growth was balanced geographically with North America, Europe and China all contributing during the quarter. We closed the previously announced acquisition of Aperio Technologies, a leader in digital pathology. The combination of Aperio and Leica Biosystems is expected to build upon our existing digital pathology innovation and go-to-market capabilities to foster better outcomes for physicians and patients alike. We also closed the previously announced acquisition of IRIS International, a leading manufacturer of automated in-vitro urinalysis diagnostic systems and consumables. IRIS' well-respected brand and market position provides an attractive entry point into this fast-growing IVD segment. Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues increased high single digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX core revenues -- core sales grew low double digits in the quarter, with particular strength in China and North America, led by the ramp in sales of our new 6500 Triple Quad system launched earlier this year. During the quarter, we also announced a -- we also opened a new application support and training center in India to assist our customers in this important growth market. Both AB SCIEX's TripleTOF 5600 and Beckman Coulter's MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter were part of a ground-breaking research initiative performed by Dr. Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan, who was recently awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in the field of medicine. Dr. Yamanaka's work aimed to reprogram adult cells into so-called induced pluripotent stem cells that can be used to cure certain diseases. This is obviously an outstanding achievement for Dr. Yamanaka, and we are proud to support his research. Leica Microsystems core sales increased at a mid-teens rate in the quarter with strong demand for our SP8 confocal microscope in most major geographies. We began shipping the SP8 modular confocal laser-scanning microscope earlier this year and are encouraged by the sales ramp-up in the past couple of months. Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 3.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 4%. For the full year, core revenues grew 3.5%. Operating margin increased 430 basis points to 15.2% in the quarter. We are particularly pleased with Dental's margin performance this year with OP margin increasing from less than 12% in 2011 to 14.5% in 2012. Dental consumables core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter led by robust global sales for our orthodontic solutions, general dentistry consumables and infection prevention products. KaVo core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate led by double-digit growth in North America. We've seen solid demand for our imaging products in the U.S. with record quarterly unit shipments of our i-CAT 3D Cone Beam imaging solution. While Europe remains weak, we are pleased by the success of our recently launched E30 mid-price point treatment unit, with more than 500 units shipped in the second half of 2012. Our Dental businesses picked up an impressive 17 Townie Choice Awards as voted on by dentists and dental practitioners in the December Dentaltown Magazine. Townie's recognized the most reliable products, and their peer-recommend products and services across the dental industry are often leading indicators of potential growth. During the quarter, we acquired Aribex, a leading provider of portable and handheld imaging systems. Handheld and portable imaginers are among the fastest-growing segments in the intra-oral imaging systems market with Aribex well positioned to capitalize on this growth as a result of its patent's intellectual property and a robust product pipeline. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segments, revenues increased 10% for the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the full year, revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 1.5%. Our core operating margin increased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter, while our reported operating margin was flat at 18.1% due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses. Product Identification core revenues grew high single digits in the quarter led by solid demand for Videojet's continuous inkjet printers in all major geographies. During the quarter, we launched 4 new products including the 1550 and 1650 next-generation CIJ printers introduced at PACK EXPO in October and a CIJ printer designed and produced in and for China to target pipe-marking applications there. Videojet has seen great success with localized products in the Asian market, introducing 5 new key printers over the past few years for that region. Esko's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter with good balance globally. At our analyst meeting in December, we showcased Esko's next-generation packaging management software, Suite 12, that targets consumer packaged good brand owners. Customer response thus far to Suite 12 has been very good. Revenues at X-Rite, our largest acquisition of the year, grew at a high single-digit rate in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago when it was a stand-alone company. If you picked up the Wall Street Journal in early December, you likely saw Pantone's 2013 Color of the Year announcement, emerald green. Response to the announcement was nothing short of extraordinary with extensive TV and print media coverage, as well as blogs, Twitter and Facebook all talking up Pantone's pick. In Motion, we saw core revenue growth at a low single-digit rate in the quarter due in part to an easy prior year comparison. Our core industrial automation and engineered solutions businesses continue to be weak. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement we've seen at Kollmorgen and by the pickup in order activity, which turned positive for the first time in over a year this quarter. However, we believe Motion core revenues will continue to decline year-over-year during the first half of 2013. So to wrap up, the fourth quarter finished obviously strongly, contributing to a solid year at Danaher. Our teams executed well amidst economic uncertainty with record free cash flow, superior earnings growth and operating margin expansion throughout the year. The structural cost actions undertaken in the fourth quarter position us well for further margin expansion and will allow us to fund growth opportunities where they present themselves. Financially, we're well positioned to take advantage of what we believe will be an attractive acquisition environment in 2013. Given that we now expect to close the pending divestiture of Apex Tool Group within the next 2 weeks and thus will have no earnings contribution either in the quarter or the full year from Apex, we are updating our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.32 to $3.47 from a previous GAAP diluted net EPS range of $3.40 to $3.55. We are initiating first quarter adjusted net EPS guidance of $0.72 to $0.77. The adjusted guidance excludes the anticipated gain on the disposition of Apex, as well as any benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of certain federal tax provisions contained in the American Tax Relief Act of 2012. We anticipate low single-digit core growth here in the first quarter.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. Charlonne, that's the conclusion of the formal comments. We're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Guys, there's a little bit of a disconnect when you think back to your Investor Day in mid-December, you were pretty cautious overall even including Life Sciences, and you came in with a pretty strong volume. And now you're getting a little bit more cautious for 1Q as far as core growth they're giving you [ph]. Was there a pull-forward at all in that last couple of weeks of December in Life Sciences or anything and related to book-to-bill that would give you some concern about the start to the first quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, I don't think in terms of the big picture there's really any change 6 weeks on here from what we said in New York in mid-December. Clearly, we finished more strongly than we had anticipated even then when we were together. But I don't think we're at a point here where we would extrapolate too much too soon from that strong finish. Clearly, we saw the new products that we launched midyear in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, particularly in Life Sciences at AB SCIEX and Leica Micro finish quite strongly, both in terms of the underlying order book but also the product we were getting out the door. I think we would also acknowledge that in Dental, another business that kind of led the way here for us in the fourth quarter, they probably saw a bit of a surge in demand at the end of the year, in part, just because of all the uncertainty around tax policy in general and the Section 179 depreciation dynamic particularly. I think if you look at the exceptionally strong finish we saw in North America in Dental equipment, particularly around imaging, it's hard not to attribute some of that to the uncertainty around the tax situation. And I think we saw a nice pickup, particularly in the U.S. It looked more like a sprint to the finish as opposed to anything we're going to call structural at this point in some of the industrial businesses. Again, we mentioned Fluke going positive in the fourth quarter. PID was quite good. So I think if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics, for example, I think that second half core growth of 3%, probably a little bit more indicative of what we we're looking at going forward, pretty much in line with that 2% to 5% guide we gave you in New York. I think Dental, again, we'd say maybe it's 1 point of a core that we'd adjust downward to try to look at the run rates given what we saw here in North America. So again, I think we're pleased with the finish. We wouldn't -- but we think it's premature to try to cast that strength too far at this point given what we have seen.
Daniel L. Comas: And Scott, the other dynamic we have in the first quarter, we have one less business day. And it probably doesn't impact much the 60% of the business that's equipment and instruments, but as we look back, it definitely impacts the 40% that's consumable. And that alone probably impacts the first quarter by 0.5 point to 1 point.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. Yes. No, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up, guys, I mean, we've seen a real pickup in China in medical spend, I think, consistently across most of the companies that we cover, and what's your experience here? I mean the sustainability. I mean there was a history in some of these markets that the government would have big spend cycles for a quarter or 2 and then not spend for another couple quarters. I mean is there something this time around that might lead us to believe that this is more of a sustainably higher level of spend that is a new trend given government initiatives? I mean how do your guys over there thinking about that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, I was in China 2 weeks ago, and we spent a fair bit of time on this subject. I think it's interesting if you just look at our own trends through the course of last year, we really saw quite the bifurcation between our industrial businesses and our healthcare businesses, both LS&D and Dental. We were basically up 20% for the full year, and we saw that strength throughout the year on the healthcare side of the portfolio. We were down nearly double digit the first half on the industrial side, and our improved overall numbers in China were a function of industrial basically getting to a flat level in the second half. I think when we look at what's happened in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, we are clearly the beneficiary of a multi-year buildout with respect to the healthcare delivery, particularly in the West but also increased utilization. And I think that will continue. That program clearly stood up when others didn't during the government transition here of late. I think on the Life Science side, we're clearly benefiting as others are from the government's effort to build out an indigenous research and development base. And I'd say that the dental market is still in its infancy, and our own execution there has gotten quite good the last couple of years, but it was an area where we had clearly underinvested and thus, underperformed. I think we see that as part of a long-term trend just given the demographics in China. So our sense is that this is not a quarter or 2, but healthcare's important for a whole host of different reasons over there, and we're well positioned. I think on the industrial side, what our folks were pointing to was, again, stability, some sequential strengthening but probably a point of view that things get better through the course of the year as we have more certainty as to who's in some of the lower-level jobs as the new regime takes shape. Once those decisions are made, we'll see hopefully an initiation of more spending than we've seen. Clearly, in infrastructure, we're keen to see some of that I think given some of the recent headlines around the environment. We'd be well positioned if that were an area where we saw increased interest both on the -- obviously on the water side. So I think our view on China for '13 is good. Again, longer-term, I just don't see these healthcare trends that we're seeing in our own numbers, Scott, tailing off. We just don't.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Wood, Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So Beckman Diagnostics, like to touch on that. Looks like that business, actually above market for the first time in quite some time in the fourth quarter. You spoke to some of the high-growth market trends, but can you speak to the developed world, what you're seeing in that business, particularly in the U.S.? And then just comment, why is a low single-digit number still relevant vis-à-vis that fourth quarter trend?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Well, I think, Jon, the outlook, as you suggest, for this year is still low single digit as opposed to mid-single. We were at low singles through the first 3 quarters and really thought that's where we would be in the fourth quarter. I would say that clearly from a geographic perspective, the growth we're seeing at Beckman is really a function of, if you will, stability in the West with strength in the high-growth markets. I think we still have work ahead of us as we pay off some of the inheritance tax here in the U.S., again encouraged by retention and win rates in that regard, but that's a multi-year effort to get what is fundamentally a business where the consumables drive the growth, and that's a function of the installed base. It's just going to take us a while to do that, though, again, we were very encouraged by the fourth quarter with respect to the AU, the new AU series. I think with respect to Europe, I don't think we're really expecting the European market to contribute to growth but stability there even if it's a low single-digit grind down. If we're executing better, as I think we will in 2013, that's not as much of a drag on us as it has been the last couple of years. So we -- maybe we're conservative with respect to what we're capable of delivering in this market in the West, but I think at least here in '13, the general mix will be similar to what we've seen. We can do better. Obviously, we'd love to do that but really see that mid-single-digit growth more in '14 than this year.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's good color. I know you're going to refrain from kind of committing on the FDA front, but anything in your correspondence with them that would suggest kind of that troponin submission is further out than we may think? Or has the feedback from that organization been just again procedural at this point? I guess I'm looking for any color you're willing to share on where we are on the troponin situation in the U.S.
H. Lawrence Culp: Jon, well, I appreciate the way you frame that because as you know, our practice has been to, I think, respect the sanctity of the dialogue with the agency and not be too public with the details. I would characterize the conversation as constructive, productive and ongoing. So we've, I think, publicly tried to avoid being too specific about where this conversation takes us and the time frame in which we get to final resolution. I think we continue to be optimistic that we will have that product on the market in the future. Again, it's tough to put a finger on the calendar as to exactly when, but we're no less convinced that, that will happen in time as we work through the topic with the agency. Again, I would reiterate that while that is an open switch here in the U.S., it continues to be a product in the market in many other places around the world. And with so many of the other improvements that we're making at Beckman in the U.S. that customers can see in terms of quality, in terms of service, other new product introductions, the way our call patterns are set up, there's just so many positive effects from the implementation of DBS that even without the troponin assay in our arsenal today, you're seeing those improvements in retention rates and win rates. So I understand the focus. It's a very fair question. But customers weigh a lot of different things when they're making a decision. And increasingly, many of those other things are in Beckman's favor, and obviously, when troponin is back on the market, that'll just be one more check on our side of the ledger, but we're not there today.
Operator: We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Larry, could you give a little more color on the positive bookings turn at Fluke, I mean, in terms of geography or end market or any other color?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I would say that really what we saw, Shannon, probably more than anything was a little bit better performance here in the U.S. I think Europe continues to be a bit of a struggle for us. I think the high-growth markets, again, broadly speaking, have continued to be really the highlight for us at Fluke. We got a little bit of a benefit, I think, as we wound down the year, as we saw some of the inventory adjustments in China really come to a close. But we're not expecting, as you know, a big pop back in T&M. Generally, Fluke will be an important part of that, but we like to think that T&M is up in line with the corporation in '13, and I think Fluke will be an important part of that on the instrument side to be sure.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then in Motion, you said the bookings there turned positive, I think. I don't know if it was for all of Motion or just Kollmorgen. Why do you expect that -- the core revenue growth to still be negative in the first half of '13?
H. Lawrence Culp: We have some tough one-off comparisons there in the Motion businesses, Shannon, and again, I think given some of the underlying demand trends that we see, I think it's going to be sluggish there through the first half where we have vertical exposure, particularly in TEK and certainly in some of the renewables. We had a very tough 2012, but we still had some business that will create a little bit of a year-on-year comparison challenge for us here in the first half as well. But hopefully, we're -- clearly, with the guide that we gave you last month, we think Industrial TEK will really be the -- probably in the 5 hole relative to performance on the core side in '13, unfortunately in part or in large part because of what we'll see at Motion. The obvious contrast there is Product ID, which finished strongly. I think it's really going to be one of our outperformers here in 2013.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. So no underlying real change in the trend in Motion then?
H. Lawrence Culp: I don't think so. I think in terms of the industrial capital equipment markets that we serve, they have been challenging. They've been challenging here to a degree certainly in Europe and in China. I think that continues here for a couple of quarters as we see it.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Larry, I was wondering if you could address deals a little bit, and really the essence of my question is just the environment and valuations. Obviously, the stock market is maybe frothy. Maybe it's not, but we've been on a nice run. So it sounds like you see things in the pipeline, but how do you balance that against valuations and the ability to kind of get things done on reasonable terms?
H. Lawrence Culp: Jeff, I think we are optimistic about getting things done in 2013. I think that's a function of the pipeline to be sure, and it's a pipeline, again, rarely dominated by public companies. I don't want to suggest that public company valuations are irrelevant to us, and I'm hopeful that we do some public company deals this year. But a fair bit of what we do is often on the private side, be it with families or independent owners and at times, PE, but PE's really not a big source for us, let alone a real competitor. I think one of the dynamics that really works to our favor is our breadth of scope and where we would like to build out. Clearly, in all 5 of our segments, we've got areas where we clearly would like to put capital to work. So when certain segments might be bid up, our discipline stays intact. We'll move into some other areas and be a bit more active there. Through a cycle, I think you see a pretty good -- you've seen a pretty good distribution of the deployment of capital. So I think in terms of how we work through that, ultimately the backstop is the discipline that I think we've demonstrated over a long period of time, strong focus obviously on the strategic quality of the business, operationally our ability to add value. But when the math doesn't work and we can't generate positive returns, cash-on-cash returns for our shareholders, I think Dan and I are very comfortable letting things go. I think it's as simple as that.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Can you give us a sense, if you have the numbers, even roughly? Maybe Dan has them. $1.8 billion spent on 2012 on 14 deals, kind of the aggregate valuation on that basket and how it stacked up [ph] relative to history?
Daniel L. Comas: It's probably in the zone of -- X-Rite would be the biggest 1, and that was sub 10x EBITDA. IRIS was -- so probably overall, I'd say about 10x EBITDA, maybe 10 to 11. I would say in that $1.8 billion of spend, and it's kind of the benefit of doing bolt-ons and that's really -- and adjacency deals, a lot of margin expansion opportunity across that revenue base. So I think that's a 10, 11x that we can get to sort of 8x without any revenue growth, and that's obviously the benefit of when we're doing these kind of bolt-on and adjacency-type deals. And if you look at -- so I feel pretty good about the valuation overall. I didn't feel like we really had to stretch for any of those deals and all sort of in that zone when we think we'll exceed a 10% return within 3 years.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Right. And just a follow-up on healthcare, Larry, you hit a lot of it with your comments a moment ago on Beckman. But just overall, as the calendar rolled over, is there a measurable sense of different momentum, whether it's a positive because of the alleviation of the uncertainty of who's President or the negative because of uncertainty about device tax? Is there -- just across the whole fleet, if you will, in the U.S., anything to discern here early on?
H. Lawrence Culp: No. Again, I think what we saw in terms of the acceleration at year end perhaps is more of a bit of uncertainty. Some of which has been addressed clearly on the tax side, but I don't think anyone is really taking too much for granted here. Clearly, the medical device excise tax is something that we're going to have to work through as are others, not only in Diagnostics but also in Dental. Really doesn't impact the Life Science space, the research space directly. So I think it's hard to discern anything that's material or structural that's different, particularly here in D.C. I think folks know that while there was some clarity in terms of who's going to be President and in the short term, clarity around fiscal policy, in many respects, that can was kicked down the road, and there are going to be open questions still to be addressed through the course of the year. But I think by and large, where we play in terms of research tools, our new product cycles position us well to get our own fair share of the spend there. Clearly on the Dental side, an improved stock market. Just a little bit of a better tone in the U.S. should help patient traffic. We can execute well there. And I think on the Diagnostics side, again, given our starting point at Beckman, we can make a good bit of our own luck there. And if you look at Radiometer and Leica Bio as an indicator of that potential, while we've never said we'll be a high single, low double-digit grower at Beckman Dx, we do think in the short-term, we can offset any headwinds that might be out there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just first question, can you give a little clarity on the 100 basis points of additional SG&A as percentage of revenue this year versus last? Just maybe dive into that, tear it apart?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I'd have to look at that off-line. I suspect part of that is the full year impact of Beckman. Last year, we only had Beckman for 6 months, and I think if we normalize that, you probably would have seen some SG&A leverage. So I think it's a little apples to oranges given the Beckman full year versus 6 months a year ago.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes, that'd be great if we could do that off-line then. I'd like to just make sure on a pro forma basis to understand what's happening on the G&A part. But overall, I mean G&A, you're not -- are you investing globally in any additional initiatives beyond expectation or where you were? Or...
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think the attitude, Steve, is still to be lean and tight from a G&A perspective, but certainly, as we've gotten bigger and the high-growth markets have become more important, we've been reshaping what constitutes, if you will, the Danaher overhead piece, so we have more capability on the ground in places like China from a Danaher perspective. Jon Clark, as you know, one of our group executives, member of the Danaher leadership team, is now in China as the President of Danaher China, really to make sure that we're doing more as Danaher China in that regard. I think similarly, as these platforms have really taken on a critical mass, there are things we're going to be able to do in Life Sciences, in Dental much as we have in Water and in T&M as a platform. Again, we want to keep the G&A lean, but I think we're also going to be putting and trying to achieve more strategically in terms of harvesting synergies at a platform level. Again, we want to avoid bureaucracy. We want to avoid undue costs, but I think these regional and platform level efforts have really paid some early dividends for us. And that's probably what's most top of mind for me and Dan as we look at the -- not only the level of the G&A spend but the nature and shape of it.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the growth side, a little more specifically, where are you in terms of the regulatory approvals for Ballast Water and on the IMO and Coast Guard? How are you thinking about that product on the approval path [indiscernible]?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, a little like other regulatory approvals, the -- while the strategic intent and the spend level is unchanged, the time frame there relative to our certifications is a bit more unpredictable, Steve. But clearly, the internal testing that we've talked about at Trojan is underway. I think we're hopeful that some of that, the validation work in essence is completed here in the first half of 2013. We did get our first installation late last year. Pleased with that. But it's been a bit unpredictable, which is why we really haven't laid in a lot in terms of '13 contribution at Trojan from Ballast Water.
Operator: Next, Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Can you talk about maybe some of the new product momentum you're seeing in some of the key businesses, whether it's on the Life Science side or also in the T&M business?
H. Lawrence Culp: Ross, I'm sorry, I didn't catch the first part of your question. Could you please...
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Sorry, new product momentum, new launches, sort of key things to look out for over the course of the year in terms of contributing to growth sort of outside, just the macro.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think we, again, are clearly in Life Sciences, particularly in a very strong new product position. I think at SCIEX with the 4500, the 6500 you're seeing strong traction, that's something to watch. That's not a 1-quarter dynamic. I think similarly at Leica Micro, we're in a good place. The SP8 will continue to be an important growth driver for us as we ramp there, and that's really the way I would think about Life Sciences. Again, Diagnostics, as you well know, is a little bit tougher to turn. But I think as we ramp the AU series, the new clinical chem family at Beckman, we're going to be in particularly good shape. And as you go to the shows this spring, ASMS and the like, I think you're going to see SCIEX, Leica, Beckman all continue to launch really a steady bucket of new product introductions. I think in T&M, again, I think at Fluke, particularly in thermography, we're encouraged by the early response to this new visual thermometer. There are other products that we plan to get out in '13, really in the back of the -- some of the technology that was brought in last year. I think in T&M, particularly on the scope side, we're in a good place. We've talked about some of the awards that we've seen with the launches that are still due to ramp through the course of 2012, and there's more to come in that regard. Clearly, innovation is important in both of those segments. We'll continue to invest in R&D, spend a lot of time deploying the DBS tools to accelerate those product launches and drive as much commercialization success as we can.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And -- great. Maybe just one other quick one. So I'm looking at sort of indication on the stock this morning. It's off a couple bucks. I'm looking at my inbox. People are obviously talking about sort of the guidance commentary, and I think in general, it's very consistent with what you talked about at JPMorgan not long ago. I mean, as we think about sort of the progression over the year, really, is it just sort of we're early in the year, sort of a function of we're just starting to maybe turn a bit on the cycle, and we're not sure where we are. I mean, what are you looking for on either the macro front or just within the business in terms of getting more comfortable and maybe a more constructive outlook in terms of core growth in the business for the year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Ross, again, I think you're spot on. We're trying this morning not to say anything that is fundamentally different than what we said in New York in mid-December or what we said at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month. I think we're pleased certainly with a stronger finish to the year. I think we're acknowledging some of that might have been a pull-forward from 2013. But I think all things being equal, we think we're looking at a challenged growth environment in the West, one that's getting better and the one could continue to improve sequentially through the course of the year. But it's not going to be a high-growth market story for us as it will be for most companies. In terms of increasing our guidance in any form, I think 6 weeks on is just, again, premature. But we'll certainly, as is our practice, literally look at everything, how China's ramping not only in terms of what we're shipping but order books, other leading indicators, looking at POS and T&M, particularly on the instrument side, will be another important marker for us. But I think that the way we're going to operate in this environment is really no different than way we've operated before in terms of recognizing the macro reality and the challenges that are out there and trying to make as much of our own luck as we possibly can. But again, there's no change here from what we said earlier this month, let alone the middle of last month.
Daniel L. Comas: And I think we're pleased with the restructuring we got done here in the fourth quarter as Larry alluded to, over $120 million. I think we're going to track well to those savings here in 2013. And one of the challenges that we had was the Test & Measurement segment margins, particularly in the second half, which were down like 300 basis points year-on-year. That's going to get better here, and both because growth is getting a little better there, but also because that segment had a disproportionate amount of the restructuring here. I think we're feeling better about how T&M is shaping up here early in the year.
Operator: We'll go next to Julian Mitchell, Crédit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. I guess just firstly, when you think about the gross margin, you've had 3 years in a row now where it's been above kind of 50%. It's up the last couple of years, and you've done a bunch of restructuring. So when you think sort of longer-term -- I mean do you think that kind of mid-50s run rate is achievable, obviously, depending on timing of and size of deals?
H. Lawrence Culp: Julian, I think we do have gross margin expansion potential here. As Dan just highlighted a moment ago, clearly, one of our higher gross margin businesses, certainly one of our higher BCM businesses, T&M, had a tough 2012, and they're back on a more normal trajectory. That's accretive in that regard. Clearly, as we drive the installed bases of these new products in LS&D, we get good gross margin sales in the short term, but overtime, as those -- as that installed base grows and the higher-margin consumables course through those instruments, that helps us as well. You're right. We've done a lot of restructuring the last few years. We don't have a lot teed up here in the next 90 to 120 days, but there's always structural costs still to come as well. So I wouldn't put a target out there because as you alluded to, the next acquisition may come in, in a way that helps or hurts the gross margin temporarily. But I don't think we've, in any way, pinned the gross margin number on the ceiling here just yet.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just in terms of your own plans around R&D and CapEx, I mean R&D to sales is sort of flattish at about 6% in the quarter in the last couple of years. Is that a good run rate going forward? And then on CapEx, that was up by about 5%, I think, in Q4. How are you feeling about your CapEx plans for the year ahead?
H. Lawrence Culp: Julian, we certainly focus on the R&D figure more so than we do the CapEx. I think CapEx is probably going to be in, what, $550-ish million range this year, just to give you a number there. I don't think, again, from an R&D perspective when you look at where we finished and where we're likely to be 6, 6.5 in that band, that we're really managing R&D with those ratios foremost in our minds. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that strategically we know what we need to be doing to drive growth, investing in both technology and new product development and then positioning ourselves to fund those programs within businesses across the portfolio that represent the best opportunities for us. And if that means we ought to spend a little bit more or we could spend a little bit less, we'll do that. I don't think we're of the school that you really want to just manage R&D through that ratio because you can end up, I think, spending money that you don't necessarily need. But clearly, part of what we did with the restructuring, as we alluded to through the course of last year, was to set ourselves up this year to increase any growth funding, be it R&D, be it on the sales and marketing side as well perhaps, that might be warranted as opportunities come forward.
Operator: We'll have our last question from Deane Dray, Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: We're coming down to the wire on Apex. Can you just remind us the after-tax proceeds, the gain and then the use of the proceeds? I know we've -- you've baked in some buybacks already, but just those targets for 2013.
Daniel L. Comas: Sure, Deane. The -- our half of the JV, we expect gross proceeds of about $800 million, after-tax proceeds of a little bit over, I think, $650 million. We'll report a gain of about $0.19 a share here in the first quarter. Given we've -- we purchased about 12.5 million shares of stock here in the second half of last year in the kind of low 50s, I think our expectation is the lion's share is close to targeted towards May here in '13.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then, Larry, in terms of the Water side of Danaher, the 2 businesses that I'd like to touch on, 1 is on ChemTreat, very quiet success story, 10 quarters of double digits. Just remind us what the strategy there has been because a lot of people thought this is a chemicals business, but it's more of a solutions business. But you've grown this gain share over this time period and just you're targeting specific end markets that are more attractive. That's first question. And then second one on Trojan, some pushouts in the third quarter, didn't sound like that repeated in the fourth quarter, just give us some update on that, too, please.
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. You bet. Well, I think that at ChemTreat, the story in many respects is a simple one. This is a business, largely a domestic business, that has just done over time before we were involved, but clearly, over the last 10 quarters, an exceptional job of taking very good care of their customers. You're right. They transact typically through the supply of water treatment chemicals, but what they -- what customers really buy though is the expertise, the service and the quality of the support that their local ChemTreat team provide. I think being in a position where we've been able to build that team over time continue to enhance the overall service and quality levels of the business has really been just a daily execution story, much more so than any grand strategy. And again, our hats are off to the team at ChemTreat. They've just been outstanding partners with us, and we're really proud of the results they've delivered. Trojan's been another very strong story for us, going through I think a couple of tough quarters here to be sure as we've seen some of the bigger projects roll off around the world and at the municipal market, particularly around some of the bigger-ticket capital programs, tighten up here. But I think as we look forward at Trojan, continue to be convinced around the UV disinfection opportunity. Trojan's position, I think you know, Deane, better than anybody, the Ballast Water opportunity is out there. I think it's going to come, just a matter of getting the timing down. So there's some uncertainty in the short term, but I think longer term, again, that's going to be a meaningful opportunity for Trojan on top of what they do today for their municipal and their industrial customers.
Operator: And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. McGrew to offer any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks for joining us, everybody. Dan and I are around here in the morning for follow-ups.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Given what was clearly a difficult operating environment during the third quarter, our team did an outstanding job on the execution front with a 100-basis point increase year-over-year in our core operating margin and a 50% year-over-year increase in our free cash flow during the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, our trailing 4 quarters of free cash flow exceeded $3 billion. We grew 1% organically in the quarter with sales in Western Europe declining at a mid-single digits rate and the U.S. modestly negative, both of which were slightly below our expectations. Despite these macro pressures, we successfully protected our organic investments and stayed active on the M&A front, announcing $500 million of new acquisitions. In addition, during the quarter, we purchased approximately 5 million shares of company stock at an average price of approximately $52 per share. We saw the positive impact of DBS on growth in a number of our businesses, including Esko, Leica Biosystems and Hach. Especially in this environment, we are focusing our efforts on capturing market share. In the quarter, DBS helped to accelerate new product introductions across many of our businesses, and coupled with our go-to market initiatives, drove share gains at Videojet, ChemTreat, Tektronix Communications, Radiometer and Kerr to highlight a few specific operating businesses. Geographically, the emerging markets grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. China was also up low-double digits, though sequentially we did not see any improvement in industrial and user demand. Health care remains a bright spot in China with our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses growing in excess of 20% in the quarter. Turning to the details of the quarter. Today we reported record third quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.77, a 7% increase as compared to our adjusted diluted net EPS last year. We delivered this increase in earnings despite the fact that quarterly revenues declined slightly to $4.4 billion due to the negative impact of currency translation, which reduced sales by 3%. Core revenues grew 1%, and the impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 1.5%. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 51.6%, and our reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%. DBS remains the key driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. Third quarter operating cash flow was $975 million, a 42% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2.3 billion, up 37%. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the first 9 months of the year was a robust 140%. Across each of our growth platforms, we are active and optimistic on the M&A front. Through the first 9 months of the year, we've already deployed more than $1 billion of capital on 10 acquisitions and have reached agreement to acquire 2 additional businesses for another $500 million this quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the pending sale of Apex Tool Group, our strategic joint venture with Cooper Industries, to Bain Capital for $1.6 billion. We expect the sale to generate after-tax proceeds to Danaher of approximately $650 million and to close in the first half of 2013. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to 2013 net earnings per share by approximately $0.08 until we redeploy that capital. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement segment revenues declined 5% in the quarter with core revenues down 6.5%. Core operating margin for the third quarter decreased 320 basis points while reported operating margins declined 390 basis points to 20.1%, primarily a result of the lower sales volumes in our instruments businesses. Instruments core revenue declined at a low-double digit rate. At Fluke, core revenues were down double digits. While demand there was healthy in Latin America and in the Middle East, it was more than offset by continued weakness in other geographies, primarily China. Despite the difficult environment, we continue to protect and nurture the growth investments in the business, and in the quarter expanded the range of Fluke's front-line industrial maintenance and troubleshooting tools with the launch of the 805 Vibration Meter. At Tektronix, core sales declined at a midteens rate with further weakening globally across the business. Tektronix recently introduced the next phase in our award-winning MDO product portfolio, the MDO4000, a lower price point model of our all-in-1 oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer targeting design engineers across a broad range of applications. Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, driven by demand for Tektronix Communications' mobile network management solutions in North America and China. We expect core growth rates in our Communications businesses to decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of a large carrier project from last year that is winding down. Demand for our network security systems is particularly strong in light of recent high-profile DdoS attacks. As a result, enterprise customers across many sectors are seeking to fortify their network security defenses. Turning to Environmental. Revenues increased 2.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 3.5%. The segment core operating margin increased 70 basis points in the quarter with reported operating margins essentially flat, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water quality core revenues increased at a low-single digit rate in the quarter. Hach core revenues grew mid-single digits with solid demand in all major geographies and across most verticals. Municipal spending for our core lab and process instrumentation was up low-single digits globally. Hach remains focused on expanding its service capabilities, doubling its service revenues as a percent of sales over the last several years. Today, consumables and service represent 55% of our water quality group's total revenues. During the quarter, we acquired Dingli, a Chinese distributor of online water quality instrumentation. This is our first water quality acquisition in China and provides Hach with both engineering and integration capabilities, which will help drive growth in our process business. The third quarter marked ChemTreat's ninth straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Our best-in-class sales force initiatives continue to capture market share with several new account wins during the quarter. Trojan core revenues declined in the quarter as municipal spending for capital equipment remained weak. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low-single digits, led by robust demand for our dispensers in Latin America driven by anti-tampering security regulations in Mexico. In addition, the Encore 700, our highly flexible EMV-ready dispenser designed to support security upgrades for credit and debit cards in North America, which we launched at the end of last year, continues to see strong adoption and now represents over 30% of Gilbarco's U.S. sales. CSP Magazine, the convenient store trade publication, recently awarded Gilbarco their 2012 Retailer Choice Best New Product in technology category for its Applause TV dispenser, which enhances customer loyalty and increases store traffic. During the quarter, Gilbarco acquired ACIS Group, an Eastern European provider of products and services to the retail and commercial petroleum industry. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter decreased 3% due to the impact of currency exchange rates and a small divestiture. Core revenues were up 2.5%. Core operating margin for the segment was up 320 basis points while our reported operating margin increased 890 basis points from the prior year to 12.2%. The Diagnostics businesses continued their strong performance with mid-single digit core growth in the third quarter. Radiometer's core sales increased at a high-single digit rate with growth in all major geographies and solid placements of both our core blood gas instruments and our new AQT immunoassay analyzers. AQT unit sales were up more than 25% from a year ago. During the quarter, we received an order from a large German dialysis company to place 250 ABL90 blood gas analyzers in clinics throughout the country. This contract runs for 5 years and is expected to result in over 1 million tests per year. Leica Biosystems sales increased at a mid-single digit rate with advanced staining in core histology sales up low teens and mid-single digits, respectively. Growth was balanced geographically with North America, Europe and the emerging markets all contributing. At the National Society for Histology Convention in Vancouver this month, Leica Biosystems showcased 6 new products, the most of any presenting company to show, further emphasizing our commitment to innovation. One of the products we debuted was the BOND advanced software package, which allows multiple advanced staining instruments to run from one central control panel, thereby increasing efficiency for busy lab technicians. As we discussed in our Leica Investor Day last year, digital pathology is an increasingly important element in the path lab as advanced staining is driving therapeutic treatment options and increasing the need for more advanced image analysis. So during the quarter, we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of Aperio Technologies, a leader in this market with a full range of products covering scanning, managing, viewing and analyzing images. The combination of Aperio and Leica Biosystems strengthens our position in digital pathology with considerable innovation and go-to-market synergy potential to serve doctors and patients better and to fuel strong organic growth. We are pleased with our progress at Beckman Coulter where DBS has made an impact on many facets of the business, including new product introductions, sales and marketing and quality, all the while improving the overall cost structure. Diagnostics again grew at a low-single digit rate organically, the fourth consecutive quarter of low-single digit growth. While modest, the sustained growth we've seen over the last year has encouraged us that this business, once fully up on its feet, will be a strong contributor to Danaher's overall core growth. Beckman's launch of the AU5800 series, a new high-volume clinical chemistry analyzer, while still early, is going well with encouraging initial customer feedback. As production and placements ramp over the remainder of the year, we expect the 5800 to be a key driver of growth in 2013 and beyond. During the quarter, we announced the pending acquisition of IRIS International, a leading manufacturer of automated in-vitro urinalysis, diagnostic systems and consumables. IRIS' well-respected brand and market position provides an attractive entry point into this fast-growing IVD segment. This transaction is expected to close before year end. Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues declined low-single digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX's core sales grew low-single digits in the quarter with particular strength in China. We began shipping the 6500, our most sensitive triple quad system, which we launched at ASMS in June. The 6500's ability to increase our customers' research and experimentation capabilities has resulted in very good feedback from initial users, and we expect shipments to increase through the balance of this year. Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits in the quarter with soft demand in North America and Europe as the pace of activities slowed across a number of customers. Earlier this year, we debuted the SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope, a truly innovative new technology. We began shipments late in the second quarter and expect to see a ramp over the next several quarters. In Dental, revenues for the quarter decreased 1% due to the adverse effect of currency exchange rates. Core revenues were up 3%. Core operating margin increased 90 basis points, and reported operating margin increased 100 basis points to 15.5%. We are pleased both with the team's execution and the relative stability of the overall dental market. Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits in the quarter, led by sales of our general dentistry consumables and orthodontic solutions across all major geographies. Our Kerr brand continues to take share as a result of a robust new product portfolio and strong commercial execution around the world. Dental equipment core revenues increased low-single digits in the quarter with growth in instruments and equipment. This month we launched the KaVo E30 treatment unit, an extension of our successful E70 and E80 lines, which allows doctors to flexibly match their treatment units with desired instrumentation. We are quite happy with our performance in China as our combined equipment and consumables go-to-market initiatives resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth. These joint efforts in China are a model for our Dental businesses globally as we accelerate their emerging market penetration. In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 1.5% for the quarter. Our core operating margin increased 120 basis points while our reported operating margin declined modestly to 21.8%, primarily due to the impact of recently acquired acquisitions. Product Identification core revenues were up low-double digits in the quarter with growth across most major geographies. Sales of Videojet's CIJ printers were particularly strong, up greater than 10% in the quarter. We launched the Videojet 3020 laser coder, an entry level laser for marking and coding applications in the consumer packaged goods in industrial products markets. At Esko, core sales grew more than 10% in the quarter with strength across all major product categories. The consumer packaged goods industry continues to look for Esko to help fulfill their packaging design needs, which helped drive midteens growth in our software business in the quarter. Despite the economic headwinds in Europe, Esko's sales there grew high-single digits, due to a healthy order book following the drupa trade show in the second quarter. X-Rite, our largest acquisition year-to-date, is off to a solid start with several new products set to be introduced here in the fourth quarter. Collaboration between X-Rite and Esko has already begun with both teams excited to leverage opportunities to work together. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a high-single digit rate in the quarter with weakness in most major geographies. We continue to see softness in Industrial automation, engineering solutions and technology markets across most major geographies. We expect core sales to improve in the fourth quarter in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons. So to wrap up, our team continues to execute well. While the impact of DBS is evident in the share gains we saw across a number of businesses, clearly the macroeconomic headlines are having an impact on our growth. We're mindful that the operating environment is likely to remain challenging going forward, and as a result, we are increasing our previously announced 2012 anticipated restructuring efforts from approximately $100 million to approximately $120 million. We believe our strong recurring revenue base, now 40% of total revenues, and our efforts to reduce our structural costs along with the margin expansion opportunities present in our newer businesses and investments in growth initiatives, should position us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond. We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.80 to $0.85, as well as adjusting our full year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $3.19 to $3.26 to a new range of $3.14 to $3.19. The midpoint of our revised GAAP EPS guidance would result in approximately 12% year-over-year growth compared to 2011 adjusted EPS of $2.83. We are assuming fourth quarter 2012 core revenue will be similar to what we have seen in the third quarter.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Deana, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First, we'll hear from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So Larry, so the U.S. going a little bit negative. I mean, I guess, how much of that surprised you and maybe talk about some of the key drivers and what you think's behind that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I think this -- we wouldn't isolate, Shannon, the U.S. I think it was really from a geographic perspective, both a U.S. and a Western European dynamic here. I think we've said for many years that the third quarter is often about September, certainly given the weak summer that we and others saw. That was all the more true here in the third quarter. We saw an uptick in September. We just didn't see a big enough uptick relative to expectations and again, in a real contrast, I think, to the high-growth markets where we saw that low-double digit growth. I think when you look at it from a product perspective, it's interesting because from a -- consumables were pretty much right where we thought they'd be. We thought they'd be around 4% core. They were, and again that's about 40% of our overall revenue. I think where we saw the swing was really in the bigger ticket capital purchases where, I think, we pegged the U.S. and Europe to be up slightly and it ended up in both places being down slightly. And again, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, Shannon, it was principally in Instruments, Fluke and Tek, certainly saw that in Motion where we're serving bigger ticket capital investments. At Trojan, we saw things soften and push out again kind of big ticket muni spending. And in Life Sciences, I think we saw some of the academic and government spending pressures to a degree. So we're really talking about a couple of hundred basis points of a swing there around, if you will, kind of Western market capital spend.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And as you're sort of launching new products with -- things like AB SCIEX and some of the things that have come out, I mean, are those kind of initial launches not what they used to be? And what are you hearing from customers in terms of any deferral? I mean, are -- is there interest, but they're saying check me again in 3 to 6 months or sort of what's the nature of the feedback?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I would say with the new products, and particularly in Life Sciences, we really couldn't be better positioned. And I think if you look at SCIEX, for example, we continued to ramp around the new products, particularly the 6500 on the high end, the 4500 in the mid-price point range. Talked about the new confocal at Leica, the SP8. So those conversations are -- they couldn't be going better, Shannon. And I think that's why we're alluding to these shipment start-ups and these ramps around products that we really put out in the market in the first half of the year. Those, by and large, have been good conversations. I think it's more, if you will, the bread-and-butter products and programs where we've seen some of the pressure that we're alluding to, again, primarily in the U.S. and in Europe.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, great.
H. Lawrence Culp: Innovation, particularly in life science research is the -- it's the name of the game. And fortunately, I think, we're in a good position in that regard. We just got to get a little bit more time behind us to get these products ramped.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you just talk about what's going on in Life Sciences? I guess, the little bit weaker performance there and the margin is also a bit of a disappointment. Is there anything specific that we should watch out for that's going to be part of this restructuring over the next few quarters that you would expect improvement on there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, let me break it down in terms of the top line, margins and restructuring. If we start with Life Sciences again, Life Science as a group was down low-single digits, I think a real contrast to the mid-single digit growth we saw in Diagnostics, which continue to be, I think, very strong. Again, I think with AB SCIEX and with Leica, which are the 2 engines there of course, we saw academic and government spending be more muted here in the second half than we were anticipating. And we've seen that in the wake of some of the austerity, some of the sequestration concerns that are out there. As we ramp some of these new products, we'll get some benefit to offset that more modest spending environment. But I really think that's largely what we're talking about here, Steve, in terms of what we're seeing in Life Sciences. It's largely a Western dynamic. I think we help ourselves a good bit as we get these new products out the door. But again, as we flag a fourth quarter growth rate in line with what we've seen here in the third, it's in part due to a view that the spending environment in and around some of these bigger ticket items will be less robust in the short term than it would normally be.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Why does that get better? I mean, isn't there a risk that, that gets actually worse if these guys don't get together and get something done here near term? I mean, isn't that kind of a -- what's kind of the worst case for that related business for next year in case something happens here with the cliff that's coming up?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I -- my view, Steve, and this is maybe one of the few times we get the benefit of being here in Washington, talking to a lot of folks out, say, at the NIH up on the hill. I think regardless of how the election plays out, regardless of which party's in charge, I think there's a view that the U.S., much like China, much like Germany, needs to invest in life science research. It's the right thing to do. It's a source of national competitive advantage. So I don't think we worry so much about the long-term worst case. I think what we're seeing is a -- is more temporary given the strategic long-term interests that these customers, be they government or nongovernment, have in mind. And again, to the earlier question, as we continue to fuel innovation, like the 6500 and the 4500, it's SCIEX, the SP8 at Leica, Navios at Beckman and flow cytometry, I think we'll be well positioned to take share of the spending that is left out there around the world.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But I guess, as you contingency plan for next year, is this a business that could possibly be down double digits in a worst case scenario?
H. Lawrence Culp: I don't think that is in our planning scope at this point, Steve, in any way, shape or form.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question just on you guys buying back stock. Just maybe what's the -- how did that decision -- how'd you come to that decision, and does that reflect on perhaps a lack of acquisition opportunities out there? I mean, historically, you guys have been pretty good buyers of your stock. It's performed well after you've bought it. I'm just curious as to with such a lack of visibility out there on the macro, why step up and do it now.
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I think it's -- clearly, the bias is to the M&A side. And as Larry alluded to, we've spent about $1.5 billion year-to-date on M&A. The buyback represented about 1/6 of that amount, but we do, as you pointed out, we do periodically go in and buy back some stock. You'll remember we issued about 20 million shares last year, so it's an opportunity to sort of bring some of that stock back in. And in terms of -- hard to read EPS within a couple of cents, but that's not really how we look at the buyback. We look at it on a cash basis. So we issued the stock last year at $52. At that point, our free cash flow was about $2.21 billion. And we were able to buy that stock back at an average price of $52. And right now our free cash flow is $3 billion, up 40%. So it just seemed like a good investment and a good opportunity to take some of that stock back. But clearly the bias is on the M&A side.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: For the expectations on the M&A side, I know we've talked about the interest in rebalancing the portfolio more towards the -- or lowering the Life Sciences, Dental, Med Tech to closer to 40%. IRIS came up. It looked like a nice tuck-in for Beckman, but how are you thinking about the mix versus what you look in the funnel of potential M&A opportunities?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, Deane, let me hit maybe on 3 points. First, I think the intent today is just as you described it. I think we would be very keen to put the next $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion to work predominantly outside of Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental. I think as we look forward, we want to maintain that balance. We think that serves the company and shareholders very well. I think as you look inside the funnels, to your specific question, we're active in a whole host of areas in that regard. So I think we continue to be optimistic. Per Dan's comments a moment ago, we'll be able to deploy capital in that direction in a serious, meaningful way. Third point I'd make is that, certainly, as you can appreciate, IRIS coming on board is a wonderful addition. Urinalysis is one test modality that Beckman is not in today. I think IRIS, through our global distribution channels, will be a significant contributor going forward. Clearly, digital pathology is a core trend of the future in and around one of our most successful businesses, that being Leica Biosystems. And if Leica can come anywhere close to doing in digital pathology with Aperio what they were able to do at Vision Systems in advanced staining, I think we'll be very happy. That said, let's keep in mind that if you step back on just the spend here in 2012, at least the commitment, we're talking about $1.5 billion and I think just over $1 billion is outside of Life Sciences and Dental. So we're very happy with what we've done with X-Rite and Product ID. We've made some important additions to the Communications business at Tek Comms and so forth. So I think the intent is as it was. I think the funnel's in good shape. And if you look at the body of work so far this year, a couple of nice life science additions to be sure, but I think you see that intention very much playing out with the capital decisions we made.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And just as a follow-up and since we're on the topic of the M&A funnel and you and I have spoken about this before, but just like to hear an updated thought process about Danaher's potential interest in specific Software-as-a-Service type of businesses. And clearly, so much of Danaher businesses today already have embedded software whether it's Esko or Tek Communications. But are there opportunities for Danaher to look into specific stand-alone Software-as-a-Service? And what would be the mindset and evaluation expectations for those types of businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, Deane, I think the short answer is yes. Because as you rightly point out, whether it's what we've seen at Esko, what we're increasingly doing at Tek Comms, software is not only a critical component of the value we create for our customers, but the business models around how we deliver that value are evolving and whether it's Software-as-a-Service or some of those other Web-based or cloud-based models, I think you are going to see that being of increased importance, and thus, interest to us. I suspect you can see us approach this not only inorganically but organically as well. We're a week away from completing our strategic plan reviews for all the businesses. This was a common theme of opportunity as we look to extend our hardware- or equipment-based value props in just a whole host of places, some of which you actually might be quite surprised to see. In terms of valuations, obviously, the valuation parameters we've talked about in the past, I think, are going to hold here. I don't think in any way we would see different business models really requiring us to depart from, frankly, some old school math in terms of cash-on-cash returns. But as we've seen thus far, as we look forward, we think we'll be able to do that. So I don't think you'll see 10 of the next 10 deals be SaaS-based transactions, but clearly that's the way the world's moving and those sorts of additions to the portfolio will be strategically important and I think value enhancing along the way.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jon Wood from Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So Larry, thanks for the update on the Beckman top line experience there. Could you offer us an update on how the margin trajectory looks for that business as well as cash flow? Just where you are from a synergy perspective and how you're tracking relative to the plan you laid out at the December Analyst Day.
Daniel L. Comas: Jon, this is Dan. Maybe I'll add just a few facts and let Larry add a little bit of color. I mean, we continue to track quite well, up 400 or 500 basis points year-on-year. We will do the $120 million of restructuring in the fourth quarter. It will be broad-based, but Beckman and others will clearly be part of that and we expect some additional opportunity from that as well in terms of higher margins going into '13. As you know, in the procurement side in a regulated industry, things can take longer. That was part of our plan. We're making progress there. Again, you'll see some of that benefit. So we clearly will achieve the $250 million of cost savings that we thought we would have in '12 and believe there's another $100 million of costs to come out and margin improvement between '13 and '14. So I think we're pretty well positioned. From a cash flow perspective, it's just -- it's been terrific. We've taken out about $175 million of capital out of the business through the first 9 months of the year. That's on top of a pretty large number in the second half of last year. So the cash flow at Beckman has just been extraordinary.
H. Lawrence Culp: Jon, I would just add to that, that clearly, as you well know, the foundation of that strong initial financial performance is what we're doing from a quality, from a service perspective first and foremost. We've had a number of the key facilities, Brea, Chaska reinspected without incident. Very encouraged by that. Obviously, we've got the troponin submissions into the FDA. We were out a fair bit over the last 6, 7 weeks for some strategic reviews. We had the board out, in fact. Just the core DBS implementation around service calls and past dues. Service calls, for example, unscheduled calls down 20% from a year ago. Just a lot of good improvements that we see in our metrics there that customers are beginning to see. In the prepared remarks, we flagged the progress we're making on the growth side. Again, we're not going to try to get too far ahead of ourselves but encouraged by what we're seeing, not only in retention, but increasingly the [indiscernible] opportunities we get for new business where we are not the incumbent on the back of some of these improvements. And as we get outside of the U.S. and we get outside of Western Europe, clearly the high-growth markets continue to really contribute to the overall performance that we're seeing. We had, for the first time, all the Diagnostics businesses together out in Brea, looking at some of the strategic synergies, both top and bottom line. That was a great week to have Radiometer and Leica Biosystems in addition to Beckman together. So we're excited about where we are, but I'd say all the more excited about the future in and around Beckman and the Diagnostics group.
Operator: We'll hear next from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Just a couple kind of random things here. Just back on margins, Test & Measurement, the decremental seemed very severe there. Was there something particular going on with mix or restructuring or something in the quarter? Can you just elaborate a little bit more there?
Daniel L. Comas: Jeff, the reported -- if you just look at the base numbers, it was almost 100%. But if you strip out acquisitions and FX, it was 60%, still a high BCM on that. It is our highest gross margin business and our highest BCM business. Clearly, we're doing some restructuring. We'll do more restructuring here in the fourth quarter. That's an element of it. We are also sustaining investments across a number of our T&M businesses. So I think as we get through some of the restructuring here in the second half, that BCM degradation will decline and again we're -- I think we're of the view that this is not going to be as pronounced a downturn as we saw a couple of years ago.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: So you are expecting the business revenues declining into the fourth quarter again?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, we are. Yes.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And just back to the questions on Beckman. So you're getting a lot of year-over-year margin improvement, but did the margins improve sequentially? Obviously, the segment overall did have organic growth, although you had some weak spots, but the margins were down sequentially in the segment aggregate.
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, we were down, I think, 80 or 90 basis points. There was a little bit of -- there was a write-down of an investment that Beckman had made prior to our acquisition that impacted margins a little bit in the quarter. And the biggest impact on margins is the fact that Life Science was down not only at Beckman, but broad based we were down at LSD. So our Diagnostics margins were up year-on-year, but the sequential decline was really driven by Life Science where the core growth was negative.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And just on the restructuring, Dan, do you expect to get dollar-for-dollar payback next year or does it spread into '14? How do we think about that?
Daniel L. Comas: The $120 million, we should get about a $90 million payback. And maybe, maybe we don't get all of that in Q1, but by Q2 we think we'll be fully ramped on that. So we'll get the 95% of that here in '13 is our expectation at this point.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Okay. And then just finally, is there a desire to retire that entire 20 million shares that are related to the Beckman deal?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, you knew I'll give the same answer as M&A. I mean, we don't have a plan there. We will continue to look at it periodically and opportunistically.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wanted to focus on a couple of the bright spots first. The free cash flow was exceptional and it sounds like from your comments, Dan, that a lot of that was due to Beckman Coulter. So I'm wondering how much of that 130% or so of conversion was driven by -- or has been driven by Beckman Coulter this year.
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. If you look at our year -- our 9-month performance where our free cash flow to continuing net income, it's about 140%. If I took away the $170 million of capital we've taken out of Beckman, it'd still be 130%. Now even if we own Beck, say, we're 3 years from now, we're not going to get $170 million, but we'd still expect, say, $50 million. But if I take that all, put it on the sidelines, we'd still be 130% conversion. We're seeing broad-based, very good cash flow across our businesses.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So the message is more to come from Beckman, but perhaps not $170 million?
Daniel L. Comas: That's right.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And Larry, how do we think about China here? Because China was up low-double digits versus fairly flat in 2Q. Do you feel that double digit is sustainable from here?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think, Nigel, we are more the beneficiaries of easier comps right now than we are any pronounced pickup in China. So we're thrilled to be back, printing double-digit deltas here. I suspect we'll be close to being able to do that in the fourth quarter again. But I think until we get into '13, until they're on the other side of at least their transition and perhaps are pulling a few more policy levers than they pulled this year, I think that's really going to be the dynamic. The comps will make us look better, but we'll be fighting for business virtually everywhere. The export base there, as you know, is soft, in part as a function of their exposure to Europe. We feel that probably most in Instruments, particularly at Tektronix and probably to a degree in Motion. We're very pleased again with both Life Sciences & Diagnostics as well as Dental. Don't really see any reason that, that would in a pronounced way slow and we would expect, given their 5-year targets, for that to be another highlight in '13. But otherwise, I think we're probably, certainly like many others, of a more cautious view in the short term relative to China, certainly in contrast to perhaps where we were in the springtime.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just finally, could you help us think about 4Q in terms of obviously September was a bit softer. How does that flow through into 4Q especially given that we got some tough comps coming up in 4Q? And then on top of that, we normally see a pickup in margins in Life Sciences and one or 2 other businesses. Should we expect to have some of that normal seasonality coming through?
Daniel L. Comas: Maybe I'll just, on the Life Science, you -- we're going to have -- they're going to get their fair share of restructuring in the fourth quarter in Life Science Diagnostics. But despite that, you'll see a nice sequential improvement here from Q3 and maybe broadly on...
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I mean from a top line perspective, Nigel, again, I think we're going to see or would expect the fourth quarter to come in pretty much in line with what we've seen here in the third quarter. But that's despite a 300-basis point easier compare. So I think there were a number of places where September showed a little bit of a push at the end, but not enough for us to get excited. At least, I think on balance, that might have been pent up from July, August, some of that perhaps is just typical quarter-end stuff. But I think we've remained concerned about the U.S. and Europe, particularly with respect to capital or bigger ticket discretionary sorts of things and we could see some of that get pushed again.
Operator: We'll hear next from Julian Mitchell from Crédit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: The first question just really on pricing. So I guess, you called out that pricing was pretty good in Industrial, Tek and Environmental. I just wondered if the margins in Life Science and Test & Measurement, when you were talking about the sequential move down in Life Science and the heavy year-on-year decrementals in Test & Measurement, was there anything going on, on price? I mean, the volumes have obviously softened as you've gone through the year. Are you starting to see price get a little bit worse in any of the business segments?
Daniel L. Comas: I mean, Life Science price, Julian, was slightly negative in Q3. But I think that's pretty comparable to what we saw in the first half. Again, it really was more of the fact that you had your high BCM equipment business and Life Science being down organically really driving the margins. Probably a little bit of element to that in T&M, price probably a little bit more of an impact on margins. We were running probably about 0.5 point of price in the first half of the year and we didn't get any price in Test. It wasn't negative, but we didn't get any price in the third quarter. So that probably hurt us a little bit on the margin side in T&M.
Julian Mitchell - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the portfolio, I mean you've obviously announced the JV divestment will close early next year. When you look at the rest of the portfolio, I mean, are you sort of broadly happy with that? You feel that you've got out most of the areas now after the last 18 months and it's really just a question of how much M&A you do from here?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think that's broadly the case, Julian. I think as we look at the portfolio, while we would never say never, we would submit that over 90% of the revenues today are in our desirable growth platforms. So as we think about the next $1 billion, the next $5 billion of activity, it should be acquisitions more so than divestitures and again, hopefully, balanced across the 5 segments.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I know Beckman gets most of the limelight now from Tektronix, but could we maybe go back to Tek a little bit. I guess this is the fourth quarter of continuing worsening core growth. It was low -- down low single, down mid single, down high single and now down midteens. And maybe just dive into that a little bit and versus your expectations and the updates we've gotten over the year in terms of how you think that, well, past the integration now and how that business unit's kind of playing out from your perspective within the portfolio and whether this is just a cyclical issue.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, yes. I think that when we look at Tek, we wouldn't -- I think any business within Danaher has a healthy list of improvement opportunities and Tek is no different, Steve. But if we look at the second half performance here and the outlook Dan just referenced, I think what we've seen is, frankly, that the technology end markets that we serve and some of the key geographies, particularly China, have been soft. We -- I think we're of the view that they would be firming up a bit, that we'd begin to anniversary some of those down comps and that would be helpful. But between what we're seeing in Tek and what we're seeing in China, particularly, that's not the near-term outlook unfortunately. So again, I don't want to suggest to you that we are executing flawlessly there. But I think it's largely a macro call and we want to get to work on the things we can control and ride out the macro as best we can.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Is it living up to your return on capital expectations in terms of how that's -- or is that getting pushed out even further at this point?
Daniel L. Comas: I mean, in light of the top line this year, it's getting pushed out. I mean, we're -- I mean, our communication side of the business is way ahead, but the top line on the instruments side has pushed that out.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Right, okay. And -- but strategically, there are no sort of major changes to the direction of that business, right?
H. Lawrence Culp: No.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, all right. And then maybe contrast that with some of the strongest performing accelerating growth from Product ID and -- we're seeing it in Product ID, we're seeing it in ChemTreat, we're seeing it in Radiometer where it's something like between 11 and 16 quarters of straight growth. That's been pretty significant. And in acquisitive areas also over time, how are -- what is driving some of that consistently? Is it the product introduction side that you're frequently referencing or how should we think about that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think if you were to put those businesses on the table, Radiometer or even Leica Bio, you talked about ChemTreat, you talked about Product ID from BJ to Esko, you'd really break it down, Steve, I think, differently across the businesses with DBS being the common denominator. Better go-to-market execution in terms of what the marketers are setting up for the sales force and the way the sales force is executing in the field. New product innovation is very much an important part of what we're doing in those businesses, without question. But the third bit, which is still important, is what we do from a quality delivering cost perspective. Some folks think that, if you will, kind of shopfloor DBS is relevant, but whether we're going into the factory in Copenhagen at Radiometer or the service network at ChemTreat or even in the software routing labs at Esko, DBS has a lot of positive impact so that the rest of the business can really operate without a tremendous amount of friction. So we can kind of break down each one of those stories, but it's just, I think, day in, day out strong, balanced, continuous improvement in those 3 areas, which is driving the growth that you see. Certainly in Product ID, we get the secular benefit of broad exposure to supply chain, product security and more customized marketing trends, particularly in consumer goods. Clearly, at ChemTreat, we're benefiting from a fair bit of market disruption over time as well. In Diagnostics, particularly in critical care and in oncology, unfortunately, those are both growth sectors where Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, respectively, are exceptionally well positioned. So we get a -- we got to make a little bit of our own luck there, but we also think we face some broader secular trends there and elsewhere that are going to be good over the long haul.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. And just a final detail, the euro assumption that you have into the, I think, $0.01 in the fourth quarter from FX, could you just give us that your -- on your assumption?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes. I mean, it's just basically the $1.30 versus kind of the mid-$1.20s where it was over the summer.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Larry, did the second half of September, because I know that September is a very important month and often these quarters, there are swing factors in the final days of the quarter, did the second half of September or as the quarter played on or the month of September played on demonstrably weakened versus expectations in terms of the CapEx dynamic that you were talking about?
H. Lawrence Culp: I wouldn't say it was -- there was broad-based weakening that accelerated in the last week or 2, John, but we certainly saw some places where we saw some things push that we thought wouldn't in the last week or 2. But didn't try to tally it up to determine what that meant when the dust settled.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Were there any pockets of the portfolio that actually got a little bit better than expected?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think the consumables businesses or the consumable parts of a number of the businesses, again whether it's Product ID, even Diagnostics, were solid. I wouldn't say that we saw an uptick. There were some places where we saw POS pick up a bit. But I really wouldn't want to try to get into a lot of detail there, John, because I think it would be potentially misleading. I think we saw, by and large, that September uptick just wasn't enough and the tone out there, again in the U.S. and Europe, particularly, is x housing, x autos where we don't have a lot of exposure, it's just not that buoyant right now.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, that's fair. Can I ask you, you guys did a tremendous job of preserving profits in the last recession. This time around you're sort of in advance of a lot of companies in terms of restructuring and doing some more restructuring than previously called out. If the U.S. were to tip into, let's say, a mild recession, do you feel as confident that Danaher would be able to have as many cost levers to go after, if you will, to be able to preserve profitability the way you sort of did last time?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I certainly would say that we would have that intent, John. I think that when you think about the downturns as I think Dan was alluding to earlier, we're not in any way anticipating a post-Lehman, a post dot-com sort of downturn. If there's anything out there of that nature, we would expect it to be more muted. The operating challenge, of course, is to make sure that we're balancing what we do on the cost side with the protection of our organic investments, be they short term in terms of go-to-market or longer term around new product development. But that's always the case. I think what we've tried to do not only back in the summertime with the $100 million call out, now the 20% increase to that restructuring effort here this year is just to give ourselves more latitude in that regard as we think about earnings growth and long-term growth investments going into '13.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just lastly, Larry, given the deal you did in China and the downturn in China, is that shaking out more M&A opportunities for you there for whatever reason, maybe more willing sellers or just evolution of markets? How are you thinking about that?
H. Lawrence Culp: John, I think that's -- it's an interesting question. I think we're more optimistic today about our China M&A outlook than we've ever been. It's hard for me to pinpoint the root cause because the macro dynamics that you highlight, I think, are very much in play. I also think that our team's doing a better job. So it's really the combination, which I think fuel our optimism.
Operator: We have time for one final question, and we'll hear from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So I guess just one big picture question, Larry. You said you expected 4Q to be similar to 3Q in terms of core growth, but obviously, as you mentioned, your comps get much easier. So if you think about sequentially, maybe thinking about those big buckets that you talked about, consumables versus instruments, is it the instruments that you expect to maybe be a little bit worse sequentially in the fourth quarter, or just kind of how you're thinking big picture about the sequential dynamics of the business.
H. Lawrence Culp: Good morning, Jon. You nailed it. If we break down consumables versus equipment, we would look broadly and say we think consumables, again, despite the comps will be in that 4% range. But we would -- we'd expect equipment and primarily, again, around some of the businesses that we flagged to be down slightly.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then if I can, just 2 quick clarifications. One, it was kind of hit on, on the Tektronix business and I guess you don't really have much more insight in the next 3 months or so as to what will happen there, but on the Life Sciences side, I was just a little -- it looks like AB SCIEX in 2Q and 3Q was kind of low-single digits. So I just want to clarify kind of what happened there. Was it more the Leica business because I think they're similar sizes, was it more the Leica business that was down worse than expected or did you expect that AB to be -- to grow even better than it did in the quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: You're right again, Jon. It's principally the softness at Leica that is bringing down the overall number there. Sciex, as you can appreciate, probably has a little bit of pent-up business here with the timing of the launches come out of ASMS purely with the 6500. But on balance, it is a -- it's a Leica story.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then last one just quickly, how are you thinking about the medical device tax in '13 and maybe just either size it, I know it's under manufactured costs, so it's maybe not the full 2%, but I'm just -- and are you going to be able to offset that in any way? Just curious how you're thinking about it today.
H. Lawrence Culp: I was hoping to avoid any political questions here a few weeks before the election. But I think we're in the process of working through our options and the impact here, Jon, as we, I think, gear up from an operating perspective in the fourth quarter not only from -- with our '13 budgets, but frankly some of the more tactical considerations. Clearly, we need to be mindful as to what others do here but to the extent that we can pass some of this along, we will attempt to do that.
Daniel L. Comas: And Jon, I mean, we'll go through all the detail in our budgets here in November. But our kind of top-level look is if the full tax goes in and we're not able to recover any of it and that's not going to be our assumption, but just lay out the math, it'd probably be about a $0.01 a quarter hit. So $10-plus million a quarter hit.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. I know you'd talk about it more when you give guidance, but just people are already going to have '13 estimates, so just wanted to make sure we were clear.
Operator: That will conclude our questions-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt McGrew for closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Deana. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Deana and I will be around all day for follow-ups.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased by the sequential improvement in our core growth and our strong operating margin and cash flow performance in the quarter. Despite the macro headlines, we grew 3.5% organically in the quarter, and the team did an outstanding job on the execution front with an 80 basis points of year-over-year core operating margin expansion, a 31% year-over-year increase in free cash flow and a 31% growth in EPS. We continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share, driven by DBS, as well as our investments in innovation. Videojet, ChemTreat, Leica Biosystems, Esko, Kerr, Arbor Networks and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken market share during the quarter. Geographically, the U.S. largely continued its strong start to 2012, with our Q2 revenues growing mid-single digits, though we did see some pockets of weakness as we exited the quarter. In Western Europe, our sales were flat in the quarter, which, by and large, resonates with the headlines. China was mixed but flat in the quarter. The bright spot in China for us has been healthcare with both our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses growing double digits in the quarter. The rest of the emerging markets remained strong and also grew at a double-digit rate. We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. Through the first 6 months, we've deployed nearly $1 billion of capital on 8 acquisitions, primarily in our Industrial, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. Even taking into account the capital we deployed on these transactions, we still expect to have more than $5 billion of M&A capacity over the next 2 years. Turning to details of the quarter. Today, we reported record second quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.84, a 31% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. The current period includes a $0.03 benefit from a lower-than-anticipated income tax rate and a gain from resolving a contingency related to a prior asset disposal. Revenues for the quarter increased 25% to $4.6 billion, with core revenues up 3.5%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 25% while currency translation reduced sales by 3.5%. Our gross margin for the second quarter was 51.7%. Our reported operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1 billion, a 31.5% increase year-over-year. Free cash for the first half of 2012 was $1.5 billion, up 31%, and our free cash to net income conversion ratio for the first half was a robust 131%. Particularly in these uncertain economic times, DBS's impact on cash flow growth serves us very well. And finally, our tax rate in the second quarter was 22.5% as compared to 24.3% for the second quarter last year. The lower rate reflects the impact of a discrete tax benefit resulting from the expiration of a statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position, as well as the cumulative cash [ph] effect of a lower estimated tax rate for the full year, which, together, benefited EPS by $0.02 in the quarter. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of about 24% for the balance of the year. Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement segment revenues and core revenues increased 1% for the quarter. Core operating margin for the second quarter decreased 85 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 90 basis points to 21.5%. Our Instruments business' core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. At Fluke, core revenues were down slightly with growth in the U.S. distribution channel more than offset by weak demand in other geographies, particularly China. In the quarter, Fluke received 2 Gold Medal awards from Industrial Design Excellence for our new clamp meter family. During the quarter as well, we acquired U.K.-based IRIS to enhance our R&D capabilities in our core thermography lines. At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits in the quarter with continued softness in China and Europe, offset somewhat by strength in Latin America and in our service business. Core revenues from our communications businesses grew mid-teens in the quarter, with continued healthy demand from wireless carriers in both North America and Europe with Tektronix Communications' network management solutions. At Arbor Networks, we continue to see solid demand for our network security solutions, as DdoS and Internet security remains strategic concerns for our customers as they seek solutions to prevent and defend against cyber attacks. During the quarter, Fluke Networks launched the multi-fiber Pro-Tool for automatic testing of fiber cables and the TS PRO series for carrier field technician's voice data and video testing. While demand should remain solid in the second half of the year, core growth rates in our communications businesses are expected to moderate due to difficult prior-year comparisons. During the quarter, we acquired VSS Monitoring, a San Mateo, California-based provider of network monitoring switches and technology using next-generation ultrahigh-speed network probes. Network monitoring switches service to front end for monitoring and securing networks by selectively segregating and directing traffic, allowing telecom service providers and enterprise IT professionals to more effectively manage even the largest networks. In Environmental, revenues increased 4.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 6%. The segment core operating margin increased 55 basis points in the second quarter, with reported operating margin essentially flat due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water Quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by solid growth in North America. At Hach, demand continued to be healthy for our core lab and process instrumentation, position the company's initiatives to expand its service business to help drive double-digit year-to-date growth in that category. ChemTreat continues to execute extremely well, with the second quarter marking their eighth quarter in a row of double-digit core revenue growth. Their sustained outperformance can be attributed to their best-in-class go-to-market initiatives, as well as their commitment to innovation on behalf of their customers. They recently launched an environmentally friendly starch-based solution known as Green DTAC [ph] to help customers reduce sludge buildup in their systems, resulting in lower maintenance costs, higher uptime and reduced waste removal charges. As some of you may recall from our Investor Day last December, we highlighted Trojan's new UVSigna system, which makes conversion to ultraviolet disinfection easier for customers by reducing the footprint, simplifying maintenance and lowering the total cost of ownership. During the quarter, we shipped our first system to a U.S. municipality and continue to see robust order activity for this new product. Trojan is also continuing validation work on its Ballast Water Treatment solution, and during the quarter, shipped its first system. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, led by solid demand for dispensers, payment solutions and environmental monitoring systems. In particular, payment solution sales increased low double digits in the quarter, with strong sales of EMV security upgrades for credit and debit cards in North America. During the quarter, we acquired Catlow, a manufacturer of nozzles and other hanging hardware to enhance GVR's vapor recovery capabilities while also strengthening our alternative fuel dispensing solutions. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter increased 124.5%, largely due to the 2011 addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 5% and include one week of Beckman Coulter revenues, which were not material to the overall core growth rates in the quarter. Core operating margin for the segment was up 165 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 820 basis points from the prior year to 13.1%. Diagnostics continued their solid performance with high single-digit core growth in the quarter. The Radiometer core sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with broad-based growth in all major geographies led by the emerging markets. China grew in excess of 25%, with particularly robust uptake of our AQT system following regulatory approval late last year. Leica Biosystems increased at a low double-digit rate led by advanced staining, which was up more than 20%, while the core histology business rebounded at a high single-digit rate. All major geographies saw growth in the quarter, with particular strength in China, the emerging markets and North America. At Beckman Coulter, we've been exceptionally pleased with the first year progress, as DBS continues making an impact on many facets of the business, including quality, while setting the stage for future growth and improving the cost structure. Quality remains a critical priority for us at Beckman. We continue to focus on the quality system itself and on product quality. On that front, I'm pleased to report that we have received FDA premarket approval for the Class III Prostate Health Index assay, a simple noninvasive blood test. It's 2.5x more specific in detecting prostate cancer than PSA alone in patients. The accuracy of the test also benefits patients by reducing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. This was the third consecutive quarter of low single-digits Diagnostics revenue growth. We also continue to be encouraged by our retention and win rates, as well as the success we've seen with new product launches, including the AU 5800 series and the phi assay. We've made tremendous progress on the cost side over the last year, and since the acquisition, our operating margin has increased more than 400 basis points. This week we attended the American Association of Clinical Chemistry meeting in California, where the overall tone was outstanding. A number of customers commented to the team about improvements they've seen over the past year, particularly with respect to lower unplanned service visits and other key metrics with respect to service quality. While there's still a lot of work ahead, we're happy with what the team has accomplished in their first year with Danaher, and my thanks go out to everyone at Beckman who has contributed to the success. In Life Sciences, we saw low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. AB SCIEX's core sales grew modestly in the quarter against what was their highest growth quarter in the prior year. We continue to see strong growth in China and the emerging markets, offset by weakness in the U.S. and Japan. For those of you that joined us last month in Toronto at our Investor Day, you saw firsthand DBS's impact on new product development at AB SCIEX. At ASMS in June, they debuted the new 6500 series, the world's most sensitive triple quad system designed for complex analysis, including drug discovery and development in regulated labs, peptide quantitation and biomarker verification. They also enhanced the TripleTOF, family introducing the 5600 series for routine analysis and the 5600+ for more complex analysis. Customer feedback on all new products has been exceptional. In particular, the 6500 has been particularly well received, with significant orders booked in the second quarter, even though the product doesn't begin shipping until here in the third quarter. Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with strength in China and the emerging markets across most product categories. Late in the second quarter, we launched the SP8 confocal microscope, a truly innovative solution developed using extensive VOC from Life Science researchers. The SP8 allows a researcher to start with an entry-level confocal and to move up in a modular way to increase the functionality of the system as the research process requires and as funding becomes available. Here, too, initial customer feedback has been excellent. In Dental, core revenues increased 5% in the first quarter. We have outstanding traction in the margin front, with core operating margins up 325 basis points and reported operating margin increasing 350 basis points to 14.4%. We are extremely pleased with our first half Dental performance. Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by sales for our general dentistry consumables, infection-prevention products and orthodontic solutions across all major geographies. Damon Clear, our aesthetic self-ligating orthodontic brackets, grew double digits in the quarter. Dental equipment core revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. We saw strength in imaging, up double digits, with healthy demand for our intraoral sensors, along with a solid uptake of our combo 2D/3D imaging product, which has now been rolled out globally across all of our major brands. During the quarter, we also launched the Helios 1800 LED energy-efficient light, which builds off an existing platform with an entry-level solution in the key LED category. In Industrial Technologies, total revenues were up 0.5%, while core revenues were up 1% for the quarter. Our core operating margin increased 105 basis points in the second quarter, with our reported operating margin up 60 basis points to 22.4%. Product Identification core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter with growth across most major geographies, including the U.S., China and Latin America. Sales of our CIJ printers were particularly healthy, growing mid-teens globally. During the quarter, we launched the Willett 630 CIJ printer designed in China for the Chinese market. Customer enthusiasm has been high there, with orders for over 500 units in the first couple of months. During the quarter, we closed our previously announced acquisition of X-Rite. While still in the early days, we're off to a great start with the team embracing DBS and exploring opportunities to lever our global network of PID brands. Last month, both X-Rite and Esko exhibited at drupa, the world's largest printing and packaging trade show. Esko introduced new hardware at the show, as well as its next-generation software suite for design and preproduction. Esko Suite 12 is packed with new functionality, including richer 3D capabilities and better workflow automation, to help print and packaging customers drive efficiency. Customer response to Esko's new products was extremely favorable, helping to drive mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter. In Motion, core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, with softness in industrial automation, technology and renewable energy markets across most major geographies. We expect the rate of year-over-year core sales decline to improve as we move forward for the balance of the year, in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons. So to wrap up, we are quite pleased with our growth, earnings and cash flow performance. While the team continues to execute well, the uncertain macro environment suggests to us that it's prudent to accelerate cost actions, which will help us protect and maintain our growth investments. We now anticipate spending approximately $100 million this year on restructuring activities, about double our previous plan. We believe our focus on capturing market share while taking these actions, coupled with our optimism and capacity on the acquisition front, positions as well for the balance of 2012 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.74 to $0.79. We are also updating our full year diluted net EPS guidance from $3.25 to $3.35 to $3.19 to $3.26. The midpoint of our revised EPS guidance would result in approximately 14% year-over-year EPS growth compared to last year, adjusted EPS of $2.83. The reduction in the full year guidance is primarily attributable to the accelerated restructuring activities and the anticipated negative currency impact from the recent strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by the $0.03 benefit in the second quarter. We are assuming second half core revenue growth will be in line with what we achieved in the first half of this year.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal conference. We are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Could you maybe give us some better or some additional clarity? I guess, one, on how were the demand pattern shifting through the quarter itself? Did you see continued acceleration or deceleration into -- through June? And then secondly, when you think about the second half core growth in line with the first half, maybe give us some more color by business about how you're seeing it and what you're seeing either in inventory or other indicators that are leading you to the conservatism other than sort of just macro indicators.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I would say -- Steve, maybe a couple of thoughts here. I think with respect to the first part of your question, what we saw, say, by business in the quarter, I think we saw 3 to 5 businesses fundamentally in line with what we thought we would see during the quarter, with Life Sciences & Diagnostics up slightly and Industrial Tech slightly below. I think, again, as we saw the quarter play out, I think we were very encouraged with the strength of the overall quarter as we look around the business. But certainly, during the quarter, I think we saw some things that give us some pause and obviously have us thinking about the environment here with the acceleration of the cost actions. I think as we think about the second half, certainly, we saw in June, I think, some signs that the second half may play out a little bit differently than we had anticipated originally. Certainly, the China rebound, I think we were anticipating as others were, is going to come; it's probably just not going to come in the time frame that we had anticipated here in the second half. Certainly, Motion and T&M are not rebounding in the way that we had anticipated or had hoped. Now there's an obvious intersection there between Motion and T&M and the China softness. Clearly, there's -- I think there's more uncertainty today in and around some of the life science funding dynamics. And even in the U.S., where we've had another, I think, exceptionally strong quarter, we saw some, if you will, hairline fractures in certain businesses that just have us on alert. I think that, coupled with the headlines, which there are very view positive macro headlines out there globally right now, I think give us the impetus here from a topside perspective to say, hey, the risks are to the downside. Let's take note of the fact we're having a very good year from an earnings, from a cash perspective. But let's proactively, even though the businesses probably have a slightly more optimistic outlook for the second half, go ahead and set the stage to take advantage of the year that we're having to take the cost actions in order to protect our growth environments if the environment does continue to slide here a bit. I think with respect to the quarter, the third quarter here, and the current view, Steve, is that we'll be fundamentally in line with what we saw in the first half, so call that 2.5, 3. And as you think about the fourth, probably more in line here with what we just printed, call it 3, 3.5 on the core side.
Daniel L. Comas: And if you looked at it by -- Steve, maybe by segment, just quickly, we'd be looking at 4 of the 5 segments being up low single to mid-single with the exception being T&M, where we would expect that to be down. It's not that the instrument business is getting worse, but, as we alluded, that the communications business is not going to sustain its double-digit growth it's had here in the first half, in part because of the comp issues. So we could see T&M down kind of low single digit to mid-single digit here in the third quarter. And as kind of Larry alluded to are the numbers from our businesses would be higher than that. So most -- some of our segments, where we're telling you we think it's low single to mid-single in some of our businesses, with their numbers, they were all up to more of a mid-single-digit point of view. So I think we're taking, again, a little bit of a top level perspective and adjustment here, given the macro environment, given the few things we've seen here of late.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. So it sounds like there's contingency built into that is what you're saying, right, in terms of roll up versus the top down view?
Daniel L. Comas: That is -- that's the right way to look at it, yes.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And just lastly, the T&M margin pressure, is that mostly operating leverage?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes. As you know, as we've talked about, T&M is our highest gross margin segment, and obviously, that's hurting us here. And we will see that impact again here in the third quarter, and you'll see a step-down sequentially in our margins Q2 to Q3 in T&M.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you just give us a little bit of an update on the -- in integration and maybe how the instrument placements are going from a top line perspective?
H. Lawrence Culp: I assume you're talking about Beckman, Steve?
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. Beckman, yes.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I'm sorry. A year in here, I think we're very pleased with where we are as we highlighted in some of the prepared remarks. Now certainly, the primary objective there has been quality. I think we've made a lot of progress. You just see that in the reinspections and the new product approvals and just a lot of the internal metrics that we look at on a weekly basis. With respect to growth, and clearly, we're encouraged here with the low single-digit growth in Diagnostics that we're going to print or allude to here, it's not yet part of the core for 3 quarters in a row, I think that speaks to this business really getting back up on its feet, no silver bullet there, Steve, but just a lot of different actions being taken to improve service levels, certainly the quality improvements help. And I think that, coupled with the new product introductions, the investments that we're making in our sales and marketing organizations, has us encouraged that this is a business that, once fully up on its feet, will be a real contributor to Danaher's overall core growth.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then just within the businesses, I mean, you mentioned some, I guess, you used the term hairline fractures, I mean. And anything more specific than that you're seeing in your short cycle businesses? And then how have things kind of started off here in July?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, Steve, I would say that July is very much in line with what we were anticipating here, so we're encouraged by that. A little hard to read, at least the U.S., given the 4th of July holiday falling in the middle of the week. But with respect to what we were talking about in the second quarter, in the U.S., I think we saw some signs in and around Life Sciences, certainly, in T&M and, to a lesser degree, in Environmental, where even businesses like -- even some of the businesses that we're printing very good numbers here just had a little bit of softness, a little bit of, say, a forecast miss here or there where we were seeing customers hesitate to write POs, in other cases projects being pushed out a little more than we would have anticipated. I think if we weren't so mindful of the headlines and the drumbeat of negative news, it might be easier to say, hey, well, that -- those are just -- that's just noise. But again, I think we're going to exercise a level of prudence here and to say, hey, the risks probably are to the downside. Let's go ahead and take some proactive actions here that are the right things for the business so that we continue to make the longer-term investments for the corporation.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then one last question. Is there anything in the portfolio rationalization side where you guys are still -- you're opportunistic in selling things? Is there anything that's out there that you're looking at that could either fund further acquisition on the balance sheet, but also maybe just a timing issue where you could, ultimately, offset this restructuring cost in the ForEx headwind with gains in the back half? I know you don't play that game, but I'm not sure if there's anything you're looking at left in the portfolio that's kind of noncore.
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I think, well, obviously, we've done a fair amount of pruning the last couple years. And given our joint venture with Cooper, soon to be heating [ph] with the tools -- on the tools front, a business that had a very good second quarter and, in fact, sequentially. So as revenues rise $25 million and with terrific fall-through hits, $25 million sequential increase in revenues and a $10 million increase in OP sequentially, Q1 to Q2, I mean, that's something that obviously down the road, under the right situation, could be something that could be used for acquisition proceeds.
Operator: We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So, Dan, if you could maybe -- or, Larry, if you just talk about the CAGR [ph] cadence. You've given some good detail already. But it looks like 2% to 3% for the second half of the year is your planned assumption, but your comps go much easier in 4Q. So I'm wondering how does 3Q look in your plan relative to the 4Q. And if you could maybe just then pass into that, the impact of Beckman Coulter rolling to the numbers in the second half of the year.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. Nigel, to be clear, I think that what we're going to see here in the third is a slight downtick from where we were in the second. So call that 2.5, 3, given what we know today. I think we would see near the fourth quarter step up from that, call it to 3, 3.5. But you're kind of in a band where the first half is going to be in line with the second half. Beckman does kick in. It kicked in for a week, but that was just -- it's not meaningful in the second quarter. It kicks in here obviously -- here forward and has an ever so slight dilutive effect. But at this point, given the performance that we're seeing there, it's not much to call out. So I think what we're looking at -- again, I think in light of what we're seeing or not seeing in China, certainly, the softness at T&M, in particular in China and elsewhere, and just some concerns about the way the macro environment plays out in the second half has us putting that outlook together, but one in which we think we can drive good market share gains in.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then -- I mean, it doesn't sound like there's much changing just from your comments, but you talked about some hairline fractures. But the quarter, you're flat in Europe. You're flat in China. I mean, is the decision to restructure, is it driven more by what you see in the macro side, or is that a bit more within the businesses, maybe some of the book-to-bill ratios in June that caused you to launch this program?
H. Lawrence Culp: Nigel, it's a judgment call. So admittedly, it's hard to describe for you how much of it is a view of what we're seeing internally, how much of it is a function of what we see out the window here. But I think all -- and even though the comps do get easier, China is going to take a while to rebound. I think the political dynamics there are probably more pronounced than we had perhaps anticipated. That said, they're clearly engaging. Europe is what it is, and the U.S. has been quite strong for us. But I think we want to make sure that come what may, around the world, we're still in a position to make the growth investments in the second half of this year, the first half of next year, admits that uncertainty so that we're driving the company forward over the long haul. That's the way we've always managed. We'd like to think this is a prudent approach, some may call it conservative. That's fine to our ears. I think at the end of the day, that if things are better, we'll obviously print better numbers. But given what we know today and don't, I think this is the right thing to do.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just on the 3Q guidance, does the bulk of the $0.06 delta on restructuring come within 3Q?
Daniel L. Comas: No, it's more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. What you're seeing in the third quarter is primarily an FX dynamic. The euro kind of peaked this time last year. The year-on-year, we have about a $0.05 headwind. And then actually, even sequentially, we have about a $0.02 headwind between Q2 and Q3, given the dollar really didn't begin to strengthen significantly until June. That, coupled with -- of the expectation, slightly lower growth sequentially and some restructuring, frames up the guide here for Q3.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Wood with Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So, Larry, can you just tighten up perhaps the view on Life Sciences & Diagnostics for the year? You initially offered 3% to 7%. Is it possible to get a bit better view on how that business shakes out for all of 2012 at this point?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think that what we're clearly seeing there, Jon, is the softening in the spending drivers, particularly with respect to some of the government-funded dynamics. I think, particularly, as we look at some of our big ticket products, the new products, which is SCIEX and Leica, I think we're encouraged by those product launches, probably hurt us a little bit, both with the new mass specs out of SCIEX and Leica with the new confocal, given the timing. I know we hung some customers up here in the second quarter as they were evaluating and, in turn, placing orders on the new products, shipments obviously to come. But I don't think the new product launches are going to be pronounced enough for us not to see some softening in the core in Life Sciences. So I still think Life Sciences & Diagnostics, as a whole, probably will be one of our leading segments from a growth perspective. But Diagnostics will clearly be the better performing business of the 2 as we look at the second half.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right, great. That's good color. And I mean, thanks for the update on Beckman. Just if you look to the back half and obviously with the troponin submissions already in the FDA, assuming that goes according to plan, I mean, is it at the point where we can kind of rule out the flat number for Beckman diagnostics? And would you expect that business to accelerate in 2013 just given what you know today?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, certainly, I think we've got a lot of the things within our control getting better every day, and that's obviously helpful. There's still some factors where we're working with others to improve our ability to grow. But I think at this point, Jon, as we look at next year, I think low singles is probably what makes sense with respect to expectations, with mid-singles being certainly within reach for 2014.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you talk about some of the deals you did this quarter? And you did 8, but really, all we really know about is X-Rite, and it seems like a pretty active deal book. Just in context and maybe what type of multiples you're seeing, are they deals that are easy bolt-ons or generally accretive or dilutive? I mean, just a little bit of color around that.
H. Lawrence Culp: I think that by and large, Scott, we would characterize the other deals here, absent X-Rite, as really bolt-ons, where we're bringing on capability, bringing on distribution resources that bolt on in a clear, close, strategic way to existing businesses. I mentioned a couple in the prepared remarks. Certainly, within TEK Comms, where we've seen tremendous growth, VSS gives us tremendous capacity to continue the monitoring capability that TEK Comms does for the wireless carriers. These network switches are really part of a technology term where we think VSS is very well positioned. So they'll be working hand in hand with the TEK Comms business to make sure that, around the world, we're taking their capability and putting it forward in front of customers in the best possible way. And we mentioned Catlow down at GVR as well, a company we've known for a long time. But as we expand our vapor recovery offering, certainly, having that hanging hardware capability that they have is an important addition, but again, kind of a classic Danaher bolt-on acquisition in that regard.
Daniel L. Comas: And in terms -- I mean, in terms of the multiple, I think the one that's most relative, just given the size, would be X-Rite. It's more kind of an adjacency-type acquisition, and we paid about 10x trailing EBITDA there. Given the cost takeout, some of the public company costs that come out very quickly, we can scale that down very quickly.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Just to get back to some of your macro view. I mean, if you take some of your bellwether businesses, and I always think about Fluke, for example, and a couple of the industrial TEK businesses, but Fluke I know has scale in China, I mean, what do you see in emerging markets as it relates to their shorter cycle businesses? And any bottoming that's going on there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think, by and large, Scott, that's a good -- certainly, Fluke's a good barometer for us in that regard. The fact we've got 40% of our business on consumables also gives us kind of a really good pulse in addition to some of the other POS data that we have. We really can't, at this point, separate China from the rest of the emerging market basket. I think what we've seen in China has really been, I think, evidence of the slowdown there outside of healthcare. I'm encouraged by that, because while we don't like the fact that we've certainly seen our non-healthcare businesses basically be flattish with flat to slightly down, with T&M being down double digit, the healthcare businesses, I think because of the government's actions purely with its rural healthcare initiatives, have been quite strong, in addition to what they're trying to do to establish an indigenous of life science research capability. But it is what it is, and I don't think that underlying business that we see in Industrial and in Environmental, let alone in T&M, gets materially better until late this year or early next year. But if I go to the other side of the so-called BRICS plus, even though some of the headlines out of India and Brazil have not been, I think, particularly encouraging. By and large, we're seeing a good consistent, steady growth. In many of those markets, we have modest positions. Though the base that we're growing off of is not that pronounced, that's a good thing for us. We're clearly getting our bearings and really understanding how to play and compete in those parts of the world. But there's really no place else in the world right now, Scott, that we would say we're seeing the sort of broad softening x healthcare that we're seeing in China.
Operator: We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So in terms of margins maybe a little bit, I mean, you've obviously taken a more conservative view on organic. I mean, are there areas that are tracking ahead of plan on margins? I mean, Dental, certainly, it looked like a strong spot. I don't know if you've had a breakthrough there, maybe highlight that or some other areas where you think margins are tracking ahead of plan.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I mean, certainly, Shannon, speaking to Dental, I think we're very pleased with that. Really, the first half performance all the way around, given the environment, could not have been better. I wouldn't say it's a breakthrough though, because we've got 3 years, this looks like it's going to be the fourth year in a row, where we had very steady margin improvement in Dental. And I think they know, even though they print, what, 14.4% here in the quarter, that there's plenty of upside still as we adjust the cost structure and get quality growth out of that business. So again, I think a lot of us remember some of the false starts that we had there way back when, but that now is really something for the history books. And the trend they're on, here again in the first half of this year, I think is indicative of what that business and that team is capable of delivering.
Daniel L. Comas: I think the other segment that we've been particularly pleased would be in the Industrial segment, where on modest growth, overall -- good growth at PID, but negative impact from the Motion-related businesses. We've been able to sustain that 20% segment operating margins, see core operating margin improvement in this quarter to about 100 basis points. Again, that's somewhat of a function of what we did in the fourth quarter of last year, another reason why we're teeing up some restructuring here, but we're also getting somewhat of a favorable price cost dynamic in Industrial Technology as well. We've got about 1.5 point of price in that segment. And given some of the commodity and some of the brief in declines in commodity prices, it doesn't benefit us a lot across the other segments, but it does definitely benefit us there.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, that helps. And then on free cash flow, I mean, in the quarter, I mean, the conversion was particularly strong, I mean, the whole first half but particularly in the quarter. I mean, was there anything unusual there? Or how would you characterize that in terms of sustainability?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, we printed a little bit, over $1.4 billion in the first half. I think we're positioned to kind of print a comparable number to that here in the second half. That would be a probably $400 million year-on-year increase in free cash flow. That continues to track very well. We did get a slight benefit versus last year. We had higher tax payments in the first half, lower in the second half. That'll be a little bit different this year. They were low in the first half. We'll be a little bit higher in the second half. But that's a small factor though. Overall, our working capital performance continues to be very strong. And we've got $350 million of amortization flowing through as well, and that continues to support that very high conversion ratio.
H. Lawrence Culp: Which, in turn, Shannon, of course, is why we are optimistic and, I think, ready to go here on the M&A front, right. We talked about what we have to spend here. You think about the $5 billion of firepower over the next couple of years. If the environment does become a bit more uncertain, as we are thoroughly suggesting that it could, that just can't help but make the M&A environment more attractive to us. We're ready to go.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Crédit Suisse.
Charles Clarke: It's actually Charlie Clarke for Julian. Just had a real quick question on the restructuring. Just if you guys could kind of break down kind of where you think that's going, just kind from an operating segment standpoint.
H. Lawrence Culp: Charlie, the $100 million in aggregate that we're flagging this morning will be well distributed across segments and geographies. I think as you may know, when we've talked about these actions at this stage probably in the past, we've tried to not getting into too much detail. I think that we prefer to have the opportunity to talk to affected associates before we talk about any specifics publicly, and we'll do that again here this year. But suffice it to say, obviously, the bulk of our developed market's footprint is where a lot of the structural cost in the corporation resides. We will be working hard in that regard. And some of the businesses that have lower relative margins today are probably the ones where there's a bit more upside and potential to improve our structural cost position in order to, again, preserve and protect those growth investments in the second half of this year and next year, which we think are really the long-term fuel for the organization.
Charles Clarke: Okay, great. And then just real quick. SG&A-to-sales ratio just seemed like it ticked up a bit kind of quarter-over-quarter just enough. Do you have any color on that?
Daniel L. Comas: Sorry, I'd have to look at it. Nothing jumps to me off-line right here, but I can -- I'll take a look at it.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So can you, Larry, on Tektronix around -- maybe on the instrument side of Test & Measurement. I think the last quarter, you highlighted that the department returned to a book-to-bill of over 1. Can you maybe just talk about what happened there intra-quarter? And then maybe kind of the follow-up on the restructuring. I know that's where you did a lot of restructuring back during the last downturn. Is that a business where there is more that you can still do, or not so much in that business?
H. Lawrence Culp: Let me take them in reverse order. There's always more you can do. I think that's rooted in the DBS mindset. We have done a lot, as Dan was mentioning earlier. Having done a lot over time is one reason we have such high margins at T&M and why we're going to feel that effect of the revenue softness in the second half. I think we prefer again not to get too specific here in mid-July. We'll keep you posted as we talk to associates through the second half. But suffice it to say, again, we'll be looking at everything as we get ready for the final implementation of this plan. With respect to what we saw through the quarter, the book-to-bill, again, at TEK was positive in -- I mean, positive in terms of being north of 1.0. But I think what we've seen is, again, that intersection between pronounced softness in China, particularly Europe to a lesser degree, and just a hesitancy, perhaps a much more subdued investment level on the part of customers, at least temporarily here, that have us, I think, looking at the second half, again, in line with what we saw in the first half, where T&M is not going to be the growth leader for us, particularly on the instrument side, that we have seen in years past.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: And just to clarify, in the second half, given the macro indicators that we see, you expect, on the instrument side, similar to the first half. That's what you said. And you said communications, that the comps would be slightly -- would make the overall numbers slightly lower, right?
Daniel L. Comas: And that'll be more pronounced in Q3. We then think we'll see some sequential improvement in Q4.
H. Lawrence Culp: Talking instruments.
Daniel L. Comas: Talking instruments, yes, right.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then if, again -- I mean, is that here at AACC [ph] as you alluded to? And it's clear unlike the Life -- on the Diagnostic and on the Life Science side, that all your customers are going to be under much more pressure from either a reimbursement standpoint or a funding standpoint. So now that you've owned those businesses for a while and you're kind of moving into this period, I'm just curious, did your strategy change at all? Or how are you just thinking about those businesses, given the constraints that a lot of your customers are going to be under?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that those constraints are not dissimilar from the realities that we anticipated when we've made these relative investments over time, and particularly so with Beckman last year. But I just continue to think that on the Diagnostic side, Jon, what we do from a scientific perspective is provide information at the front end of care, which can't help but be part of the solution long term to some of these macro pressures that all payers, government or otherwise are going to see. I think on the Life Science side, what we are, I think, well positioned to do is really skate to where the puck is, if you will, and not necessarily be tethered in a broad-based way to overall spending of what we do at AB SCIEX in mass spec, what we do at Leica with confocals. Very much it's targeted to the higher growth, the higher interest, the higher impact areas and categories where research work is being done. I think if we can continue do to that strategically, we'll be mindful of the macro pressures and any posterior budget effects that fall through our customers. I think we'll be well positioned to take, if you will, our unfair share of those overall budgets because of the value we'll be providing our customers.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: But just -- and I recognize you do not want to give specifics in terms of where you're going to do your restructuring, but in that environment, is there a need maybe as you've look at it to be more cost effective than maybe you initially thought? Or is that -- is it in line -- is everything you're seeing so far, even with some of the cracks that you mentioned in the U.S., is everything in line with your expectations, so it's more about trying to find the value you just alluded to on the revenue side?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics here again in the quarter, they were our star, right. I think we're flagging that the Life Science environment, at least, in the short term, probably gets a bit more challenging for us. But that said, I think anything that we might do in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Jon, is really a function of the opportunities that we see to improve the overall cost structure, much as we have at Beckman, 400 basis points up over the last year, much as we've done at AB SCIEX over the last 2 years, where I think we've been able to improve the cost structure while improving the overall operation of the business and, clearly, increasing the investment envelope up there for new technology and being a more serious player from a sales and service view, globally. So I think what we're suggesting here this morning is really borne of a global macro view and a desire to have more control over our destiny in a more uncertain world and not really a direct or indirect tieback to some of the long-term pressures that you're alluding to. And again I think there are long-term opportunities embedded there as well, which we're strategically very keen to go take advantage of.
Operator: We'll go next to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I had a couple quick follow-ups. First, on assumed conversion margins in the second half, a lot of sort of moving pieces in the overall margin picture, but the core conversion assumption is still around 30%, 35%?
Daniel L. Comas: Sure. Terry, we were about 35% in Q2 when you factor out the acquisitions and the FX impact. We should be in that zone here. And again, the one segment we will be challenged here will be T&M as we expect that segment to be down, tipping the third quarter. I think there will be less of a comp [ph] in the fourth quarter to where we expect to be down low single to mid-single digits in terms of growth and expect segment margins to be down a couple of hundred basis points sequentially. But outside that, the other 4 segments should be in that 35% zone.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe I missed it in the detail, but did you or could you give either the Beckman core on a stand-alone basis in 2Q or what Life Science's core, including Beckman, would have been?
Daniel L. Comas: Life Science -- Beckman all up was up low single digits in the quarter.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Larry, you've been very clear on cap allocation in the near term and the focus is on the M&A pipeline, but I just wondered, given sort of the shift in the world, if you will, number one. Number two, looking at your relative valuation versus the peer set versus where it's been historically, I wonder if there's a point at which stock buyback starts to become an option that you entertain more seriously. And if not, under what scenario could you see that occurring?
H. Lawrence Culp: Terry, I'd say this, from time-to-time, as you well know, we've been opportunistic in buying back shares. But I think our bias today is consistent with our long-term bias, and that is to redeploy our free cash by way of M&A. But obviously, it's something that we and the board constantly evaluate. But our long-term bias, I think, is very much intact as we look forward.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe I just wonder if there's any additional color on the pipeline from the standpoint of size. I mean, I think it's been pretty clear that we ought to be anticipating bolt-ons versus anything large, but I wonder if something may have changed there. And then secondly, I think the indication had been previously that maybe you are seeing more things outside of the Life Sciences area, and is that unchanged -- has that changed at all?
Daniel L. Comas: Terry, that's largely been -- things have been largely up by the Life Science-Diagnostics space over the last 2 to 3 quarters. I think we expect that to continue, though I -- we will probably -- now that we're a year post-Beckman, we'll start to be looking at bolt-ons for that space as well. Given where we are from a capital structure, we paid down -- our net debt down almost $2.5 billion over the last 12 months. I think we're geared back up beyond just looking at bolt-ons. And whether it's adjacency-type deals like X-Rite or even larger deals, I think those are all being considered right now. And given the macro environment, obviously, that creates some uncertainty in the marketplace and on Wall Street, that tends to be good for people like us. And we're optimistic we're going to be able to put the money to work here.
Operator: We'll take our last question today from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just going back quickly on the restructuring. I might have missed this. But could you address what the assumed paybacks are, the timing on these -- the incremental restructuring initiatives here?
Daniel L. Comas: Deane, we would expect to complete this $100 million of restructuring by the end of the year and would expect a slightly north of a 1-year payback that'll -- in the ballpark of a $75 million benefit next year.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So that would be $75 million on a run-rate basis for the -- for 2013, is that right?
Daniel L. Comas: Correct.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then I know you don't typically call out book to bill. It got called out in the first quarter because of the timing of some of the orders and later shipments. But how did that resolve for this quarter? How did book to bill end up for the second quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: It was right -- it was slightly north of 1, but basically 1.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then last question. Larry, you alluded to some growth investments. Oftentimes, when you see companies there facing a little bit uncertain macro, there's a pullback in growth investments. Can you just talk about what areas, the magnitude and would there be a sense of throttling back, or are these committed resources?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think the throttling back, Deane, is exactly what we're trying to avoid. I think if we were not taking the actions here in the second half, given the macro uncertainties, we might be dialing back some things in the margin, which, frankly, are sometimes the easiest things to pull back on when things are getting tighter or more uncertain, but by the same token, the very things that you ought to protect in tough times. So I think what we want to do is make sure we are taking out the structural costs that we can in a good year here to make sure that come what may, the go-to-market investments that we're making, be that in emerging markets, be that with respect to digital marketing, let alone the science and technology bets that we're making in new product development, are protected and, in some cases, increased.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to Mr. McGrew for closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, everybody. Dan and I are around all day for a follow-up.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great afternoon.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter progressed largely as anticipated against the highest core growth quarter of last year. Sales from the developed markets grew slightly, with the U.S. again noticeably better than Europe, which declined this quarter. China revenues were essentially flat while the rest of the emerging markets grew at a high single-digits rate.  Overall, we were encouraged by a number of factors. Both shipment and orders improved sequentially through the quarter. Organic order growth was about 2 points higher than revenue growth as we built backlog across many of our businesses. This was most noticeable in China, where our book to bill exceeded 1.1.  Also, in a number of markets, sellout by our distribution partners was stronger than our sell-in. We were pleased with the team's execution in the quarter, which led to 85 basis points of year-over-year core operating margin expansion, a 37.5% year-over-year increase in free cash flow and a 19.5% increase in EPS.  We continue to aggressively invest in new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives. During the quarter, we launched a number of exciting products, a few of which we will highlight through the call today.  We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. As you saw last week, we announced the pending acquisition of X-Rite, a global leader in color measurement. Even after closing X-Rite and 3 other deals in the quarter, we expect to have approximately $5 billion of M&A capacity over the next 2 years.  So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported record first quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.73, a 19.5% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 31% to $4.3 billion, with core revenues up 1.5%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 30.5%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point.  Our gross margin for the first quarter was 51.8%, a 250-basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our operating margin in the first quarter decreased 80 basis points year-over-year to 17%. DBS continues to be a primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. First quarter operating cash flow was $651 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow was $534 million, an increase of 37.5% versus the prior year. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 100%, inclusive of more than $50 million of incremental year-on-year cash spending related to our fourth quarter 2011 restructuring program. And finally, our tax rate in the first quarter was 25.3%, which was modestly higher than we had forecast. We expect the rates to be closer to 24% for the balance of the year.  So now let me turn to the 5 operating segments. To start with Test & Measurement, revenues there -- core revenues increased 2% for the quarter. Core operating margin for the first quarter increased 195 basis points while reported operating margin increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Overall, our instruments businesses' core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter.  Fluke core revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as growth in the U.S. of our service and installation tools was more than offset by weak demand in Europe and China. During the quarter, we launched the new Ti100 thermal imager platform, designed for industrial and building inspection applications. These imagers feature easy-to-use innovative on-camera tools and plug-and-play connectivity with Fluke's smart new software to collect, edit and analyze thermal images. Initial orders have been quite strong. Tektronix core sales declined mid-single digits in the quarter with continued softness in Europe and China. In the U.S., we continue to see solid POS, though our sell-in to distribution partners declined year-over-year. We were also encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in order activity across the business, with book to bill finishing at 1.0 for the quarter, an acceleration from the mid-90s rate last quarter.  The recent launch of TEK's 70000D Series 33-gigahertz oscilloscope is off to a great start, and our MDO4000 mixed domain oscilloscope continues to gain broad industry recognition as a game-changing technology. In the quarter, the MDO4000 received the prestigious ACE Award and the ultimate product in Test & Measurement systems category, the ninth major award recognizing the innovation at the foundation of the MDO4000. Core revenues from our communications businesses grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, led by healthy demand for Tektronix Communications' network management solutions for wireless carriers in North America, as well as our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Customers' response to Fluke Networks recently launched OptiView XG and Arbor Networks' Pravail network security system continues to be strong.  Moving to Environmental. Revenues increased 4% in the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. The segment core operating margin declined modestly in the first quarter, with reported operating margin decreasing 70 basis points to 18.6%.  Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate while orders were up mid single digits, due in part to solid demand across most industrial verticals. Municipal spending was stronger than anticipated in the U.S. but remains constrained in China, but project funnels are encouraging there.  Trojan is continuing validation work on its ballast water treatment solution and remains on track to begin shipping systems in earnest later this year. During the quarter, the U.S. Coast Guard issued their highly anticipated Ballast Water Discharge Standard, an important signal to the global community that the U.S. supports international regulation. ChemTreat continues to outperform based on the strength of their sales footprint and technical capabilities. During the quarter, they had several significant wins including a major U.S.-based manufacturer with over 20 sites. The first quarter marked ChemTreat's seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth, an outstanding achievement.  Gilbarco's -- Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low single digits, led by demand for our dispensers, vapor recovery solutions and automatic tank gauges. Our 2010 acquisition of the L&T dispenser business in India has allowed us to significantly expand our localization initiatives in that region. Recently, Gilbarco launched a new dispenser platform designed and manufactured in India. Customer reception has been extremely favorable, helping drive greater than 20% growth in our dispenser business in the quarter. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 146.5%, largely due to the addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 2% in the quarter. Core operating margin for the segment was up 25 basis points in the first quarter while our reported operating margin decreased 110 basis points from the prior year to 13.3%, largely as result of the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The Diagnostics businesses got off to a solid start to the year with mid single-digit core growth which, as a reminder, does not include Beckman Coulter.  Radiometer's core sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with broad-based strength across most product categories and geographies. Demand for our ABL80 blood gas analyzer in China was particularly robust, growing more than 20% in the quarter.  Following last years' regulatory approval, customer adoption of AQT in China has been strong, driven in part by the outstanding value proposition presented for our customers. A large Class 3 hospital in China recently purchased an AQT and informed us that they experienced a 66% improvement in turnaround time for cardiac marker results, which allows the hospitals to perform 2.5x the number of cardiac tests versus their central lab. We're obviously thrilled when we hear that sort of customer feedback from core customers. Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate, with mid-teens in shipments and order growth for advanced staining. The core histology business was flat in the quarter, largely driven by weakness in Europe.  Our Life Sciences businesses experienced flat core growth in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew modestly in the quarter. However, orders were up mid-teens, positioning the business well for strong core growth in the upcoming quarters. Mid single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and emerging markets was largely offset by weakness in Europe. The team continues to do an excellent job on the margin front as core margins were up over 100 basis points in the quarter. At the Pittcon conference in February, SCIEX debuted several new products, including the 4500 Series of mass spectrometer, the Eksigent 100 series of analytical flow rate liquid chromatography products and a new micro flow rate instrument. The 4500 delivers 10x better sensitivity compared to competitive systems in the same midrange class and is well suited for applications in high-growth applied markets. The 4500 replaces the 4000 series, which is the best-selling mass spectrometer in company history. The 4500 was just named top new product at Pittcon by Instrument Business Outlook. Leica Microsystems sales were down slightly in the quarter as solid demand in the life science research and industrial markets in North America and the emerging markets was offset by weakness across Europe.  Beckman Coulter continues to exceed our expectations, as DBS continues to make an impact in many facets of the business. In addition to the progress we've made in terms of quality with the resolution of sodium and glucose, we're also making progress in other customer-facing parts of the business.  As we implement DBS across Beckman, we've been able to increase our on-time new instruments installations in the U.S. by more than 20% and reduced unscheduled service calls by close to 15% since the closing last June. We've also seen a dramatic decrease in past-due schedule maintenance calls, which will be closed in June, numbered over 2,000 and today are below 200 with the line of sight to an even lower number. As customers see the progress, the improvements are starting to show up in the numbers. Previously, we talked about improvements in the retention and new win rates in November and December of last year. And the first quarter saw a continuation of those trends, resulting in the second consecutive quarter of positive, though modest, revenue growth.  Operating margins in the quarter improved over 400 basis points year-over-year and represented the best Q1 performance since 2006. While there's a lot of work ahead, we are happy with what the team has accomplished in the past 9 months.  Turning to Dental. Segment revenues and core revenues increased 1/2 of 1% in the first quarter. Reported operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.7%, reflecting the actions we have taken to accelerate their profitability.  Dental consumables' core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by sales for our orthodontic solutions and infection prevention products across most major geographies. This was largely offset by softness in our general dentistry consumables where we believe our sell-in to distribution partners was less than our sellout. During the quarter, we introduced several new orthodontic products, including the Damon Clear passive self-ligating bracket solution for the lower arch. Customer reaction here has been extremely positive.  Kerr reached a significant milestone during the quarter with the millionth SonicFill shipment. SonicFill is a first-of-its-kind product that enables clinicians to perform posterior restorations with a fast, easy-to-use and reliable bulk fill technology using a sonic activated handpiece. The technology, developed in conjunction with KaVo team, has been a tremendous success for Kerr and KaVo, exceeding our expectations each step of the way.  KaVo core revenues increased slightly in the quarter, with growth in imaging and equipment in North America and Europe offset by weakness in instruments globally. During the quarter, KaVo received recognition for its LUX 550 (sic) [ 540 ] LED light, which won the most innovative product in the devices and equipment category as voted on by the recent IDS trade show attendees.  Moving to our Industrial Technologies segments -- segment, revenues increased 8.5% for the quarter, with core revenues flat. Our core-operating margin declined 20 basis points in the first quarter with our reported operating margin down 150 basis points to 20.6%. Product Identification core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by solid global demand for consumables and Videojet's continuous inkjet printers, primarily in Europe and Latin America.  As I mentioned earlier, last week we announced a merger agreement with X-Rite, headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, X-Rite manufacturers, markets and supports innovative color solutions through measurement systems, software, color standards and services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.  The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.03 in 2012 and $0.04 accretive in 2013. We're excited about the strategic opportunities that lie ahead for Esko and X-Rite, and I look forward to sharing more about this opportunity with you in the coming months. Our Motion businesses' core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, with softness in the industrial automation technology and renewable energy markets across most major geographies. We are encouraged by recent order trends, as this was the second quarter in a row where our book to bill has exceeded 1.0. As a result, we expect to resume growth in the second half of the year. So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. We were particularly please with the team's execution, which led to excellent core operating margin expansion, cash flow and earnings performance and are encouraged by the momentum with which we exited the first quarter. The sequential improvement within the quarter, solid bookings growth and an attractive acquisition environment, we believe, positions us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond.  We are initiating second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.76 to $0.81 for the quarter, which includes approximately $0.01 of anticipated dilution from the pending X-Rite acquisition. The second quarter earnings per share guidance assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth. We are nearing -- narrowing our full year diluted EPS guidance from $3.20 to $3.35 to $3.25 to $3.35, which includes $0.03 of anticipated dilution from X-Rite.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Agasta, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Larry, can you fill out the thoughts a little bit on China? You guys have talked about some of the signs you had seen of easing there last -- on the last call. Have you seen things sort of play out through the quarter, and how has that contributed to this overall kind of pickup in orders you've seen through the quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: Right. Well, I think, Shannon, China was certainly central to a good bit of what we saw improved during the course of the quarter. Our book to bill in China in the first quarter was greater than 1.1. I think that's obviously helpful in terms of our internal metrics. I'd add to that in a number of businesses, Water particularly, we saw strengthening through the quarter in our project funnel, and I think that's part of what gives us the optimism that some of the external data that we see strengthening, like PMI suggested, as we go through the year here, China should get better. So we obviously were pleased with what we saw in China. I wouldn't say by the same token that it was particularly surprising in that regard. And as we look here, I think we'll see strong acceleration in China, and we should see China, I think, in the mid to high single-digit range here straightaway the second quarter.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And you said it was flat in 1Q, right?
H. Lawrence Culp: Correct.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit about the trajectories on TEK instruments versus Motion? So I think TEK was down like mid single digits in the quarter; Motion, high singles. You said TEK is going to improve through the year. I mean, does that go positive already in 2Q? I know Motion doesn't. It stays negative. So can you just talk about, I guess, the different trajectories and improvement in those 2 businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think they will -- both businesses will improve, in part because obviously the comps will get easier in both businesses. And again, I think we're seeing encouraging trends, both with respect to our internal metrics, i.e., bookings, in addition to some of the external data points, be it PMI, NASDAQ, what have you. That said, I think that it's going to take TEK longer to go positive. I think they'll both be challenged here in the second quarter. I suspect we'll see Motion go positive in the second half. It may well be though, Shannon, I think until the fourth quarter that TEK instruments is positive on the core front.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Larry, could you just maybe just give a little bit more color on -- in terms of the full year outlook? Can we -- you gave us, obviously, a lot of detail back in December, but the earnings number have come up by $0.05 at the low end. But in terms of your businesses or geographies, can you just maybe just give a bit more context in terms of what you're seeing right now compared to December?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that what we said in December, again, I think played out, by and large, as anticipated here in the first quarter. I think that as we look forward here, Nigel, again, I think we are encouraged by a number of the bookings trends that we saw, particularly in the U.S. and the emerging markets. We again saw that spread between the U.S. and Europe. This time about 700 basis points. Obviously, we saw Europe soften a bit. One key point with respect to Europe as we look forward is the second quarter is really the last quarter of last year that we'll be working. Hence, what we saw, a mid single-digit growth. So the European comparisons get a little easier, but we're not anticipating any rebound in the underlying market conditions in Europe. That said, I think the U.S. book-to-bill numbers, the sellout -- the sell-in/sellout dynamics, our funnels and the like give us optimism that barring some change in the macro scene, the U.S. will continue to be good and strong for us. If we look at emerging markets x China, we're very pleased with what we saw in the first quarter. We were up high single digits. And again, if that holds as we would suspect it will, that, in combination with improving China, gives us more tailwind out of the emerging markets than we've seen here in the last couple of quarters. So I think all-in, we certainly have a number of dynamics that we're working through. We talked to TEK. We talked to Motion a moment ago. But on balance, with what we've seen in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, very encouraged there. I think when you look at Product Identification, there as well encouraging outlook. Environmental, both within Water and at GVR, I think it's going to be getting better as we go through the year. So barring some sort of cataclysmic macro change, we think we're going to continue to see the acceleration we talked about with you in New York in December.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then the sell-in versus sellout dynamics, have we seen that channel destocking? Would you characterize that as now largely complete, or are you still seeing some pressure there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that where we saw it, Nigel, probably most pronounced in T&M and in Dental. I would say that it probably, by and large, has run its course, but I wouldn't want to speak for the network distribution partners that we have around the world. I think a number of them, despite good, healthy sell-through in the first quarter, continue to take a conservative posture. That's -- we're going to play the long game here and work with them to make sure they are stocked with products that they need and that we're both generating demand in the marketplace. But in terms of that continuing at the rate that it has here of late, I would find it -- I find that unlikely to be the case.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one more, if I may. Environmental margins were down year-over-year. Could you just maybe just talk about that? Was that mainly mix?
Daniel L. Comas: Nigel, it's a little bit of mix. But it was really more investment. They had a nice step-up. I mean, overall, across the segment, good step-up in year-on-year gross margin percentage. We have stepped up some investment there. Obviously, the ballast water is part of that as well. The margins were obviously relatively flat year-on-year, but a lot of that was driven by increased investment.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Does that continue through the year?
Daniel L. Comas: You'll see some improvement, in part because we expect growth -- better core growth through the balance of the year, but that step-up investment will continue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On X-Rite, I was hoping you could walk through the value proposition of this business, both from the color brand management but also a bit more on the technologies. If I'm not mistaken, there's some overlaps with, of all businesses, Hach, in the photo spectrometer side.
H. Lawrence Culp: Deane, you're absolutely right. We actually -- we're once in the color business back in the old days with Dr. Lange. Both Lange and Hach used similar spectrophotometric technology to glean the end [ph] results that their instruments produced. So it's a space that we know for a long time. I think that with X-Rite -- or excuse me, with Esko, our perspective on X-Rite really evolved from it being an attractive opportunity won that just made a ton of sense. It was the #1 company atop the Esko funnel. I think from a value perspective for shareholders, I think we'd say that this is an attractive $600 million adjacency to what we do within Product Identification, good underlying growth. I think the company clearly is the market leader here. They have a strong 3 to 4x share lead on competition. Two great brands in both X-Rite and Pantone. I think you see all that play out both in the 60% gross margins and the 20% operating margins. And I think the deal economics are such that we should hit that double-digit return within 3 years, probably do better than that as we have at Esko. So in terms of the space, the company, the deal, we like that. What X-Rite enables us to do is basically help brand managers throughout their entire supply chain, from the time they conceive the packaging for a new soda or a new tube of toothpaste all the way until that packaging is manufactured and sent into the distribution network, to not only manage the packaging of thoughtfully only in a digital frame, but now add to that the key element of color management. So whether you talk to a Unilever, a Proctor, a Coke, they see this as a fundamental challenge and opportunity in their business, not only with respect to cost savings but often have literally scores of versions of a white, a red, a yellow, but also the complexity as their businesses have globalized in keeping those brands' standards up to the global standard. So we're off to a great start with Esko. As you well know, this has been a -- this is a strong grower for us from the get-go, and I think the opportunity to partner with X-Rite is going to be another good addition to Danaher, but also turbo charge what we're doing in Product ID going forward.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then over on the tool side, for Apex Tools, can you comment on operating results? And I know you have to be a bit guarded in how you comment on the -- both the timing, but are you thinking about the opportunities to monetize this asset, and what might the timing be?
Daniel L. Comas: Deane, this is Dan. Off to a good start there. The combined business posted the best-ever gross margins in their history, even on a kind of pro forma basis, very good operating margins as well and actually a little bit slow here in Europe, but continued good progress in the emerging markets. We're not going to comment on external rumors. I think we said from the start, we wanted to -- the teams really get after a lot of the cost savings and the go-to-market opportunities that, that continues, and we'll see what happens over time.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: But -- is it fair to say that the whole thesis of putting these 2 businesses together is playing out at or above plan?
Daniel L. Comas: I think we and Cooper could not be happy with the team's execution and the benefit we thought we will achieve by putting the units together.
H. Lawrence Culp: And they've been a very constructive partner, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Wood of Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So, Larry, can you just give a bit more color on Beckman? Obviously you had some modest growth there, better than the flat you talked about. Can you parse out kind of the core chemistry in immunoassay businesses from the life science's piece? And any expectation on a troponin refiling or change in expectation? We'd love to hear an update there.
H. Lawrence Culp: Jon, let me try to cover a number of those bases. I think we couldn't be happier, just as a headline, with where we are. As you point out from a performance perspective, the top line is improving, there's no doubt about it. That is in part a function of, I think, what we're doing on the quality and the service front. I'll come to that in a moment. But obviously, we're also seeing, I think, excellent progress on the cost side. The -- in terms of the core, we were at a low single-digit growth number. We were not flat. We'll take that as encouragement. That's 2 quarters in a row now. I think the underlying dynamic there really is in and around the retention and the win rates, which continue to improve. What we saw back last year continued through the course of the first quarter. We were up, I think, on a retention-rate basis of about 700 basis points, say, the last 5 months versus the preceding 5 months. So good traction there just for a whole host of different reasons. The win rates are improving as well. So if you think about that as a trajectory, I think we're -- we couldn't be more pleased with the recovery in the marketplace and in turn, so there is a lag effect to growth in the business. On the cost side, we were really pleased with the way the first quarter played out. If you go back in time, you really have to go back to '06 to see them at 16% at the operating level. That's more than 400 basis points from where we were a year ago. Lots of things coming in as we had anticipated. I think from an integration perspective, the reception to Danaher DBS continues to be thoughtful, strong, just -- as good as it could be. You talked about the Diagnostics and Life Science split. We have split the businesses, as you know, organizationally. We will be -- once we're in the core growth reporting mode, we will report those businesses separately. But to your question as to how the core growth splits, both Dx and Life Sciences were, in essence, both at that low single-digit rate. The organizational evolution is part of that; integration continues. We brought on a new Chief Medical Officer, an important and critical hire. There are a number of other things that we're doing lower down in the organizational chart now that I think bodes well for the future. And you asked about troponin, on the quality and service front, I think we continue to see DBS changing the way that we are doing the work there. Quality clearly is job one. Very pleased with some of the other assays that I mentioned in the prepared remarks that have been cleared, sodium and glucose. Troponin has been slightly slower, but the results have been steady. The progress good. And I would expect that while we're not going to try to provide a realtime update on these filings going forward, we should be in a good place on troponin very soon.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right, very comprehensive.
H. Lawrence Culp: Services also, Jon, just if I can just add one final point. What we're doing on the service side, you heard some of the data around: installation performance up 20% from a year ago; unscheduled service calls down 15%; a 90% reduction in past-due maintenance calls. These are all sorts of things that most Danaher businesses take for granted. Huge opportunity for us to possibly impact customers in Beckman by way of DBS. So all in all, a long way still to go here. But 9 months in, we're thrilled.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right, great. That was very comprehensive. My follow-up just quickly on SCIEX. Did -- up modestly but bookings up mid-teens. How impactful was the introduction of the 4500 intra-quarter? Meaning, did it impact the shipments of kind of that legacy system? And was that the primary driver to the booking strength kind of in the, say -- let's call it, the second half of March? Or did that not -- did you not start to book actual business from the 4500 in the quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: Jon, the introduction of the 4500, while exciting, really isn't a material part of that dynamic. I would say that really what we saw was strengthening in the order books at SCIEX through the course of the quarter. Timing's part of the reason you see that book shift delta that we highlighted. And obviously, with a bookings quarter like that in the double digits, it gives us a lot of optimism on top of what we introduced at Pittcon. And hopefully, we've got a few things to show at ASMS that as we go through the year, we should continue to see AB SCIEX be an important growth driver for the segment and for the corporation.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You guys mentioned automation being weak. You kind of called it out. You don't usually do that in the 10-Q. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of color geographically, and how bad was it in the quarter for Motion?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that automation -- remember, the machine builders that we service at Motion, both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, have seen build rates in some of the verticals that we serve as we highlighted, Steve, slow. I think the build rates are clearly what's impacting our growth in those segments currently -- or in that segment -- those businesses currently. I think we are heartened by the strengthening in the order book, in the book to bill. But as you well know, that's going to really be a second half positive sector on our core growth in those businesses. So I wouldn't say that it was horrible or disaster, anything like that. But I think coupled with some of the softness that we've seen in China, particularly in some of the clean tech verticals there, that combination had Motion down in the quarter as we described.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. But that automation stuff, that's separate from the technology you called out. They seem like 2 separate kind of discrete end markets you were talking about.
H. Lawrence Culp: That's correct.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then the -- just the China pickup. I mean, is this -- it seems kind of interesting that it's -- it kind of turns on a dime here. I mean, you see one good kind of month of lending come out of China. I mean, do you find it kind of strange that the translation from what you see in kind of the macro data converts that quickly to orders, or is there something different going on there? Is it really kind of a loosening, or is it just end of destocking? It just seems to kind of have turned on a dime for you at the end of the quarter, from flat to up 8.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I'm not sure I would characterize China turning on a dime here at quarter's end. We certainly saw slowing through the second half, anticipated a slow but improving start to the year, and I think that's, on balance, what we saw. I think that we would have anticipated in a few places, frankly, the business to have done a little bit better. If I look at Water, for example, encouraged by the funnel build here, but we were down in China in the year or in the quarter against what was not a particularly strong comp. We talked to Motion. That's an important dynamic for us in the quarter in China as well, as is Tektronix.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Sure. But I guess but flat to up high single digits in the second quarter seems like a pretty significant turn.
Daniel L. Comas: It is, but part of that is just the calendar. A lot of what -- a lot of the improvement we're expecting in Q2, we booked in March. So I mean, our order growth rate was much better than our shipment growth rate in China in the first quarter. So we go in with a fair amount of backlog. So -- yet, from a shipment perspective, we're thinking flat to maybe mid to high single. But from an order perspective, it's gotten better but that trajectory not quite as steep, if that makes sense.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And then just one more quick question. If I do the math on a 3% to 5% organic in the second quarter, I'm getting to something like a 20% incremental margin to get to your EPS numbers. Am I missing something there? And that's x dilution. I've kind of pulled that out. So is there some reason why the incrementals are to going to be -- core incrementals are going to be weaker in the second quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, I'd have to look at -- I'd look at that. I'd be -- I don't think I'd be surprised if it's that low. And there could be some -- I don't know if there's any acquisition noise in there. There may be again -- some with X-Rite. But I would expect to be more in the 30s, but I'd be happy to look at that with you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays Capital.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Guys, I want to get a sense, your long-term core growth rate has always been -- your target at least has been 5% plus. And I went back and looked at the average. I think since '99, it averages kind of 3.1%. Since the last 5 or 6 years, it's 3.5%. I mean, how much should we care about this? I mean, DBS obviously helps a lot of margins, but it doesn't seem to be doing much on core growth. I mean, it's -- you spent a fair amount on R&D. I mean, is this something that becomes an increasing focus as time goes on or just the nature of kind of your business model? You have to bring in assets like Beckman and kind of slow down growth to fix things, and that's just kind of what we should expect is this 3% to 4% rather than a 5% to 6% or something. How do you think about that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, I would, for one, not accept and wouldn't allow anyone on the payroll to accept 3% to 4% core growth through the cycle on a core basis for this portfolio. I mean, we certainly have -- I think, as you look across the business stem to stern, a strong set of businesses. Clearly, new businesses are going to come in. They're not going to be performing at a peak level. But that said, I think we're a mid single-digit-plus grower through the cycle with the businesses that we have. And anything we bring in will be brought in to strengthen our ability to grow, let alone generate margin expansion returns for shareholders. So I would argue that DBS has positive impact on business top and bottom line, on the balance sheet as well. This is a quarter perhaps with the headline number, though it being, I think, what we had talked about for some time, working against the highest growth quarter from a year ago, it's not a headline we relish putting out there. But that said, I think as we look at the underlying trends of the businesses, whether we look at book to bill and backlogs, whether we look at how we're performing in our markets, some of these issues around the channel dynamics at the start of the year, I think we feel very good about the acceleration that we talked about. The comps do get easier. That's an element to be sure. But there's no reason you should lower your expectations. I'm not lowering my expectations with respect to what we can do through the cycle.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: No, that's a very fair answer. Just getting back to your point on the sell-in versus the sellout. It seems like kind of a common theme in this call that your distributors were taking down some inventory. But what if -- why was that exactly? I mean, is it product cycle? Is it -- it was just kind of timing? I mean, how -- what's the common theme there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that they're -- I think it's hard to characterize what we saw, Scott, in 2 very different markets, T&M on one hand, Dental in another, with 2 or 3 truly common denominators. I think that said, we saw, I think, in a number of places at the end of last year, despite good sellout, a cautious position on inventory on the part of a number of our partners, all managed businesses, that carried into this year, again, despite some of the strength that we were seeing at that counter and elsewhere on a sell-through basis. I think that corrects itself. It has to. So I'm heartened by the sell-through. The inventory adjustments that we've taken in the short-term perhaps created a little pressure. But I think you take the long view here, we want to be working with partners who are growing at or above market. We want to be their core or their key supply partners, and I think we're in that position. Again, part of the rationale, part of the logic that gives us the confidence to say as we move forward here, we'll benefit from that pickup at that readjustment, if you will, on the top line.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So just as a quick follow-up, Larry. I mean, when you think about the evolution of Danaher over time, I mean, does it become more important that you compensate managers for core growth kind of going forward given the size of the asset base you have now or not? I mean, I -- not knowing exactly how you compensate everybody. But when you think about it, does that become a greater emphasis over time that, "Hey, look. This is -- these are the assets we have, and we need to grow them. We need to gain share. We need to grow them, and 4% aren't going to get it done." So how do you compensate people to kind of do that, to accelerate that?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, big important topic. Let me simply say this. Yes, we have been increasing the weighting of core in our comps gains. And we'll continue to do that, not because we want to be a 5% to 7% versus the 4% to 5%. But the fact of the matter is, these businesses that are part of the Danaher portfolio, the bets that we have made are growth businesses and growth markets, right. So this is not a Danaher of a different time where some might reflect was simply a margin play. I don't think it was true then, but it's certainly not the case today. And we need to make sure that we are growing these businesses in order to perpetuate the leadership positions that they enjoy in their markets. If their market share as good as we think and the businesses are strong and get stronger, we should be delivering numbers more in line with what, I think, your expectations are pretty much in line with my own.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Larry, can you just maybe start with the math on the $5 billion, given about almost $3 billion of cash, free cash flow, that you're looking at? How are you -- just walk me through me the math on why it's not a bigger number at this point.
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I think we talked about at least capacity of at least $5 billion. That's on top of X-Rite, which is at over $600 million. So that's roughly 2 years of current cash flow, and the math is not any more complicated than that.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And in terms of your willingness to borrow or drive the balance sheet any harder, I mean, we obviously -- you see that in select situations. Have you -- has your thinking changed on that front at all?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I mean, clearly, we've gotten bigger. Our cash flow has gotten larger. Our ability to borrow more under our current credit rating increases, and we would expect that to continue.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, okay. And then back to the core growth question. Just a couple. One clarification. If I just comped on number of days versus a year ago, was that taking off about 1.5% or 1% or 1.5% in terms of how you think about the core growth numbers you just put up?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, we had the same number of shipping days, both Q1.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. So no impact on that front.
Daniel L. Comas: That's right.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And then the NPVI number is still hovering 29%, right, or around high 20s?
H. Lawrence Culp: You're talking about vitality new products kind of sales?
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes. And I guess the question there is what -- if you think about this over time as indicative, we're going through quarter after quarter of constant drumbeat of new product introductions. That as year by year goes by, we're -- I'm expecting to see those start to gain a lot more traction. Is that -- are you -- what -- how do you think about that number? And I'm looking for other ways to think about core growth and traction on that from DBS, et cetera, to some of the earlier comments made, and wondering if that's not a decent way to think about it.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think it's one important piece of the puzzle, Steve. But I think there are a whole host of factors, innovation, new products is one. Obviously the success of what we do from a sales marketing and service perspective, another. And what we're able to do out of the factory in terms of quality delivery is a third. That are parts of that mosaic that we are executing well on the right things could allow us to grow at or above market rates. So I wouldn't want to get too fixated on any one input in that regard. I really do think it takes a broad integrated effort to drive the share gains that we see at a place like Videojet or ChemTreat that we've seen over the last several years.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And you think 30% is roughly the right number? Or are you not sort of -- even though it's only one metric as you mentioned, you're not sort of thinking that, that thing should be 35% to 40%?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think I we would always like to take numbers like those that you believe in your gut are correlated with growth and share up. But that number -- the right number for certain businesses will be higher than it will be for others, right. You take a business like Leica Micro or Tektronix where product life cycles are a little shorter, maybe the competitive intensity is a bit more than we might see elsewhere, they need to be at a higher number. Likewise, if you look at some of, say, the Water businesses, be it Hach Lange with a high consumable stream or ChemTreat, the new product or the vitality ratio there is not likely to be that high, in part just because of the way you do the math, if you're being honest about it. Obviously, we would be. So I think we try to calibrate those sorts of metrics business by business. So the -- no one business goes off chasing a corporate mandate or trying to clear a corporate bar that isn't appropriate to the context of the market they compete in.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: A lot of ground covered. Let me just be quick, 1 or 2 items. U.S. muni, Larry, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing there? And is this kind of -- there's some random projects that have started to hit, or are you actually seeing -- ground swell's maybe too strong a word, but some true pickup on underlying activity?
H. Lawrence Culp: Jeff, I would say it's more underlying activity than big projects per se being let. So we will see that most positively at Hach, again because that's more of a razor blade's model as you know there. Conversely, that will pinch us a bit over time at Trojan as those big projects are slowing.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And your visibility on China muni, I think you said orders picking up. You have pretty good visibility on when those actually get let and move forward, or is it still just kind of order activity and pipeline building?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I would say that we have good visibility there, Jeff, with respect to projects. Again, given the selling cycle, given the way the municipalities plan these efforts and when initial planning commences compared to when we actually ship product, there's a good -- there's a bit of time there. The challenge is really applying historical practice and trends to that funnel and trying to anticipate when orders will be let. I think through the back half of last year and even here early in the year, we've just seen certain projects get pushed a bit more than we would have anticipated, more than we have seen historically. So I think that's why we're particularly heartened with the book to bill there. So we're seeing these funnels improve. That's good. Seeing a north of one of book to bill, even better. So that's the way I would describe it. It's certainly better visibility than we have in some other businesses, but it's been a little noisy, say, in the last 6 to 9 months.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And then just finally, maybe for Dan. Price play any role in the organic growth number this quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: There's a little bit over half a point. Q1 is often a little bit light for us in price. I think that will get a little bit better. Again, we're getting pretty good price on consumables, though it's relatively flat on equipment and instruments.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Just a couple of quick ones. First is just a clarification. Larry, you gave organic growth or kind of core growth expectations for 2Q. And I may have missed it, but for the full year, there's no change to your core growth outlook. Is that right?
Daniel L. Comas: That's right.
H. Lawrence Culp: That's right, Jon.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then, Larry, if I think about Europe, all of the danger that Europe is not one country, right, but if I look at Europe, I'd say it's a little -- if I see the results coming out of your business, it's not exactly what I would expect, things like SCIEX and Leica Microsystems down, PID up. Can you maybe just talk about what's -- what you see happening in Europe and maybe how that's trended over the last few months, just given everything that we read in here over there and maybe your interpretation of what's happening?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I was in Europe this week. I'm not sure that having been there recently gives me any truly unique perspective, Jon. I think things are simply sluggish in a whole host of places. We can, I think, understand what happened at Leica and SCIEX again. While softening, we are heartened by some of the leading indicators. But that said, probably the best thing we have going for us right now in Europe is the simple fact that the comparisons get easier as we get into the second half. We say goodbye to these mid single-digit growth quarters that we saw last year, and that will help what we print. But while we're not, I think, unduly pessimistic about Europe, I don’t think we harbor any illusions about the underlying economy, particularly in those places where it's soft, bouncing back dramatically as we go through 2012.
Daniel L. Comas: And, Jon, as you point out, it's not soft across the board. We were talking about the muni business and the Water business in the U.S. Actually, we had a good first quarter in our municipal business in Europe. You mentioned Videojet, still decent growth, Radiometer as well. So we still have some key businesses that are performing reasonably well in Europe. So it's not soft everywhere.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: So outside of just broadly, you said being sluggish, it's not like you can look over the last 3 or 4 months trends in any particular businesses or orders that are going on that you can draw some conclusion about. You just kind of expect broadly sluggish just across all the businesses.
Daniel L. Comas: Q1 played out very much as we expected, which is consistent sequentially from Q4 kind of the normal seasonality. Some business is soft and some businesses still posting pretty good numbers.
H. Lawrence Culp: But, Jon, to Dan's point, I mean, rest assured, from an operating perspective, whether you cut it by company, whether you cut it by country, it doesn't mean those teams all get to take a pass on '12, right. There are countries where we see particular businesses, Dan highlighted a few good examples, where there are opportunities we should be able to grow. And at a minimum, you're always able to grab share. But when you roll it all up, obviously, Europe is going to be the challenge for us from a geographic perspective this year.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just, if I can, quickly on Dental. For first quarter, it looks like all-time high margins and pretty good improvement year-over-year. Is that just -- I know you've been focusing on that. Is that sustainable where we're at or there are some particular onetime items in the quarter? How do you think about the margins there?
Daniel L. Comas: They were not -- Jon, they were not onetime items. We got off to a very good start. We had a very good Q4 that was masked from a reporting perspective because of all the restructuring we did. I just saw that play out nicely in the first quarter and if you look at that segment and you would add back the amortization, we actually grew up from an operating -- through operating profit perspective, we're north of 15% in the quarter. So off to a good start and think we can sustain that.
Operator: We have time for one more question. That will come from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And congrats on the X-Rite acquisition. I think that is going to look very good on Videojet and Esko. Just in terms of the Test & Measurement business, and I guess when I look at the distribution channel itself, are you very comfortable that there's no share gain or loss going on in the distribution channel on the instrument side of Test & Measurement, in particular at TEK, given this -- the sell-in is lower than the sell-through? And Dental, I would think you'd have a better perspective given the channel there is more concentrated, more consolidated. But are you comfortable that there's no share gains or losses in the channel on the instrument side in T&M?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think if we look at T&M, and when we talk about this dynamic, we're talking about both Fluke and TEK, you're going to have puts and takes in any one month, any one quarter. But I think if we look at the last year or 2 in those businesses, I don't see it. I know some others may suggest otherwise. But I think if we look at those businesses, particularly with the new product momentum that we think we'll generate going through the year, what we're doing to generate brand preference, let alone broad end-user demand, we're doing good work there. And I think as we go through the year, again, barring change in the macro environment, that will present itself more than it has here in the first quarter in our top line numbers. And I think in Dental, the same dynamic applies. I didn't mean to leave them out.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: No, that's fine. And then also just within the T&M business and the instrument piece, is it fair to say -- is the tone of business and the book to bill, was it greater than one in China, and the tone of business strong -- or kind of maybe turning in China versus Europe? Have we seen the bottom in the T&M side?
H. Lawrence Culp: I'm sorry, Rick. You're talking about the T&M in China, have we seen bottom?
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Within the instrument businesses, within the T&M business, so really Tektronix and Fluke. Are we -- have we seen the bottom in Europe? And conversely, is the tone of business turned in China? I'm just trying to distinguish between geographies there?
Daniel L. Comas: Rick, overall, our book to bill was nicely north of one for instrument in the first quarter. I'm not sure I have that broken down geographically. It's obviously encouraging given we had a sub-one in the fourth quarter, to see that go north of one in the first quarter is a good sign.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just, Dan, real quickly. Just one question on CapEx. CapEx in the quarter looked significantly high. Does that back off this year or is that a good numbering?
Daniel L. Comas: That's really the dynamic of Beckman and the leasing model.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I see, okay. Okay. So as we see growth there, that number will spike up some?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes.
Operator: And Mr. McGrew, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks for joining us, everybody. Dan and I are around today for follow-ups.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 2011 was another outstanding year for Danaher. For the full year, we saw high single-digit core revenue growth, core margin expansion of 160 basis points, adjusted earnings per share growth north of 25% and $2.4 billion of free cash flow. However, the numbers only tell part of the story. During the year, we continued to capture market share through both innovative new product introductions and our go-to-market initiatives. For the first time in 2011, our R&D spend exceeded $1 billion. And this continued investment has played a significant part in the share gains at many of our businesses, including Videojet, Leica, AB SCIEX, Hach and ChemTreat. In 2011, we significantly improved the Danaher portfolio. We announced or closed 17 acquisitions during the year, most notably of course Beckman Coulter and Esko, while at the same time transitioning out some of our legacy businesses that were no longer considered significant core growth opportunities for us. 10 years ago, approximately 50% of our revenues were derived from what we considered to be our strategic growth segments. In 2012, that number will be nearly 90%, reflecting the evolution of our portfolio towards higher growth, higher margin, more global businesses where our brands are clear market leaders. Last month at our year-end meeting, we talked about seeing strengthening in our businesses in early December. We saw that momentum carry through December, and we finished the fourth quarter with 4% core revenue growth, modestly better than we anticipated. During the quarter, we delivered strong operational performance with our core operating margin improving 100 basis points, despite investing $40 million in incremental year-over-year non-Beckman-related restructuring actions.  From a geographic perspective, emerging markets continue to grow at a faster rate than developed markets, although the gap narrowed in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of Beckman Coulter, sales from the developed markets grew low single digits in the quarter with the U.S. doing noticeably better than Europe. Emerging markets grew at a mid-single-digits rate.  In the second half of last year, we grew our emerging markets businesses to the point where revenues, now at 23% of our total, are equal to those in Western Europe. This balance provides a natural hedge given the headline risks in Europe today. And going forward, our emerging market exposure will undoubtedly be greater than that of Western Europe. All in, a strong finish to a good and important year. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the fourth quarter. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.81, which includes $120 million of restructuring, representing a record fourth quarter for Danaher and a 26.5% increase as compared to our adjusted diluted EPS last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.83, a 28.5% increase compared to 2010. And as we discussed in December, we were able to accelerate restructuring across all the businesses with our Industrial Technology and Dental segments receiving the largest investments.  Revenues for the quarter increased 37.5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 4%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 33.5%. Our full-year 2011 revenues were up 28% year-over-year to $16.1 billion with core revenues up 7%. Our year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter decreased 250 basis points to 49.3% while our operating margin in the fourth quarter decreased 80 basis points year-over-year to 16.5%. Both decreases were primarily due to the incremental year-over-year restructuring activity and the impact of noncash acquisition-related costs and lower margins at Beckman Coulter. For the full year, our gross margin was 50.8% and our operating margin was 16.3%. DBS continues to be the primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. 2011 operating cash flow was $2.7 billion, a 35% increase compared to 2010. Free cash flow from continuing operations was a record $2.4 billion, and our free cash flow from continuing operations to net income ratio was 124%, representing the 20th year in a row where we delivered free cash in excess of net income. This is the first year Danaher's free cash flow has exceeded $2 billion. In the second half of last year, we paid down more than $1.2 billion of debt. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of 10 businesses, including 5 in the last 2 weeks of the year. The fourth quarter acquisitions have aggregate annual revenues of approximately $100 million and are expected to strengthen our Environmental, Test & Measurement, Dental, and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments.  Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 7% for the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the year, revenues increased 19.5% with core revenues up 9.5%. Test & Measurement's core operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 230 basis points. Reported operating margin increased 170 basis points to 21.5%.  Fluke core revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, with solid demand in the emerging markets for our industrial, automation and calibration products partially offset by weakness in Europe. During the quarter, Fluke acquired Martel Electronics, a manufacturer of calibration process tools for industrial applications. Fluke also acquired 2 Asian distribution partners to accelerate our penetration in the region. At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly in the quarter with solid demand for our video solutions and service offerings more than offset by weaker demand in our core bench top instruments. We're encouraged by the sequential improvement in monthly sales through the fourth quarter and early signs that some of the credit issues facing our Chinese distributors are easing. The market perception for our newly launched MDO4000, the world's first Mixed Domain Oscilloscope, has been overwhelmingly positive with 5 significant industry awards received to date.  Core revenues at our communications businesses grew high single digits in the quarter led by healthy demand for Tektronix network management solutions in North America, as well as our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. During the quarter, Arbor Networks began shipping their Pravail Availability Protection System, and customer response has been very favorable. Pravail's cloud signaling technology is truly an innovative solution facilitating communication between customers and network providers during the distributed denial of service or DdoS attack, enabling the network operators to quickly block traffic from the source of the attack, minimizing downtime for the customers' businesses. Turning to Environmental, segment revenues increased 7% in the quarter with core revenues increasing 5.5%. For the year, revenues were up 7.5% with core revenues up 4%. The segment core operating margin was up modestly in the fourth quarter with reported operating margin decreasing 20 basis points to 21.9%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a high single-digit rate.  At Hach Lange, the sales of our core lab instrumentation used in industrial applications were healthy due in part to the recent launch of the DR 3900 spectrophotometer and the HQD Benchtop meter. We saw a modest improvement in demand in the municipal business in China while the North American and Western European municipal businesses grew at low single-digit rates in the quarter. During the quarter, Hach acquired X-ray Optical Systems, a provider of x-ray fluorescent instruments, used in elemental analysis for applied and environmental applications.  At Trojan, core revenues increased at a high teens rate in the quarter, driven by growth in all major geographies with particularly strong performance in Asia, where Trojan delivered a large municipal wastewater system in Hong Kong. In December, we highlighted Trojan's ballast water treatment solution and are pleased to report today that we received our first treatment system order this month. Earlier this month as well, Trojan acquired Salsnes Filter, which provides filtration technology to remove particles from municipal wastewater and industrial process water.  ChemTreat's aggressive go-to-market investments continue to pay off with core revenues growing low double digits in the quarter, their sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth and market share gains. ChemTreat revenues have increased by more than 1/3 with operating margins expanding approximately 500 basis points since Danaher acquired the business 4 years ago. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's fourth quarter core revenues were flat with the Spencer sales up more than 10% in North America and Europe and high teens growth at Veeder-Root, offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison resulting from enhanced industry security standards in 2010. In 2011, Gilbarco generated over $30 million in revenues supplying truck stop operators with our new diesel exhaust fluid dispensers.  During the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire Acis Group to expand GVR's global footprint and to provide superior channel access in Eastern Europe. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 153.5% largely due to the addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 6% in the quarter. For the year, revenues increased 101.5% with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin was up 245 basis points in the fourth quarter while our reported operating margin decreased 10 basis points from the prior year to 13% as a result of restructuring and integration activities, noncash charges related to fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue at Beckman Coulter.  Radiometer's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the quarter driven by continued strong sales of our instruments and consumables across all major geographies. Demand for our ABL80 blood gas analyzer in the emerging markets was particularly robust, growing more than 25% in the quarter. We've had a number of very exciting regulatory approvals over the last couple of months starting with the November approval of the AQT analyzer and the full 5 assay panel in China. The Chinese market is currently growing at more than 30%.  Additionally, just last week, we received U.S. FDA approval for AQT in the myoglobin assay. Myoglobin is one of the cardiac biomarkers typically used to help diagnose or rule out heart attacks. We are still in the process of expanding the U.S. menu to the full 5 assay panel, but this clearance is an important first step for our U.S. commercialization. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues increased more than 10% in the quarter with healthy demand for our advanced staining systems globally and core histology systems in North America. Our Bond III immunohistochemistry platform grew its installed base more than 20% in 2011, continuing to drive share gains and pulling through high-margin consumables along the way.  Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate driven by sales of compound microscopes used in research applications in Europe and in Asia. Our above-market core revenue growth in confocal microscopy in 2011 is an excellent example of how innovation can provide a competitive advantage and drive market share gains. Core revenues at AB SCIEX grew at a low double-digit rate in the quarter driven by new products launched earlier in the year as well as the continued uptake of the TripleTOF 5600. Demand was broad-based with academic, applied and research markets all growing in excess of 10%. We couldn't be more pleased with the first full year at AB SCIEX. This was a challenging integration, but the team is really executing well and delivered low double-digit core growth and over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2011. During the quarter, we expanded our direct presence in India with the acquisition of Leica and AB SCIEX's distribution partner, LabIndia. This acquisition provides us with a strong foundation to broaden our commercial footprint in this increasingly important region of the world. Turning to Beckman Coulter. We've owned the business now for just over 6 months and have been very pleased with the integration as well as the performance of the business thus far. We've received an excellent reception throughout the organization, and the changes made so far are having a significant impact on the way the business is run on a daily basis.  Our focus early on has been implementing the Danaher Business System and getting the organization focused on simplicity, accountability and competitiveness. Much of what we have done in changing the organizational structure and the team has been with those 3 themes in mind. There's been a significant talent infusion, both from Danaher and from elsewhere in the industry to compliment the tremendous team at Beckman Coulter. We have 10 Danaher people now in senior positions, both in Diagnostics and Life Sciences, and there are another 25 full-time equivalents elsewhere in Danaher who are working with the Beckman team to implement the Danaher Business System. DBS has had an early impact on quality. Beckman had some well-documented quality challenges that we knew would require our utmost focus. We've been encouraged by the early signs of progress here, particularly on the assay front with resolution of sodium and glucose.  And while we've been focused on product quality, we've also made progress in product innovation and new product development. If you were with us in December, you got a chance to take a look at the new AU 5800 platform, which is now U.S. FDA approved, giving Beckman a high throughput analyzer to drive our competitiveness in this fast-growing segment of the chemistry market.  Our hematology product line has been enhanced with the launch of the DxH Slidemaker Stainer, which increases productivity and quality by automating routine slide making and staining in the hematology lab.  The cost out effort has gone better than initially expected given the fast start in December. As many of you know, we increased our total cost savings target by $100 million to $350 million and believe we're on pace to achieve $250 million of cost reduction in 2012, about 2 years ahead of schedule. While there is a lot of work ahead on both the quality and innovation fronts, we're very pleased with the progress to date. Turning to Dental segment. Revenues increased 5.5% in the fourth quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the full year, revenues were up 10%, with core revenues growing 4.5%. Our reported operating margin declined 120 basis points in the fourth quarter to 10.9%. The decline was the result of more than 400 basis points of restructuring activity, which helps position the segment for another step-up in margin in 2012.  Dental consumables core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter led by robust sales for our Damon Clear orthodontic solutions, infection prevention products and general dentistry consumables, primarily in North America and in the emerging markets.  During the quarter, we acquired the endodontic divisions of DEXIS Dental. The addition of these unique and innovative products are expected to further strengthen SybronEndo's position as a leader in the endodontic marketplace.  KaVo core revenues were flat in the quarter with solid demand for our imaging products globally offset by weakness in equipment and instruments, particularly in Europe. Dentists continued to express interest in digital radiography and 3D imaging products. And with our recently completed global launch of our new hybrid digital imaging system, we're well positioned to take advantage of these trends in 2012.  Pelton & Crane's core revenues grew low double digits in 2011 due in part to the success of its DTE or Driven to Excellence campaign, which hosted more than 400 doctors for a 2-day dental office design seminars and generated more than $10 million in sales for the year. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment. Revenues increased 15% for the quarter with core revenues up 3%. For the full year, revenues grew 23%, with core revenues up 11.5%. Our core operating margin declined 50 basis points in the fourth quarter with our reported operating margin down 70 basis points to 18.1%. The decline was a result of more than 200 basis points of restructuring activity, which will help drive further improvements in 2012. Product Identification core revenues grew low single digits in the quarter led by solid demand for Videojet continuous inkjet printers in North America. Videojet has seen tremendous success with its full suite of CIJ printers and we believe meaningfully outperformed the market in 2011. During the quarter, we launched the 6250 TTO printer to meet demand in the midrange flexible packaging market.  At Esko, revenues were up at a mid-teens rate in the quarter compared to a year ago when it was a standalone company. Demand was robust across all major geographies for both our software and our hardware product lines.  Our motion business's core revenues declined at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. The momentum of the first half of 2011 did not continue in the fourth quarter due primarily to weakness in the industrial automation, technology and solar markets in China and North America. Despite these headwinds, demand for Kollmorgen's engineered solutions for electric vehicle systems remains healthy. In the quarter the company signed a 5-year $35 million agreement to supply generators to a large multinational OEM. So to wrap up, it was clearly a very good fourth quarter and full year for Danaher. The investments we've made over the last several years in innovation and go-to-market initiatives were evident in our strong free cash flow, core revenue and earnings growth in 2011. The structural cost actions undertaken in the fourth quarter position us well for further margin expansion and allow us to fund growth opportunities where they present themselves. Financially, we're well positioned to take advantage of what we believe will be an attractive acquisition environment in 2012. We are initiating today first quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.66 to $0.71 and reaffirming our full-year guidance of $3.20 to $3.35. The first quarter earnings per share guidance assumes low single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Trish, I think we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to go back to Test & Measurement a bit, and that business has always had a fairly good macro read, if nothing else. But when you think about the slowdown in core growth in the quarter, can you walk us through the geographic kind of breakdown of where that core came from and talk to a book-to-bill there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. I think that what we saw, Scott, at T&M and I'd say both kind of in the core instruments business at both Fluke and at TEK, interestingly, was pretty good sell-through both in the U.S. and to a lesser degree in Europe. But in the face of that -- decent sell-through, we were seeing channel inventory adjustments, which led in part to the results that we've shared with you this morning. And then we've highlighted that we've seen some sequential slowing in China through the second half, and that certainly continued as we worked our way through the quarter. Obviously, a little bit more pronounced at TEK than at Fluke. But I think as we look at that, we're optimistic that, that inventory dynamic won't continue -- can't continue for too long given the POS that we've seen. And having been in China earlier in the month, I think the team is certainly mindful that we've seen the sequential slowing. They seem to be I think optimistic both at Fluke and at TEK that we'd see a sequential strengthening as we move forward from here.
Daniel L. Comas: Scott, in terms of the book to bill, we were north of one in the fourth quarter. I'm continuing to see very strong order growth at -- with our Tektronix business and the 3G LTE sort of build out. As Larry alluded to, I think we're going to face -- it will a little bit tough early in the year part given the double-digit growth we had last year. But clearly some signs out there in the sort of technology world, the PMI data, that's encouraging for that business. Now there will often tend to be a couple of quarter lag between those indicated getting a little better and us really seeing the pickup. So I think it will be a little bit slower early in the year, but there are some signs both including the order books that are encouraging as we look through the year.
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, just to add to there, I mean the backlog position at comms is significantly up from a year ago. They had a very strong bookings year and as we get into 2012, obviously, take a lot of confidence from that here at the outset.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And this is -- it's interesting you called out DBS as helping in Beckman and this is the first quarter you've done that, obviously. It's a new asset for you. But how long does it take -- I mean how long does it take to get critical mass in a company of that size to where you're ahead of the curve on the cost out? But really, how long does it take to instill kind of a DBS culture into a company that big?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that it's clearly, Scott, a multi-year effort. But when we talk about I think the progress that we're making at Beckman, and there's a lot of progress, I'll just highlight a couple of examples, we would attribute it to DBS. I think if you look at just the performance thus far, right, we're pretty much kind of as expected with respect to the top line. You clearly know that we've accelerated on the cost side of things. I think that, that discipline around top line execution, working the sales funnels in the developed markets in Asia, a large part of that comes as a result of DBS. Clearly, on the OP front, right, continue to drive sequential performance with respect to the margins, that traction that we've got around just maintaining a tighter level of spend in some of the G&A buckets, obviously, some of the headcount adjustments, all signs of early progress and to think that we're a couple of years ahead here on the cost out, I think is a large -- in large part a function of all the various tenants of the Danaher Business System being deployed. But it's just not that, right, and we talked about quality, I think that there is no small contribution being made as we resolved the sodium and glucose issues in the way that we have put in a level of rigor, a level of discipline around some of those issues. We've talked about troponin. We're working that effort with respect to the first quarter submission. I think that team, in that case, obviously, an important task, making some good progress. Probably we're slower there than we would have anticipated, which might impact the timing there. But again, I think using some of the process tools to help tackle a rather complex project. Our new product launches as well, I think important evidence, that DBS is helping on the quality front whether it be the approvals that they were able to get through at FDA in 2011, which was 2x what we did in 2010, let alone the completion of the new 5800 approval. And even with respect to the warning letter we got at Brea. We got some good news very recently relative to our reinspection where the FDA came in and as a result of the work that team has done again, using many of the process tools that we have in place or are introducing at Beckman in addition to their quality system, we ended up with no 483 observations, which is obviously very encouraging testament to the hard work that team is doing, but I think also signs of some of the early evidence or some of the early efforts with respect to DBS is impacting the way the business is operating on a day-to-day basis. We have a lot work to do, Scott. But whether you talk about performance, quality, even some of the growth -- some of the other growth efforts here, I think we're encouraged.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a question of Beckman kind of core growth looked kind of flattish, is that right?
Daniel L. Comas: Organically, yes. A little less than currency, but flat organically.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Flat, organically, okay. And then the product ID business, sorry, I might have missed that. What did you guys grow in the quarter and then any change for kind of the 2012 expectations? What are guys expecting for growth there in 2012?
Daniel L. Comas: It was up low single digits in the fourth quarter.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then what you're expecting for 2012?
Daniel L. Comas: Low to mid single digits.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And what do you think the markets growing there in 2012?
Daniel L. Comas: I think in line with that.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: In line with that, so you guys don't losing any share?
Daniel L. Comas: No, we're pretty convinced we're not losing share.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Hey, Larry, I wonder if you might summarize any changes in your views on organic growth for 2012 today relative to where we were at the analyst meeting. And I guess in particular, I'm curious about your view on Life Sciences, AB SCIEX up low double digit in the quarter, a little bit stronger than we had. I wonder if that lifts your view on 2012 for that business in particular.
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. I would say we aren't quite ready to change our outlook here a month or so since we were together in New York. Obviously, I think we were very encouraged by what we saw in December in terms of the way it played out, particularly here in the U.S. We probably haven't had this big a spread between the U.S. and Europe in some time, and that was really more a function I think of U.S. strength than European weakness. I think that said, just given all the headlines out there and maybe to a degree given the surprising level of strength at the end of the year, I think we're going to watch this very carefully. I think when you come to a year end like that, you can ask yourself how much of that was real versus budget flushing or any other year-end stimulation that might not carry forward. I think thus far in January, things are fairly well in line with our expectations. But with respect to SCIEX or Life Sciences more broadly, I don't think that, that strong finish would have us taking up just yet our outlook for 2012. Now I have been encouraged, had the opportunity here in January to be on the ground in China, in India and in the Gulf, I think the mindsets there are by and large pretty positive for the year. I think they're, particularly in China, mindful of some of the sequential slowing that they're wrestling with. But by and large, it certainly was an upbeat mood in all 3 parts of the world as we look at this year, and this will clearly be the geographies that drive much of our growth in 2012.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the Industrial business, the motion business is down. As we look at the guidance for the first quarter for the total company core up low single digits, any businesses that you would expect other than that motion business perhaps given the difficult comps continuing? Any other businesses across the portfolio you'd expect to be in negative territory?
H. Lawrence Culp: Terry, I'd say of for the quarter and frankly for the year, we don't expect any of the segments to be down. I would say that in the quarter, the instruments business at TEK and motion, probably going to be down, call it mid-singles in the quarter. And part of that I think is the way they finished, part of it's that frankly it's the fact that they've got some very tough comps here in the first quarter. You'll recall that motion was up 22% a year ago in the first quarter. I think TEK was up about 14%. So I think we're mindful for that, but again don't expect any of those businesses, let alone the segments to be down for the year. We're going to watch TEK carefully. I guess there's a possibility they could be flat for the year, but probably too early to call that definitively.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, Dan, maybe just it looks like working capital was negative for the fourth quarter to a greater extent than normal and then negative for the year. May just be a timing thing but going back in the model, I can't see a negative working capital number for the company going back to 2002. Anything to talk about there kind of looked like it was in the other category, but maybe just a timing issue there?
Daniel L. Comas: No, I think we're very pleased with working capital performance and think about we generated $1 billion of organic revenue, and organically we didn't add $1.00 of working capital. That's really what -- that's really the power of DBS and you see that in our free flow conversion. So we had a little bit of benefit of Beckman, but still in the early days really going after that working capital, but we were very pleased across the businesses that have been with us for a long time on their performance, particularly in the fourth quarter on working capital.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So on SCIEX, Larry, obviously, the trends there continue well above market despite the tougher comps, and it seems like pretty broad base from an end-market perspective. So any color you would offer on which end markets within SCIEX lead and which lag in 2012?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that's -- I think cutting it by end market, Jon, is hard right now. Again, I think in part given the outlook around some of the governmental roles here and certainly some -- maybe perhaps some of the uncertainty around pharma. I think we were pleased with the way virtually all of the end markets really ran through at a good clip at year's end. But I don't think that we would -- we're clearly not banking on anything that's government-funded being particularly robust, maybe with a couple of exceptions given what we suspect will happen in China and perhaps in Germany. I think we always watch the pharma end market with some -- with a conservative posture just given some of the issues that are going through the resets of R&D spend and R&D operations at least with big pharma. But by and large, I think that's probably how we would characterize the landscape here at the end of January.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. My follow-up is on Beckman. It actually looked pretty good from a revenue perspective if I'm doing my math right. Can you comment on any changes at the margin in kind of that core chemistry business given that you've got sodium and glucose back on the market? I mean have you seen any vitality related to that? Or are those trends still on the comp on your view?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think we've actually been quite encouraged, Jon, by the underlying metrics in the business. As you know, the core revenue performance of the business is often indicative of decisions that customers have made some time ago as opposed to what's happening here and now. I think with respect to core chemistry, maybe more a function of the launch now of the AU 5800, particularly in Europe. We're seeing our chemistry business really kind of back up on its feet. We had a significant win. In fact in the quarter, in the fourth quarter in Europe, where the 5800 was a big part of that. And that was business we weren't retaining or competing to retain. That was frankly business we've lost a couple of years ago. So I think now that we've got the 58 approved in the U.S. and we get some of the other operational issues behind us out of Mishima as you saw in December at the analyst meeting with their implementation of DBS, we're encouraged in that regard. I think more broadly, if you look at what we saw in December, really in the fourth quarter, both with respect to our retention activity as well as our competitive win rate, we were again encouraged. The growth, more room activities, the growth implementation of DBS clearly helping us just be more competitive as we get out and work to retain our install base. And in December, I think we had the best competitive win rate numbers that we've seen at least that we saw in the second half of last year. So I think the trends are certainly helpful and reinforce the work the team is doing. But we would say, it's still early and a lot of work lies ahead.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: I may not have followed all the color on Environment. What was kind of the drag, I mean I heard kind of decent trends at water quality and Trojan and ChemTreat, I might have missed Gilbarco, but what kind of held you back to the 2% growth in the quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, the growth is primarily the payment, security comp at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Jeff. We had I think really a surprisingly strong growth in all the other product lines, the core automation in the Environmental products, but that security comp, that was a tough one all year for us, was particularly onerous in the fourth quarter. And that's also part of what you see in the Environmental margins, that mix shift at Gilbarco away from payment didn't help us. Obviously, the reported margins were suppressed I guess about 20 bps or so given the restructuring. But that was a further challenge given the mix pressures at GVR.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Great. And then just the idea kind of year-end noise in various businesses. So did you actually think you saw some budget flush activity going on in parts of your business because you might have the opposite in some of the distribution businesses, right, where people were drawing down inventory and trying to free up cash. But you felt perhaps there was a different set of behaviors going on elsewhere in the portfolio? Any color on...
H. Lawrence Culp: Jeff, I think you characterized what we saw pretty well. I think across a portfolio like ours, you don't necessarily anticipate customer behavior being similar business to business to business. But we did see just a cross-section of our channel partners take a fairly conservative posture on inventory despite POS in many instances being good. So I think you put your finger on it. I think with respect to where we sell on a direct basis, we're still kind of piecing together what we saw and what it means for the first quarter here, but there probably was some of that. It's hard to kind of pinpoint it. But the fourth quarter, again, particularly in the U.S., December, all the more, was quite strong and it's quite strong all the way to the end. So it's hard to discount the possibility there was some of that in there, which again I think back to one of the earlier questions of why we're not trying to get too far ahead of ourselves here early in 2012.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And then on troponin, I don't think it's a news flash that things are going a little slow there but you did mention maybe a little slower than expected. Can you just give us an update on what the challenges are at this point and what your kind of the main hurdles you're working on?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes. I think the process of going through the recertification, as we've described before, is it's complex and we're working very closely with the agency to make sure that we have a regimen in place that satisfies their objectives as well as ours. And that's just a big, complex project. Again, I think the team is making good progress here, but at this juncture maybe a little slower in some cases than anticipated. And that's the nature of that type of work. But again, I think all in all, the balance of progress that we made on the regulatory front is very encouraging, and on that front, I think we knew those were risks that would have to be well managed at the outset with Beckman. And I'm very pleased not only in terms, if you will, the Danaher contribution, but the very strong effort on the part of the Beckman leadership and the Beckman teams that have been involved in that work.
Operator: We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just want to dig into -- I just want to dig into your 1Q guidance. I mean, I realize the range is consistent and in line with typical seasonality for your full-year guidance. But if I add back your restructuring in this quarter, you wouldn't make sense. And the drop-down to 1Q is obviously a lot heavier than we normally see. So what are the big swing factors between 4Q and 1Q aside from your normal conservatism?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I mean we've probably added a little bit to the seasonality with Beckman. Beckman had a terrific fourth quarter, but it is also seasonally the strongest and Q1 is seasonally the weakest for Beckman. So I think you've got a -- if you look at historically, the step down is not that far out of line with what we normally see and you add to that the impact of Beckman. That probably explains most of it.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then Larry, could you maybe calibrate your inventory commentary because it sounds like we saw a big inventory drop in China particularly with Endotronics [ph] in early part of 4Q and then that normalized. How would you comment on just general inventory trends you saw during 4Q and do you think we're done with that process?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that probably it's too early to declare that we're through it. I think our partners are, like everyone else, trying to sort out what sort of start to the year we're going to see and have come into the year, I think, conservatively positioned. But again, I think we saw that play across the portfolio in the quarter in a whole host of different places. It was clearly, I think almost in defiance of what we're seeing with respect to POS in the U.S. and even in Europe. Obviously, we did see slowing in China. I mentioned some of the credit contraction that we saw. I can't think of an example, Nigel, where we had distributors who were having credit issues -- at least, situations where that was flagged in the U.S. or in Europe in the way that it was in some of the emerging markets, particularly in China. So I think we're optimistic that this does have a short life to it, but ultimately those inventory positions will be a function of sell-out. We'll see how that plays out here in the first couple of months to 2012.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just finally on the deals on 4Q. It looks like you paid a sales multiple about 1.2x. That's quite a bit lower than your normal multiples. Are you seeing any signs that the multiples off by sellers are coming in a little bit?
Daniel L. Comas: It's a little bit hard to make a broad read. But we were encouraged by the real step-up in bolt-on activity that happened in the latter part of the year and the amount of deals that we closed at the end of the year. I wouldn't quite yet extrapolate that to the more mid- and larger-size deals, but I think an encouraging sign. Because even on bolt-on 12 months ago, they were pricier.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Larry, just I hate to bring it back to the troponin thing, but just one more, just a little bit more clarity. Are you guys actually calling out explicitly then your expectations for submission in which quarter now?
H. Lawrence Culp: No. No, I think we're just suggesting that we've got a major project that is experiencing some good encouraging progress. But again, kind of slower than we originally anticipated. So we'll keep you posted, but that's kind of what we know today.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But at least slipping off of the first quarter expectation or not even saying that yet?
H. Lawrence Culp: I've said what I've said. And again, it's one part of the puzzle. It's not a part that in any ways material financially here in 2012. We've said that I think from the outset. So that's kind of what we know today.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then the -- I know back in December you talked about the $40 million spend on molecular diagnostics sort of on a run-rate basis. I mean any visibility there about progress in that area and how we might think about some announcements over time as we progress through the year?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, I think somebody earlier suggested we were conservative. We take that as high praise. And I think when we have the opportunity to share with you what we're doing with respect to investments, we'll do that. But I think when we're talking about large and perhaps above-average risky efforts, I think we're going to be keen not to put ourselves in a box with respect to the timetables because things happen. I don't think our teams are well served by that. Frankly, I'm not convinced investors are well served either. So in this instance, we start from a blank piece of paper maybe unlike some of the other situations, and we'll keep you posted certainly as we get closer to submissions and launches. We'll let everybody know. But I think right now, we simply want to share with folks that this is a serious undertaking on the part of the company. We've removed a lot of costs at Beckman Coulter, but have done nothing to diminish or undermine our support for the molecular effort there. And obviously, we do that with an eye toward a healthy meaningful return. But at this juncture, that's probably the extent of what we're comfortable sharing publicly.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. Just gross margin, maybe one other thing that maybe easier on this front. Just could you give us a better sense of what gross margin was, x all the acquisitive dilution at the GM line?
Daniel L. Comas: Steve, if you've kind of backed out the onetime noncash charges at Beckman and kind of used a more typical fourth quarter restructuring as opposed to the $120 million we spent, that would have been about 51% versus the reported 49%.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. So pretty consistent there. And therefore as indicative of pricing that you haven't experienced deterioration on the pricing front then?
Daniel L. Comas: We have not.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, great. And the $120 million in restructuring -- and I may just have missed this, but just I know you called out the percentages in Dental and IT. But just the rest of the business, how do you end up spending it?
Daniel L. Comas: It was about -- we talked about over 200 basis point impact in IT and over 400 in Dental. It was about more like a 100 basis point or more like a 50 basis point impact in the other segments.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: In each of the other segments?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, I'll get you the precise numbers, but in that range.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: Larry, can you maybe -- it sounds like a little bit of a mixed message in emerging markets such as China, you're kind of saying sequential slowing but I think you said you expected to lead for the year. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color kind of around each of your businesses there and how you expect them to play out?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. I think what we were saying, John, was that we would expect the emerging markets to lead the developed markets again here in 2012. Certainly, if you look at the fourth quarter, China was not kind of at the top of the league table there. In fact, I think we saw our best growth in India, where we were up I think over 30% in the fourth quarter. I think with respect to the businesses in country, certainly Life Sciences & Diagnostics is the business that is exceptionally well positioned both given the clinical build-out and the research mandates coming down from the government. That's all part I think of the 12 5-year plan here we're well positioned and I saw I think a good reinforcement of that on this trip a few weeks back. I think with respect to the T&M business, again we talked earlier to some of the channel dynamics, some of the sequential slowing in TEK, but again I think the team there feels optimistic that we'll see improvement sequentially as we go through the year. In Environmental, we clearly have been wrestling with some of these municipal water projects. I think it was encouraged to see, John, that we had double-digit increase in our sales funnels at Hach Lange here early in the year compared to where we were a year ago. That bodes well. But as we learned in last year, getting those projects out of the funnel and into the order book is really a function of how funds are released by the government. And again while I think our teams are optimistic, we'll -- I suspect we'll need a little bit more time here to actually see that play out in that regard. Industrial is kind of a mixed story. The Product Identification businesses have done pretty well there and continue to do so. But our automation businesses have clearly been hit by some of the slowing build levels broadly in industrial automation, but also particularly in some of the green TEK applications, i.e., solar where they were well positioned. Dental is frankly too modest a base to talk about, but we were up significantly last year, and the team is well positioned to be up significantly again this year. The base is so modest there, and frankly they don't even care about market growth. They can just go out and compete for their fair share of the existing market. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a run around China given what we know here in January.
Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research: That's very helpful. Then if I could just follow up quickly on the Life Sciences and the Diagnostics business, as you said, you expect to be strong there. You mentioned Beckman, you said, you're encouraged by retention rates and win rates. And if you think historically Beckman, basically the way they grew, you said the retentions, wins and then also pricing on new contracts. I don't know if you'd be willing to share a little bit more specifics, when you say encouraged, how what you're seeing today kind of stacks up relative to their history?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, John, I think the short answer, if you'll allow me, is that the baselines that we established once we were in control mid-year last year really give us the best space for an apples-to-apples comparison in that regard. And again, I think if we look just at, I guess, 6 months the sequential data both with respect to retention vis-à-vis the install base and wins vis-à-vis competition, we've been heartened by the stability and some of the recent upticks in that regard. We could debate whether 6 months is an ample sample set or not, but that's what we have, and we'll continue to work that rest assured. I think that there's also frankly 2 other elements that have been part or at least can be part of the Beckman growth curve. One is a more aggressive globalization of that business. And as you know better than most, and probably a step-up in expectations in Life Sciences. That hasn't been a business that has grown for Beckman in the last several years, but there's no reason that they can't grow and certainly grow in line with the rest of the Life Science portfolio at Danaher. But we're going to push those efforts aggressively. Obviously, innovation plays an important part as we look forward to getting Beckman through the current phase that they're in and get them back fully up on their feet competing in the market and contributing to our growth and our earnings flow.
Operator: We'll go next to Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: We covered a lot of ground here. One data point I thought was interesting that was this new order first order for Trojan in the ballast water market. And this is again what we consider to be the biggest new water market opportunity in the sector. So any color regarding what this order was? Is it -- how many ships? Is this a prototype system? And how set is the technology? Do you expect this to -- you're still looking for the optimal solution?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think that, Deane, we would agree with you, this is a tremendous breakthrough opportunity in the water space. We obviously feel that with Trojan we're very well positioned. I think that we want to respect the customer confidentiality at this point and limit our disclosure to what we've said. But we're obviously encouraged because, as you know, adoption here has to start somewhere. And to be able to take the product that Marv showed many of you there at the meeting in December and now have customers beginning to write orders is very helpful to send a signal to rest of the market that Trojan's a key partner here. I think it's hard with respect to the technology to suggest that the solution that we have today is the solution that's going to exist for all-time and innovation here won't sit still. And I think as you saw, the footprint, the overall efficiency, let alone the efficacy of the product that we have at Trojan is very compelling. And as the global agreements get set, as these fleet operators begin to look at not only new installs but retrofits relative to their compliance program, we expect it to be a very significant contribution to Trojan and the water group going forward.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just to clarify, these orders or this order is all coming in prior to the international standards having been fully adopted, is that right?
H. Lawrence Culp: That's right. But I think any good operator is going to look at the trend here and recognize that they are well served to anticipate what is highly likely now as they think through again both new construction outfitting as well as their retrofit maintenance schedules.
Operator: All right. And I apologize that due to time constraints, we are to take no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. McGrew for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Trish, and thank you everybody for joining us. We're -- Dan and I are around pretty much all afternoon for any follow-ups.
Operator: And we'll conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report an outstanding third quarter result for Danaher. The quarter largely played out in line with expectations, the expectations we shared with you both in July and when we were together with many of your in early September.  Our core growth in the third quarter was 7.5%. While we are cognizant of the macro concerns, we continue to feel good about where we are today.  The Danaher business system continues to be a competitive advantage, helping our businesses capture market share through innovation, new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives. We had a number of exciting new product introductions in the quarter, most notably at Tektronix where we launched 2 game-changing oscilloscopes, which I'll talk about more later. From a geographic perspective, what we've seen thus far is again very much in line with what we saw in the second quarter: The emerging markets leading the way followed by the developed markets. While China remains healthy, third quarter revenue grew at a slower rate than what we saw in the first half. Those of you who did join us last month in Chicago saw our numerous examples of how we're building our premier global enterprise by investing in go-to-market initiatives in country leadership and localization of products in the emerging markets.  Sales from the emerging markets grew at a low double-digit rate in the third quarter, and this was the first quarter in which we surpassed $1 billion in total revenue. Sales from the developed markets grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter with the U.S. doing better than Europe.  During the quarter, we delivered strong operational performance with our core operating margin improving 130 basis points year-over-year and 4 of our 5 segments delivering over 100 basis points of core margin improvement, all the while continuing to invest in growth opportunities. We were particularly pleased with the operating margin performance at Dental and Test & Measurement, as well as the better-than-expected operating margins at Beckman Coulter.  So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.73, representing a record third quarter for Danaher and a 26% increase as compared to our adjusted EPS last year.  Revenues for the quarter increased 46% to a record $4.5 billion, with core revenues up 7.5%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 3.5%, and acquisitions contributed 35%. Our year-over-year gross margin for the third quarter decreased 330 basis points to 48.8%, while our operating margin in the third quarter decreased 340 basis points year-over-year to 14.5%. These decreases were primarily due to lower margins at Beckman Coulter and the impact of noncash acquisition-related costs related to Beckman Coulter, partially offset by leverage from greater sales volumes and some early productivity improvements. Our gross margin in the quarter, excluding the impact of the noncash acquisition-related costs for Beckman, was 50.9%.  DBS continues to drive outstanding cash flow performance. Our operating cash flows from continuing operations for the first 9 months of 2011 were $1.9 billion, a 28% increase compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date, free cash flow from continuing operations was over $1.6 billion. And our free cash flow from the continuing operations to net income ratio was a healthy 120%. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by over $600 million and expect that free cash flow will exceed $2 billion in 2011, which would be a first, again, for Danaher.  During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 2 smaller businesses with aggregate annual revenues of about $25 million to strengthen our Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. We remain optimistic about our ability to deploy capital in this environment and are encouraged by the opportunities in our acquisition funnels. So turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 23% for the quarter, with core revenues up 12.5%. T&M's core operating margin for the third quarter increased 240 basis points.  Overall, their operating margin increased 320 basis points to 24%.  Fluke core revenues grew low double digits in the quarter with solid demand in industrial, automation and calibration end markets. Emerging markets growth remained strong in the quarter, up over 20%. Fluke has been leading the DBS digital marketing effort. That work was recently recognized by the Electrical Distributor Magazine as the best of the best in the digital marketing campaign category for the company's online promotion for its iFlex clamp meter. This is a great example of DBS using the web to build brand awareness and preference to help drive growth.  At Tektronix, core revenues were up mid-single digits led by demand for our oscilloscopes, which saw greater than 20% growth in the quarter. During the quarter, we launched 2 significant new products, the MBO4000 is the world's first mixed domain oscilloscope, which delivers the functionality of both an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer in a single instrument. The mixed domain allows engineers to see time-correlated analog, digital and wireless signals at the same time, deriving quantum gains in test productivity. We also launched the 70000 D Series oscilloscope with an industry-leading combination of 33 gigahertz bandwidth and 100 gigasamples per second. This groundbreaking new product provides the industry's highest level of measurement, accuracy for today's fastest electrical signals across multiple channels.  Core revenues from our communications businesses grew over 20%, led by healthy demand for our network management solutions in North America and our network security and analysis solutions globally. The strong third quarter growth also benefited from some earlier-than-expected installations of new systems on customer networks, which will, in turn, negatively impact fourth quarter results. During the quarter, Tektronix acquired Optametra, a provider of fiber optical test systems used in telecommunications and applications.  Environmental segment revenues increased 8.5% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 4.5%. The segment operating -- core operating margin was up 35 basis points in the quarter with overall operating margin increasing 50 basis points to 21.6%.  Water quality core revenues increased at a high single-digit rate. At Hach Lange, the demand continues to be healthy for our core lab instrumentation, particularly in North America and Western Europe. The North American and Western Europe municipal business grew at a solid mid- single-digit rate in the quarter. However, muni growth in China, while positive, continues to be at lower levels than in prior years, and this is first year of China's 12th 5-year plan. Trojan core revenues increased at a low teens rate in the quarter, driven by growth in all major geographies. Large municipal-based UV systems employing Trojan's new Solo Lamp technology will be delivered over the coming months to Vancouver, Canada for a drinking water application and Melbourne, Australia, for a water reuse application. Both of these municipalities selected Trojan's technology in part to take advantage of the sustainable features, including reduced power consumption, a smaller footprint and lower carbon generation than competitive products.  Since the introduction of the new Trojan Solo Lamp technology, over $100 million of new opportunities from around the world have been quoted with market interest being particularly high in the North American wastewater market as plants consider replacing their existing chemical disinfection systems with Trojan's new product. ChemTreat's core revenue grow at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth as they continue to aggressively invest in sales activities and grab market share throughout North America.  Gilbarco Veeder-Root's third quarter core revenues increased slightly. We continue to see healthy demand for dispensers in North America and Europe and double-digit growth at Veeder-Root, offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison resulting from enhanced industry payment security standard in 2010. During the quarter, we expanded GVR's global footprint with the acquisition of Stratema, a manufacturer and distributor of dispensers in São Paulo, Brazil. Stratema strengthens GVR's position in Brazil by providing them with manufacturing and service capabilities and localized products for the Brazilian market. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 180%. As a reminder, Beckman Coulter's operations are reported in this segment and contributed to overall revenue growth, but are not yet considered core. Core revenues were up 6% in the segment for the quarter. Our core operating margin was up 120 basis points in the third quarter. Overall, our operating margin decreased 900 basis points from the prior year to 3.3% as a result of lower operating margins at Beckman Coulter, due partially to restructuring and integration activities as well as noncash charges related to fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue. We expect these adjustments will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. Radiometer's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by continued success for our ABL90 and ABL80 blood gas analyzers and consumables across all major geographies with particular strength in China. The rollout of AQT continues to go well with year-to-date revenues doubling the prior year. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. We saw strength across all major geographies, which was led by demand for our advanced staining instruments and consumables, which grew in excess of 20% in the quarter. Leica Microsystems' core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter in most major geographies, driven by continued strong sales of confocal microscopes used for research applications. Core revenues at AB SCIEX grew at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, driven by continued momentum from our TripleTOF 5600 and from the new products launched at ASMS, including new food testing and clinical research solutions. Demand was broad based with academic, applied and research markets all growing in excess of 10%. We've now owned Beckman Coulter for just over 3 months and have completed our first full quarter of integration. As we have mentioned before, there's still a lot of work ahead of us, but we are genuinely excited about where the business is today. The leadership team is fully engaged in driving improvements on all fronts, including sustainable quality improvements. We remain very comfortable with both the financial and strategic opportunities inherent at Beckman Coulter. Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 11% in the quarter, with core revenues up 4.5%. Our core operating margin was up 200 basis points in the third quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 160 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%. KaVo core revenues increased in a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter with solid demand for instruments in North America and Europe. Customer feedback on our recently introduced 3-in-1 digital imaging system for TD Panametrics [ph], Supplametrix [ph] and 3D imaging continues to be very positive. In addition to the solid organic growth, core operating margins were up meaningfully both in year-over-year and sequentially, and we continue to execute on the structuring activities and invest in go-to-market programs. Sybron core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, led by sales of our Damon Clear orthodontic solutions, infection prevention products and general dentistry consumables across all major geographies.  Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues increased 21.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 9.5%. Our core operating margin increased 130 basis points in the third quarter. Overall, our operating margin was 21.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to the same period last year. Product identification core revenues were up high single digits in the quarter, with broad-based growth across most major product categories and geographies.  During the quarter, Linx launched the CJ400, a self-service portable continuous inkjet printer designed for easy movement across multiple production lines. Customer response for this new product at PACK EXPO in Las Vegas earlier this month was extremely positive. While it's still early, we've been very pleased with the customer and associate feedback we have perceived to date at EskoArtwork. Our initial operating and strategic reviews have been very positive, and we look forward to sharing future successes with you in the coming months. In motion, core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate. The momentum we experienced in the first half of the year has slowed, particularly in the industrial automation, technology and solar markets. However, demand for Kollmorgen's engineering solutions and Thomson's linear and mechanical products remains healthy. So to wrap up, Danaher clearly had a very good third quarter. We're excited to have Beckman on board, and the integration remains very much on track. We were particularly pleased with our team's execution across the Danaher portfolio. We're certainly mindful of the environment that's likely to get more challenging as we go forward. Given our strong performance to date, we're in a position and believe it prudent to accelerate further our structural cost reductions during the fourth quarter.  As a result, we anticipate increasing of our previously announced fourth quarter quiet restructuring efforts from $50 million to approximately $100 million. This excludes the ongoing restructuring efforts at Beckman.  Our focus on gaining market share while also accelerating cost actions in a slowing macro environment, coupled with a potential more attractive acquisition marketplace, positions us well for the balance of 2011 and beyond. We are increasing our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance from continuing operations from a previous range of $2.75 to $2.82 to a new range of $2.79 to $2.84, which includes both the $100 million of fourth quarter restructuring, as well as the ongoing Beckman restructuring efforts. Our fourth quarter 2011 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations guidance is now $0.75 to $0.80.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Dave, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: What's the core growth for the fourth quarter?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, I think the guidance that we just shared you would assume mid-single-digit core growth, call it 4%, 5%.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, obviously, you're upping the restructuring. I think one of your higher-quality competitors in Europe also talking about incremental restructuring today. Do you worry that you're pulling the trigger here too soon given what we're seeing out there? Obviously, there's a lot of macro crosscurrents, but the micro for most seems to be somewhat holding in. How convinced are you that you kind of need to do this in the fourth quarter? And then, kind of how does this -- if you're growing 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter, how does this kind of play out into kind of early next year? Are there comp issues where that accelerates, or is that kind of a good way to think about the ongoing kind of is that more of trend line rate in the medium term?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I think we'll speak to the top line outlook for 2012 when we get everybody together in December. We've just literally kicked off our budgeting process, having wrapped up our annual strategic reviews with the businesses. Steve, I would say that first off, we come to the fourth quarter restructuring with a view that it's always time to take out costs that you don't need. I think we're pleased with the performance thus far. I think -- and the momentum we have going in the fourth quarter, that gives us the opportunity and ability to go after the programs inherent in the $100 million of spend. So that's going to be split roughly 50-50 between the U.S. and Europe. Dental's going to get a big chunk of that, as well the Industrial businesses, both at motion and PID as well as in T&M. So it's a broad-based effort, both by business and by geography, I think, very characteristic of the way we always operate. Clearly, we're seeing some moderation in the economy. We all read the headlines. It certainly is prudent at any time in the cycle. But I think our view is, particularly so right now given the uncertainties around 2012, better to be prepared and ready for what may come than to postpone what we think is a very prudent action here.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just one more question. In September, where did you see -- if you did see deceleration, which sounds like a little bit towards the end of the quarter, maybe a little bit of deceleration, what was kind of the -- what was the worst business from a deceleration perspective? And did you have any businesses that were negative?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, I would say that if you look at the third quarter, I think what we were particularly pleased with is that it was steady pretty much start to finish in that regard. We didn't see a dramatic tail off in September in the -- with all the headlines out there and whatnot. Clearly, we had some businesses that had, I think, just gangbuster quarters. AB SCIEX being one, ChemTreat another, looks like PID did well here again. But clearly, I think what we saw in the businesses works [ph] pretty well with what others are saying. You mentioned one competitor in Europe here this morning, I think the last several weeks in the papers relative to China still growing nicely, but at a slower rate. We clearly saw certain of our technology end markets that we serve both at motion and Tektronix soften up a bit. And I'd say in the industrial world, particularly with some of our OEM exposure at Kollmorgen, softened up. Now there's some overlap there between both China, frankly, and some of the end markets, but those are probably the 3 pools with some overlap where we saw slowing through the quarter.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And that's mostly tech, not industrial automation, right?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, when we say technology end markets, we'll feel some of that at Tektronix and we'll feel some of that particularly at Kollmorgen where we serve those end markets from the OEM side, not the test bench side as we do at Tektronix.
Operator: And next we'll go to Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You've had 3 months of time to dig into what's going on at Beckman. I mean, where is your view now versus where it was 3 months ago? I mean is the opportunity bigger, is it less, is it the same? I mean, is there any kind of change in what you think you can get out of it?
H. Lawrence Culp: Scott, I would say that 3 months in here, we've been pleased by the absence of surprises on both sides of the ledger. I'd say at 90 days in, we're very pleased with the performance of the business. I think the integration has gone very well. And we're really having, I think, significant impact on the way we run the business. You look at just the third quarter performance, top line very much in line with expectations, so no surprise there. Margins came in a little bit better than we expected. They were up about 100 basis points sequentially. Some of that is the faster traction I think we've gotten on the headcount reductions. A little bit more disciplined on the G&A spend. And on the cash flow side, we said we'd get after working cap and CapEx. That's happening, so good early results in that regard. I think with respect to the integration, that is going well. We had an excellent reception there throughout the organization, and they are rapidly adopting DBS. I think we've kind of split the company largely into 3 discrete businesses: The diagnostics business being one, the molecular effort being a second and the life science area being a third. The public company costs are out now. Tom Joyce, one of EVPs, has got overall leadership and partnership with Bob Hurley there, so that is setup, I think, just as we had intended. From a talent perspective, there's a lot of good talent there. We knew that to be true and they're showing us their capability. We put in now 10 full-time Danaher folks in senior roles, including the CFO spot, the head of operations, the head of service and as well as the head of marketing in addition to a chief transition officer. We've actually been pleased with the response we've gotten inside the industry. We're getting a lot of inbound inquiries about folks wanting to join the team, and we're pleased to recently announce a new head of U.S. sales who is an outstanding industry veteran. DBS team, fully deployed there with probably about 25 full-time equivalents working with the Beckman team to get DBS laid in. In terms of the way the business is changing its day-to-day cadence and rhythm, I think if you look quality, you look at growth, you look at costs, again real good progress here. I mean, obviously, quality is job one. We're being very aggressive in this regard. A lot of work to do and I think you see some of the early signs perhaps primarily where we're getting after some of the customer-facing issues. We got the sodium issue behind us now, that's closed out. I think we're progressing well with glucose and troponin. Obviously, we've gone public now with a new submission timetable for the troponin assay, looking at our first quarter 2012 filing. Feel like that's a prudent -- it's a marked timetable that we'll deliver on. Lots of work internally on quality. But as we continue to look at that work plan in the wake of a warning letter that we got out at Brea, I think we feel like we're working on the right things and making progress. Clearly, from a growth perspective, getting sodium behind us helps. Getting a 510(k) approval for lactate, I think, helps demonstrate to customers that we're making good headway here. You look at retention rates, they've been steady the last couple of quarters. We are winning in competitive situations as well. So I think that while we've got clearly some headwinds in front of us relative to the top line this year and next, there's no reason to think this isn't a mid-single-digit grower at least for us and that's before the molecular contributions kick in. And on the cost side, as you, I'm sure, pick up in the margins, we're more than 3 quarters of the way through the 1,000-person headcount reduction that we had laid out early on. That's helping us in a whole host of ways beyond just the P&L. And again continue to feel very, very comfortable about our ability to take at least $0.25 billion out of the overall cost structure. So again lots to do. Sorry to run on here a bit, but I think we're excited about the opportunity, and we'd make the same decision given the opportunity today.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Sounds complicated. But anyways, the restructuring, the $100 million that you're going to spend now, I mean how much of that is Beckman related and kind of a pull forward of you know what you need to take out in costs and now you're able -- business conditions are good enough that you can kind of afford to do it? I mean how much of that is Beckman versus just general Danaher?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes, Scott, the $100 million is all outside of Beckman. So in Q3, we spent about $50 million of restructuring on Beckman. We'll probably spend another $25 million, maybe north of $25 million on Beckman here in Q4. So our total restructuring will be probably north of $125 million in the fourth quarter.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So where is the restructuring at? Is it SCIEX? Is it TEK? I mean where is the delta, I guess, the $50 million to $100 million?
Daniel L. Comas: The $100 million is in all 5 segments. The 3 segments that are probably getting the biggest share of that would be Industrial, Test & Measurement and Dental. But they're all getting pretty healthy chunks of restructuring here.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe: Did you -- could you maybe just parse out the 7.5% organic between major territories: North America, Europe and maybe emerging markets?
Daniel L. Comas: Sure, Nigel. It played out pretty similar to Q2. Emerging markets grew low double digit. As you mentioned, China, which was growing 20% the first half of the year with kind of low teens in Q3. We actually saw faster growth in Brazil than we had -- in Latin America than we had seen in the first half. So overall, quite comparable to Q2. The U.S. was right about 5%. And Western Europe was about 2%, 2.5%, again pretty consistent with what we saw in Q2.
Nigel Coe: Okay, and then I guess I'll just follow on this. The 4% to 5% you -- that Larry threw out at 4Q, I mean how does that look by geography?
Daniel L. Comas: I'd say for all the regions, slightly less. We think we'll see a similar distribution between emerging markets being the strongest, the U.S. in the middle and Europe, the weakest. Though we're not looking for a particular outlier from those 3 at this point.
Nigel Coe: Okay, and then again just looking at 4Q, we saw some weakness -- some weakening coming through in motion and a little bit within Test & Measurement, the rest of technology verticals. But in 4Q, do you expect any of your businesses to go negative maybe, motion or perhaps KaVo?
H. Lawrence Culp: No, no. I think on the contrary, Nigel, I think if you look at mid-single digit 4% to 5% fourth quarter, I think we're going to have 4 of the 5 segments very much in that zone. I think what we would expect is, as I think Dan just alluded to, Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics to be fairly steady. We are seeing a little bit of pressure in motion and in Industrial, but I think all 4 of those are going to be in the zone. T&M's probably the outlier. They'll probably be in that low single-digit band, largely because of the timing on some of that TEK Comms projects. We are seeing again some slowing in the technology end markets and in China at Tektronix on the core instruments side of the business, but to have T&M as the outlier there is largely going to be a function of the timing at TEK Comms. Elsewhere in distribution, at Fluke for example, they continue to do very well.
Nigel Coe: Okay, that's really helpful. And then just finally, fantastic job on the delevering during the quarter. Does that change at all your timeline for coming back into the M&A market in any meaningful way?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, sure. I mean, clearly paying down over $600 million of debt in the quarter really puts us in a good position here. We think we'd probably have a $4 billion to $5 billion envelope over the next couple of years. As we've talk about, we were a little discouraged by the industrial M&A market and the prices being paid up to about May or June of this year. I think we've been encouraged that you've seen very little industrial M&A. To me that's kind of a first sign that maybe things are getting better. And I think we're going to be very well-positioned, and we're gearing back up as we speak.
Nigel Coe: Okay, and the $4 billion to $5 billion, you're still looking at $2 billion for next year?
Daniel L. Comas: Correct.
Operator: And next we have Jon Wood with Jefferies.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Larry, so SCIEX again over double -- over 10% despite you lapping the 5600 launch. Obviously, a lot of consternation out there about the government research budgets. Can you just kind of parse out what you see from an end-market perspective going forward in the SCIEX business?
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. Well, keep in mind, Jon, we're lapping the launch. We really began to ship that product in earnest in the fourth quarter of last year, but -- in fact, I was up in Toronto with the team yesterday and they've come a long way in really just a 1.5 years. I think if we look at just Life Sciences & Diagnostics more broadly, it's important to keep in mind that pro forma with Beckman, that's about $6.5 billion segment for us, right? About 25% of that is geared toward research applications. And of that, call it $1.6 billion, just under $1 billion is probably what we would frame as kind of classic academic research, government-funded sort of activity. I think if you look at size as well as some of the other businesses, be it Leica, be it Beckman, they're certainly seeing some pressure this year really as they try to comp the U.S. stimulus from a year ago. But I think, by and large, they are certainly reading all the negative outlooks that are out there, but are of the view that you if go back to say '06 to '08, when at least in the U.S. we saw flat funding, we were able to grow at a double-digit rate really by focusing on where innovation was occurring and in turn where money was being spent. So I think if you look at some of the correlation studies in microscopy, obviously stem cell, ultra high solution for Leica, for example, there are just a number of different ways in which the businesses, I think, are positioned to not be wholly dependent on the top line budget trends. And you have some dynamics -- we were talking with the SCIEX team yesterday, for example, about what's happening in Germany. Obviously, a lot still to be sorted out, but you have some countries that are decidedly taking a pro-investment stance, particularly with respect to scientific research and innovation. Well-positioned in those countries, well-positioned around those applications. So I think all in, that hopefully frames the exposure that we have, but also provides a little bit of color as to why we're going in with, I think, optimism to whatever the funding environment may be in '12 and '13 in Life Sciences.
Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right. Great. One last one, if you look within T&M, you talked about the low single digits in the fourth quarter being largely a result of the comms side. What do you expect from kind of the core Fluke and core Tektronix businesses in the fourth quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: I think Fluke we're looking kind of a mid-single-digit growth rate. TEK could be a low single-digit growth rate, but would expect the book to bill still be north of 1.
Operator: And next we'll go to John Inch with Bank of America.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: China didn't really sound like there was a lot of change. Is there anyway, Larry or Dan, to provide a little more color? Are you seeing sort of changes in terms of intentions in the part of customers? Is there a regional difference, say, between the west versus the coast, or are you just being somewhat cautious ahead of what's obviously an attempt by the government there to slow things down because of inflation?
H. Lawrence Culp: John, I think that we certainly grew at a lower rate in the third quarter than we did the first half. So I think we certainly saw the government's actions or whatever else is happening there. I think for us that was principally in some of the technology end markets that we serve, many of which that have obviously migrated heavily to China the last several years. We also had -- and again we have that exposure at Tektronix and Kollmorgen, principally. I'd say we also saw some of the municipal pressure that we've talked about through the year. They're just getting off to a very slow start in this regard relative to the 12th 5-year plan. But in that regard, we saw some, frankly, some encouraging signs. We also have some exposure primarily at Kollmorgen to some of the clean tech efforts that the government has put in place, and we saw those OEM customers slow considerably during the course of the quarter. So still, one of the best growth markets we've got. We've got excellent competitive positions there, but it is what it is. And again I think that, as you alluded to, the government is trying to manage a number of different competing objectives there. But I think long term, we want to be there to see these leadership positions continue to grow, and that's what we're going to do.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess where I'm going Larry, you would expect China to slow, not even just that the emerging markets meeting, but before then. I mean there is comparison issues and just natural trends as your base gets bigger. Over the course of the quarter, did it appear and may be based on your exit rates what you're looking at to date, has it slowed a little bit beyond expectations, or is it in line? That sort of was the context of what my question was.
H. Lawrence Culp: No. I think we're very much in line in that regard.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. That's where I was going, okay.
H. Lawrence Culp: I'm sorry.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: No, no. That's okay. Beckman, are you guys still thinking Beckman is up a little bit next year? Or is it still a little too early to tell in terms of the organic trajectory?
H. Lawrence Culp: John, I don't think we're going to change our top line outlook for Beckman today. We said that, I think, from the outset that this year and next would be challenging top line, given the issues we were inheriting and that a flattish performance is what we're expecting. And in turn, you should expect. So far we're in line with those expectations and really no reason to alter that course today.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And is Beckman in China, which is a big contributor, is that still sort of the same or has that changed at all?
H. Lawrence Culp: No, Beckman China is a high-performing business, a real growth catalyst for the company. And they continue to be, I think, very well-positioned in obviously an exceptionally important market.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Lastly, Larry, obviously there's a pretty obvious risk of a European recession, some big slowing here that's sort of reflected in the actions you were taking. Could you comment on your -- how you're sort of thinking about your playbook maybe in contrast to '08? And I don't know, maybe if you could comment sort of around how you're thinking about Dental for example and the performance then versus heading into a possible mild recession this time or perhaps some of the other businesses. I mean I think your portfolio looks a little more defensive especially with Beckman, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, certainly you bring on a $4 billion book of business that's 75% in the aftermarket, that creates a lot more ballast in the hull here if tough times are ahead. But I don't think that we would see anything like an '08, '09 collapse of the economy as we all saw just a few years ago. But I think your frame, John, is a good one, relative to the playbook that we intend to use going into next year. I mean regardless of what the macro scene ultimately is, I think you're going to see us continue to be aggressive in and around our investments to grab share, and that's both investments in technology and sales and marketing. I think you will continue to see us be equally aggressive on the cost side of things. You see that partially in the $100 million spend here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as Dan just highlighted, we're spending almost that much at Beckman this year to get that cost structure straight. And that just gives us both, I think, earnings protection, as well as frankly latitude to invest in growth -- organic growth at a time when others won't. You couple that with the, I think, positioning we're going to have both strategically, operationally and financially to be an active acquirer at a time when, all things being equal, our valuations are probably more reasonable and attractive for a strategic acquirer. I think that means we're set up for 2012. And again our crystal ball is no better than anyone else's, but I think that playbook, very similar to the playbook we had a couple of years ago, but modified given again we don't expect to see that sort of paralysis next year is going to serve us very well.
John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, in other words, it sounds like a mild recession maybe, to a degree, it might actually play a little a bit to your long-term strategic hand in terms of share gains and some other investments in M&A.
H. Lawrence Culp: John, we would never wish for a downturn, but if you go back to '08, '09, go back to '01, '02 in an odd way perhaps they have served us well.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: When you think about that $4 billion to $5 billion of additional M&A spend over the next 2 years, given how human resource constrained you probably are in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, you have acquisitions, I'm sure, throughout the pipeline everywhere in all the divisions, how confident can investors be that should the right, big, good ones come up in LS&D or the medical side of the business that you'd actually still hold those off and wait for the industrial side over the next 2 years, or is it kind of -- could it come out more balanced?
H. Lawrence Culp: Steve, I think what we've said in the past is obviously we've got our hands full at Beckman Coulter. Again pleased with where we are 90 days in. But investors should expect us, all things being equal, to deploy that capital elsewhere in the portfolio. And if you look at T&M, you look at Environmental, a couple of things in Industrial, could be interesting particularly around product ID. I think that Dan and I this morning don't talk about that $4 billion to $5 billion envelope without conviction that those opportunities exist. We can get at those investments in ways that I think will generate real returns for shareholders. So I don't think there's any change in that regard. And again as I think Dan alluded to, the better valuations in the industrial world, at least today and going forward, than maybe we'd seen in the last couple of years are certainly conducive to the effort that we intend to lay in T&M, Environmental and Industrial.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And you didn't mention Dental there. I take it intentionally, would that fall into the same category as Life Sciences even though you don't have as much acquisition work going on there?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I think that Dental, again a hyper fragmented market by and large. Don't be surprised if we do small thing here or there, but in terms of big bets, I think they're going to be elsewhere.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a couple of follow-ups. One the capacity -- sorry, the comments on $100 million restructuring spend, just to be clear, is any of that being directed at capacity reduction as well? I don't mean sort of shifting footprints. I assume you're getting more productivity out of other areas I mean -- or should we think about you're taking capacity out? Net capacity out?
Daniel L. Comas: I think we're making structural costs out. We don't view it as capacity. And these are basically projects that would've been in -- that were in the 2012 budget that we're starting to go through. And I think given the progress we have with the Beckman margin, the very strong core margins we had in Q3, we just felt we sort of had the room to kind of pull it forward and get it done here.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then finally on price/cost, could you give us some flavor in terms of how that dynamic progressed through the quarter across the businesses maybe?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, it hits us both in industrial. We got about 20 basis more price this quarter versus Q2. Clearly, there's been a fair amount of inflation probably through the -- probably the end of July. We've seen some of that subside obviously in spot rates, but we haven't really seen that benefit yet across the businesses. Hopefully in Q4, there's often a lag. You bring inventory in and then run it through the P&L. So it's a net and that was probably a slight negative in the quarter, the price/cost dynamics. Hopefully, that may be a slight positive for us. But again given our business mix, it's not a huge issue overall for our P&L.
Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Right. So there'll be a marginal potential upside to the fourth quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: Yes.
Operator: And next we'll go to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So on Beckman, just I guess an update on -- I mean you still thinking the $0.05 of accretion in the fourth quarter and where are you thinking about next year and maybe just give us a sense of kind of milestones that we should be thinking about?
Daniel L. Comas: Shannon, just maybe briefly on the accretion. Clearly, we trended better in the margins through the third quarter than we had forecasted at the beginning of the summer. I think that puts us in a position where there's probably a couple more cents of accretion in Beckman in Q4. We're taking some of that and putting that back into that $50 million of incremental restructuring. I think we'll avoid sort of updating any '12 numbers until December. I don't know if you want to talk about additional milestones, Larry or...
H. Lawrence Culp: Shannon, any particular area of the business that you're thinking about with these milestones?
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Well, I mean you mentioned some of the, I guess, some of the FDA already. I guess maybe from an organizational standpoint on the cost side of things, obviously, you've got 3/4 of the 1,000 done, I mean what sort of comes next?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, I mean from an organizational perspective, obviously, we have the remaining quarter for 250 people that we need to transition or will be transitioning out here in the fourth quarter. So obviously, a new structure. You have a reconstituted leadership team with Beckman veterans and some Danaher folks and again with some industry experience being brought in as well. Obviously, with nearly 10% of the headcount reduced, that changes a lot in the organization. So I think what you're going to see -- well, you're not going to see a lot of this. It will be happening inside the business. That new structure, that new leadership team, the new organization is really going to begin to again work more like a Danaher business than perhaps they have in the past. To Scott's question earlier, I alluded to some the progress that we're making with respect to quantity and growth, very much the focus here. And that's just daily work. That's what we do in transforming and building businesses. We're thrilled with the progress. Obviously from a quality perspective, there will be some things that you'll be able to see from the outside in terms of some of these public customer-facing issues. Again I mentioned some of the product recalls that have been widely publicized. We've got one of those behind us. We're making good progress on the other 2 and are obviously keen to have all 3 remediated in the not-too-distant future. Obviously, there's a lot more to the quantity challenge at Beckman. I think that presented itself in the warning letter. But again to reiterate, we really didn't find that there was new news in the wake of that FDA audit. The work that the company had disclosed previously, the progress that they've made, all of that combined, I think gives us a conviction that we will not only fix the issues of the past, but ultimately make quality a competitive advantage for Beckman Coulter.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then on dental, one of the real weak spots, I think, last quarter and a sharp recovery, maybe talk a little bit about what got done and then -- but yet it's still a focused area for restructuring. So what still needs to happen?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, clearly, we've talked about dental in the past as a business that ought to be a 15% to 20% segment OP performer, very much in line with some of the other segments. Shannon, it's a long list of different items that constitute what they'll do here in the fourth quarter. There will be, obviously, as Dan was alluding to earlier, some structural costs that comes out. That will be fairly well balanced between what we do here and what we do in Europe. And as we go through the quarter, I think we'll be able to give you a little bit more color as to some of the specifics. But again pleased with what they've done this year, certainly you saw that present itself in the third quarter. And we continue to have tremendous conviction that the Dental segment can and will be an in-line contributor at Danaher.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Larry or Dan, can you give us Beckman's actual pro forma core revenue growth in the quarter and some color how it's split between equipment and consumables?
H. Lawrence Culp: Jeff, it was again basically a flattish performance at Beckman on the top line. And I would characterize that as fairly well balanced between the split between the 2.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in muni markets both in the U.S. and Europe?
H. Lawrence Culp: Yes, I think if you look across where we have that muni exposure, it's been steady in both places. I think as we -- and we're certainly having a very good year at Trojan in that regard, I think on both sides of the Atlantic, again very much in line with the headlines. The teams are maybe a bit cautious thinking about next year, particularly with some of the bigger ticket products. But be it on the drinking water side or on the wastewater side, I think we saw good growth here in the third quarter, expect to do same in the fourth quarter and see no reason why that -- I was going to say same in that [ph] platform isn't a grower for us next year.
Daniel L. Comas: But again we alluded to the more significant muni softness has been in China, but what's in Europe and U.S. is held in pretty nicely.
H. Lawrence Culp: And the signs in China again are encouraging as we get towards the end of the year here, that is, slow start to this new 5-year plan is perhaps fading a bit on us, which will be welcome.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Do you actually see, Larry, any sign from this kind of the chatter or people you talk to over there that the foot starts coming off, the break from a credit standpoint or other kind of economy cooling types of initiatives that it had in place?
H. Lawrence Culp: I have heard that from a number of people who have, I think, thoughtful perspective on China. The exact timing and the magnitude is a bit perhaps a bit of a guessing game. But yes, I have heard that.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And then finally, just on tax, Dan, how much more of these type of opportunities do you think you have? And it looks like they're starting to push down your structural tax rate even a little bit lower. As we roll into next year, should we think that the underlying structural tax rate it's still kind of on a southward trajectory here?
Daniel L. Comas: Well, I think it appeared that with Beckman coming in it's probably taking our effective rate down maybe about 100 basis points from 25 and change to 24 and change. Absent any changes out there, whether it's U.S. or internationally, I think we're probably in that zone probably in that sort of 24%, 25% rate, which is below obviously what we're kind of running at the first half of the year.
Operator: Our final question will come from Deane Dray from Citi Investment Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on the comments earlier about the opportunity in network security analysis. And it seems like every day there's another part of a security breach or hacking or so forth, but what is the commercial opportunity both at the enterprise level, local area networks for Fluke Networks and then broader, from the carriers with TEK Communications?
H. Lawrence Culp: Dean, as you just highlighted, we see a breadth of opportunities both on our Tektronix Communications and our Fluke Networks and Arbor brands that plug in to both the physical security challenges that are out there for network operators, both on the enterprise and the carrier -- more on the enterprise side. But also in terms of some of these so-called hacking or cyber security threats. Clearly, we acquired Arbor for TEK Communications to give them an outstanding position in that application with the carriers. That business has been probably one of the top 3 growers for Danaher this year. They continue to be just choc-full of opportunity in their sales funnel and we expect them to have a very strong run here going forward. That's not the only play in and around TEK Communications. Obviously, much of what we do in the network management space is akin to what Arbor does most directly as networks tackle the challenge not only of growth, but security. Clearly, part of what we've done at Fluke Networks, particularly with a recent acquisition called AirMagnet, it improved our wireless test capability with again a strong slant there with respect to enterprise security. So that's a very hot topic that courses through all the businesses. So whether we're talking about the carriers, whether we're talking about corporate IT, we think we're well-positioned and the good growth we've seen this year is in no small part because of that exposure to cyber security broadly defined.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is this still -- do have all the right pieces to be able to address the market opportunity? You had the Arbor acquisition, but will this be homegrown from here or are there still pieces that you might need?
H. Lawrence Culp: Well, Dean, as you well know and this is a rapidly evolving space, I think we really like not only what we have today, but the R&D capabilities we have in those businesses. So it's hard for me to say that we have everything we need for all time given that we'll certainly be relying largely on our organic bets, but I wouldn't be surprised and you shouldn't either if you see us make some other inorganic bets to complement what we have currently going forward.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just last question would be on TEK Communications. What's the quote activity like on the carrier network, your next-generation systems, and any change in the competitive dynamics there?
H. Lawrence Culp: I wouldn't say we've seen any marked change there over the last 90 days, Dean. They are exceptionally busy as you can imagine given the wireless growth and the challenges that they help carriers tackle. It can be, at times, a bit of a lumpy business, but they came into the third quarter thinking they were going to have a good quarter. They had a very good quarter given the urgency certain customers had around installations. That will soften them up a bit here in the fourth quarter. But I think if you look long term, that part of TEK Communications, really perhaps in many respects the unsung hero in the Tektronix acquisition, should continue to be a strong growth contributor to Danaher.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to the presenters for any additional or closing comments.
Matt R. McGrew: Thanks, everyone. Dan and I are around all afternoon today for follow-ups.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

H. Culp: Matt, thanks. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another record quarter for Danaher. We look back here on the first half of 2011. We've gotten off to an excellent start from both the core growth and an operational perspective.  Core growth in the second quarter was 7.5%. We feel good about where we are today. Our portfolio of premier brands has never been stronger. Our businesses are performing well. We are well positioned in our certain markets, and the macro drivers propelling our growth remain intact. We continue to be encouraged by the current tone of the businesses. But given the recent economic headlines and macro data points globally, we've been paying particular attention to our leading indicators.  We grew at a mid-teens rate in the emerging markets in the quarter, with China growing more than 20%. We've always taken a long view of the emerging markets, believing that our businesses can't be leaders globally in the markets they serve without leading in the emerging markets. The developed markets grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with the U.S. a bit stronger than Europe. The Danaher Business System enables us to capture market share through innovation, new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives. AB SCIEX, Videojet, Fluke, Kollmorgen, ChemTreat, Hach, Tektronix Communications and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share from the competition. During the quarter, we delivered strong operational performance with our core operating margin improving 160 basis points year-over-year with Test & Measurement, Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Industrial Technologies all delivering over 100 basis points of improvement all the while continuing to invest in growth opportunities and restructuring-related activities for future margin expansion. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, of $0.69, representing a record second quarter for Danaher and a 28% increase as compared to our adjusted EPS last year.  Revenues for the quarter increased 15.5% to a record $3.7 billion, with core revenues up 7.5%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions more than offset the impact of de-consolidating the Apex revenues, resulting in a net 3% increase of revenues. Our year-over-year gross margin for the second quarter increased 250 basis points to 52.4%, largely due to leverage from greater sales volumes, productivity improvements and the higher gross margins of our newer businesses.  Overall, our operating margin in the second quarter increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 16.9%, with our core operating margin up 160 basis points. Included in the operating results was $14 million in equity earnings contributed by Apex. Absent the Apex contribution, our operating margin was 16.5%. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for the first half were $1.1 billion, a 26% increase compared to the first half of last year. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was over $1 billion, and our free cash flow from continuing operations to net income ratio was a healthy 121%. We are now confident free cash flow will exceed $2 billion in 2011, which would be a first for Danaher. During the quarter, we completed 3 acquisitions, including the previously announced acquisition of Beckman Coulter. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enabled us to finance the acquisition in a very cost-effective way. We are just 3 weeks into our acquisition of Beckman Coulter and we are thrilled to be bringing on this iconic franchise in the Diagnostics and Life Sciences base. We're excited to get started in the level of enthusiasm by the Beckman team and their early embrace of DBS has been outstanding. Over time, we'll strengthen Beckman's competitiveness through enhanced quality, innovation and commercial execution. We will also take full advantage of cost reduction opportunities and the strategic synergies in clinical and research applications that we see at Beckman with our Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses. So turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 24.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 9.5%. Test & Measurement's core operating margin for the second quarter increased 120 basis points. Overall, operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.4%.  Fluke core revenues grew low double digits in the quarter, with solid demand for our industrial products, including our 190 Series II handheld ScopeMeter and our 810 Vibration Tester. We saw growth in all major geographies, led again by the emerging markets which grew in excess of 30% during the quarter. We are confident that Fluke is outperforming the market. At Tektronix, core revenues were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with orders up low double digits. Sales of oscilloscopes and video test equipment were particularly robust in the emerging markets. TEK continues to invest in innovation and in the second half of this year, we'll introduce a new category of mid-range oscilloscopes to address evolving industry and engineering challenges.  Additionally, the introduction of a new oscilloscope capable of greater than 30 gigahertz bandwidth across multiple channels will further enhance our product scope performance portfolio and will help meet electronic designer's needs for more accurate characterization of high-speed serial data beyond currently available platforms. Core revenues from our communications businesses grew to mid-teens rate, led by healthy demand for our network management solutions in North America. We continue to see good momentum from our LTE offering as evidenced by several significant new customer wins during the quarter.  We've launched a series of new products across the businesses during the quarter, including Fluke Networks' OptiView XG network analysis tablet designed for automated network and application analysis in the deployment and troubleshooting of new technologies, as well as Arbor Networks' Pravail Availability Protection System designed to ensure application availability for data centers and in cloud computing. Environmental segment revenues increased 5% in the quarter, with core revenues declining 0.5%. Despite essentially flat core growth and continued growth investments, the segment core operating margin was up 20 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 21.7%. Water quality core revenues increased at a high single digit rate. And Hach Lange, the demand continued to be healthy for core lab instrumentation, particularly for industrial applications. During the quarter, we did see a slowdown in demand from our municipal customers, though overall municipal growth was still positive. On a positive note, we were encouraged by Hach's strong order book that saw orders improving sequentially each month through the quarter.  Trojan core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, driven by robust growth in industrial applications, particularly in the emerging markets. Those of you who were with us in December will recall Jon Clark's presentation on the $1 billion ballast water opportunity, which would require cargo ships to monitor and disinfect ballast water prior to discharge at port. Currently, 28 countries representing 25% of the world's deadweight tonnage have ratified the agreement and full ratification is widely expected to occur this year. Trojan's land and ship-based testing program is underway and we're starting to see order activity there. ChemTreat's core revenues grew low double digits in the quarter, their third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth with particularly solid demand from industrial customers in boiler applications. During the quarter, we expanded our Water Quality Group with the acquisition of ADCON Telemetry, a leader in low power wireless telemetry systems for environmental monitoring and in drinking in wastewater operations. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's second quarter core revenues decreased at a low double digit rate due largely to difficult year-over-year comparisons, resulting from enhanced industry security standards last year. We continue to see strong demand for dispensers in North America and Europe and continued double-digit growth at Veeder-Root. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 30.5%, with core revenues up 8%. Our core operating margin was up 390 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin decreased 110 basis points from the prior year to 4.9%, primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter, driven by continued success over ABL90 and ABL80 blood gas analyzers and consumables across all major geographies with particular strength in Europe, China and Japan. The rollout of AQT is progressing well with over 25 units placed in emerging markets alone during the quarter.  Leica Biosystems' core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, driven primarily by healthy demand for our core histology systems in China, Japan and North America. During the quarter, we equipped the University of Southern California's new outreach lab with a complete histology system, including BOND-III advanced stainers, core histology instruments, reagents for both advanced and core staining and our first Cerebro sample tracking system to help their lab identify and track patient samples through the histology workflow. With this placement, USC will now serve as a key reference site for Cerebro here in the U.S. Leica Microsystems' core revenues grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, driven by strong sales for confocal and surgical microscopes in China and Latin America.  Core revenues at AB SCIEX grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Demand was broad-based with research, applied and pharma markets, all growing in excess of 10%. We continue to be very pleased with the tremendous success of TripleTOF 5600, which has exceeded expectations, and more importantly, is making a significant impact in the market with customers.  At the ASMS show in May, we had over 20 scientists, including many key opinion leaders to present their results at AB SCIEX's user meeting, which speaks to the impact the technology is having on the scientific community. At ASMS as well, we launched SelexION, an innovative differential ion mobility spectrometry technology quantitative and qualitative analysis for use on the QTRAP 5500 and the TripleTOF 5600 to improve data quality and accelerate sample preparation.  As we mentioned at the outset, during the quarter we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Beckman Coulter. While it's still early, we have been pleased with the customer and associate feedback we have received thus far. Our initial operating reviews have been positive and we look forward to sharing further successes with you in the coming months. Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 18% in the second quarter with core revenues up 6.5%. Our core operating margin was up 25 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 10 basis points from the prior period to 10.9%.  KaVo core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. Our imaging products have grown low double digit thus far this year, due in part to the continued success of the DEXIS Platinum intra-oral sensor and our recently introduced OP300 hybrid digital imaging system. Demand in North America was robust in the quarter and we continue to build momentum in the emerging markets where KaVo and Sybron are collaborating more intently and investing together in go-to-market initiatives. Sybron core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter, led by orthodontic solution and infection prevention products in North America and the emerging markets generally, as well as the absence of inventory de-stocking that occurred in the prior year period. Customer response to Kerr's recently launched composite filling system, SonicFill, continues to be very positive, helping drive high teens core growth in general dentistry consumables. So moving on Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 32% for the quarter with core revenues up 14.5%. Our core operating margin increased 190 basis points in the second quarter. Overall, our operating margin was 21.7%, a 100 basis point increase compared to the same period last year. Product Identification core revenues were up low double digits in the quarter, with broad-based growth across all major geographies and product categories. Demand from electronics customers for our parts marking systems was again strong this quarter and we believe we continue to capture market share. During the quarter, we also launched the 1610 DH, a dual head version of our 1000 series CIJ printer. This high-speed continuous inject printer is designed for applications requiring printing in 2 locations on the same product or on multiple lanes of a web application and is ideal for food and beverage, pharmaceutical and building material applications. While still early, we've been pleased with the customer feedback with this new product. Our Motion businesses' core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. The momentum we saw late last year and earlier this year continued as we experienced significant growth in all major geographies and markets. Kollmorgen's AKM and AKD motors and drives continues to capture share and we are on track to double AKD drive revenues this year compared to 2010. So to wrap up, a good start to 2011. We're obviously excited to have Beckman on board and from what we've seen thus far, DBS is going to have high impact at Beckman and that gives us a lot of confidence, not only to tackle the challenges in the business, but also in our ability to take advantage of both the growth and cost reduction opportunities.  Our business has continued to perform very much in line with expectations that we laid out in December. With DBS, we have the potential to drive organic growth and margin expansion and with our increased exposure to higher growth emerging markets, we believe we are well positioned to continue to outperform with the remainder of 2011 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $0.66 to $0.71. We are increasing our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from the prior range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.82. The new full year range includes approximately $0.05 of accretion related to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: So glad to see Beckman Coulter finally in the fold. And I want to actually though lead off with a couple of questions on just the overall impact that you're seeing on the macro basis from the China deceleration and other emerging market concerns overall across the business. I know you mentioned you were up 20%, but are you seeing any signs of weakness at all?
H. Culp: Well, I think you see signs of weakness all the time, Steve, but having been with the China and India teams earlier this week, albeit telephonically, I would characterize the general tone and outlook is quite buoyant, and we clearly are working to get some very tough comps. I mean, we've seen some signs in China, for example, of a slow start in a couple of businesses, water being one, on account of the timing around the 5-year plan, maybe a bit more so than the tightening. I think some of our businesses are on the outlook for signs of credit tightening, where they deal with that smaller customers. But by and large, I think their mood was quite upbeat with respect to second half. India is obviously dealing with a couple of different issues. But I'd say by and large, we expect a little of the froth to come off, but still think as we look at the third quarter and certainly the second half, the emerging markets will lead the way.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay, all right. Well, it's always hard to reconcile that with some of the deceleration in the government's action in interest rate. But okay, that's good to hear. Just on the growth within Environmental that the negative 0.5%, I mean, obviously that's all -- it looks from Gilbarco Veeder-Root. Are you expecting that to turnaround or what should we expect going forward there?
H. Culp: Yes. Steve, I think that, that's exactly right, just to make sure we're all in the same page. We certainly saw Gilbarco play out in the first half, very much as we would have anticipated, in large part, because of the tough comps on the payment schemes here in the first half. That obviously gets easier for us as the year goes on, and we would expect them to be more of a contributor here as we go forward. As we talk about your conference, not that long ago, obviously, we've also seen a little bit of pressure in the muni world at Hach Lange, and to a lesser degree, Trojan. So we're watching that carefully. But as we look at the third quarter, I think that when we talk about the guidance for the quarter, I think the Environmental segment won't be leading the way here. And we talk about our growth guidance for the quarter or for the second half being in that 6% to 8% range, as we've talked, I suspect Environmental will probably be south of that midpoint, but specifically, I think on the GVR we'll begin to improve from here.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: And are you expecting additional acquisition-related transaction costs from Beckman, or are we finished in the numbers you took this quarter?
Daniel Comas: Steve, we will have about $0.14 or $0.15 a share in the second half, primarily related to inventory step-up and deferred revenues. So of that $0.15 that we'll call out in the second half, probably 85%, 90% of that will be noncash in nature. There will be a little bit of cash cost to take out the Beckman bonds here in the third quarter, and we expect to be done with all that by the end of the year.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: It sounds like we're getting closer to the time to revenue on this ballast water opportunity and it does sound like it could be a big deal for an extended period, and I've seen much higher estimates for that $1 billion. I know that's the addressable market but -- for Danaher, but if you just take us through what you think the gating factors are. From my understanding, it's the coast -- U.S. Coast Guard has to ratify it. That's considered to be the more stringent standards. And then from a technology standpoint, it sounds like Trojan has to partner with someone and just give us a sense of where you are in terms of what product will be assembled and available for -- on these ships?
H. Culp: Sure. Well, I think the -- from a regulatory point of view, this is a global initiative. It's not a U.S. effort, as I know you know Deane, and I think that our read of the political landscape, and I don't think we necessarily have a unique perspective here is that the global agreement will come into force here this year as the folks that aren't yet on board are indeed that signed up. I think that will really trigger this market in earnest. In anticipation of that, as you've indicated, we have been investing heavily at Trojan to really take their disinfection technologies, which they deploy in a whole host of, if you will, land-based applications, primarily it's waste and drinking water treatment facilities, but also in industrial and commercial applications to these cargo ships to basically help them disinfect the water used as ballast before it's dumped at port. That I think is a product capability that we have. We can, by and large, do that ourselves, but obviously, we don't really have a shipboard capability. So we're partnering there, Deane, really from a sales and service perspective to make sure that the technology and the packaging we have is well deployed and obviously a very new vertical for us. So as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're in the process of a rigorous test protocol for this disinfection equipment that occurs both on land and in situ on board ships. The order book is beginning to percolate here. I really don't think this is a needle mover for us with respect to revenue in 2011, but I suspect by the time you see more, let's say, at year end, we'll be talking about 2012 revenue and we're going to stick to that $1 billion band. That's a big number. And it's still very early in this regard, but again, obviously flagging it here, we're very optimistic about this being a meaningful growth driver for Trojan and for the Environmental segment going forward.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great. And just as a follow-up and also still in the water sector, you called out some softness in the municipal side and I know this was something discussed last quarter. We're not surprised to see it, but is the nature of the softness? I would trust it's not on the consumable side. Is it more new project-related delays and push-outs?
H. Culp: Yes. I think that's a fair read, particularly in the developed markets. I think that China has, obviously, been a big growth driver for us. I think the team's prediction that the new 5-year plan would cause projects to be a little unclear with respect to timing in 2011 has played out. But I think China gets better for us as we move forward, all things being equal, and who knows what's going to happen with respect to some of these municipalities given some of the political headlines of late, but still good growth. It's all relative here. A little bit of the top has come off at Hach Lange in the wake of these pressures, but they're still performing very well, and we think they will in the second half of this year.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Could you just maybe talk about the trends at Tektronix, the revenue there was a bit light relative to what I was expecting. Can you maybe talk about what's going in the order flow there for the quarter?
H. Culp: Sure, Steve. I think what we saw at TEK was a strong finish following a light start to the quarter. I think we were pleased to see, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, orders north of shipments at a double-digit rate, very encouraged by that. I think as we saw that build through the quarter and even here early in July, TEK would appear to be in good shape and obviously some of the technology end markets that we serve are showing some signs of softness. So we're watching that carefully, but I think given the book-to-bill dynamic there, given the sequential progress through the quarter and frankly, the new product introductions that we commented on that are coming to market here in the second half, we feel very good about where TEK is right now.
Daniel Comas: And Steve, I would add to that, that dynamic of orders being better than shipments was also true at Fluke and at TEK Communications as well. We had a very good order book across Test & Measurement in the second quarter.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So what was the book-to-bill at T&M?
Daniel Comas: It was -- order -- the shipment growth in Test & Measurement was 10%. Our order growth was mid-teens. That's going to be 1.04, 1.05 or something, I guess.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Maybe just a high-level question, are you guys at all thinking about contingencies? I mean, I know Danaher always has some sort of hedge and restructuring in there, but I mean have your antenna picked up anything in the last couple of months that, kind of changes the behavior of telling your managers to maybe put a little bit more of contingency in place? How are you looking at that?
H. Culp: Well, I think it's a balance right now, Steve, because, again, we had a very strong core growth quarter in the second. I think our outlook for the second half is still quite positive. So we don't want to head for the bunkers prematurely. That said, I think we're always in a mode this time of year to make sure that we're taking a sober look to second half, not only with respect to this year, but also making sure that where the structural opportunities are that those are being identified, so we can continue our quiet restructuring and we would anticipate doing that here in the second half. I think you've heard us for a while now say that we're not seeing dramatic impact from the headlines in the businesses. That's good, but we're taking nothing for granted right now, so we're watching things very carefully and the businesses now to, not only watch as leading indicators, but also to be ready in the event that a more dramatic storm comes ashore here.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then one more question, are you guys ready to do a -- do you think you have the capacity to do another, I don't know, $5 billion plus deal if something kind of comes along in the next couple of months?
H. Culp: Another $5 billion deal the next couple of months?
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Yes.
H. Culp: I think we're on record of saying our second half deal envelope is probably in the $300 million range, so that would suggest wrecking the balance sheet beyond recognition. Steve, I don't think we'll be going there any time.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. So the low end of that $5 billion range?
Daniel Comas: Yes. I think our appetites are doing a very large deal and having to issue a substantial portion of that deal with our equity. It's a very, very tough time.
Operator: Next question from Jon Wood of Jefferies.
Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So Larry, can you just comment on Beckman, the core outlook there following what you guys have seen from that business in the second quarter is a flat assumption for the year or the back half of the year for that matter still relevant? And then going to the accretion side for Dan, is that deal going to be accretive in the third quarter?
H. Culp: Jon, I would say that we were pleased with the second quarter performance at Beckman. If you kind of look at the last 2 quarters there, they've been up low single, up, call it, 2%. Obviously not where we want to be, but I think very much where we thought they would be. And that's I think -- and then you saw second quarter, we saw the second quarter in line pretty much with the last couple of quarters in that regard. So I think we're comfortable with the state of affairs there. You know that we've tried to keep expectations around revenue very modest here given that there are some other issues we need to work through, but I think as we look at the second half of '11, as we look at 2012 right now, we're right where we've been assuming a flattish revenue outlook ahead of the real impact that we're going to have on the top line by improving quality, getting past some of the regulatory challenges, making sure that we are aggressive from a competitive perspective in terms of how we get out and take care of our customers, let alone what we want to do from a new product perspective over time. So no real change, but we much prefer being here today on the other side of closing because we're able just to operate differently and build the momentum we had, albeit the planning momentum over the last 4 or 5 months.
Daniel Comas: Jon, in terms of accretion in the back half, our expectation is that all that nickel will come in the fourth quarter. We anticipate pretty substantial quiet restructuring. We don't plan to call it out in the third quarter. We will have additional restructuring and realignment cost in the fourth quarter, as well as into 2012. That's all factored in there, but we have a lot of actions we're going after as we speak. There will be a big impact of that in Q3. We think we can absorb that and have it be neutral to EPS. It would be the right thing for the business to position it and then start to be accretive in the fourth quarter.
Paul Olszewski - Management CV, Inc.: All right, great. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up on the Life Sciences & Diagnostics core business, obviously SCIEX continues to gain momentum here. Larry, can you just comment on your view qualitatively of that mid-teens number? How much of that do you think is a market share phenomenon and how much do you think is just the mass spec market, if you will?
H. Culp: Jon, I think it's a tough line to draw here in the back of obviously a couple of quarters of very good growth. I think we are encouraged by our performance with the 5600 from a new product perspective. I think there are a number of geographies, particularly North America where we're very pleased with the improved commercial execution of the organization. But clearly, as you know, as well as anyone, the market has been upbeat. Pharma has been, I think, better in the first half of this year than anyone might have anticipated, but I think that this business is doing well. We'll see where some of the other folks come in here. But I think in the first half of this year, we probably took a little bit of share in certain corners. I was up in Boston with the team yesterday. I think they are feeling very good about the response today at ASMS around some of the add-ons the 5600, feeling very good about some prospects for the second half, let alone the product, the new product development pipeline. So all in all, it's still only 18 months in, right, with SCIEX, but we really like where we are with this business.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from John Inch of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: So just so I understand the guide, you beat by $0.04 your midpoint this quarter, you're raising by -- effectively the year by all of the Beckman contribution. If there's no sort of spillover from whatever beat it in this second quarter to the rest of the year based on your positive commentary, it kind of looks like you've got the third quarter flat, right? So what sort of -- why isn't there a little bit more optimism from the second quarter reading through to the rest of the year?
H. Culp: John, I think the -- I think the headlines given what they are obviously have us tempering our thinking here, but I think all in all, as we look at the top line and the BCM here for the second half, as well as the nickel from Beckman, I think we feel very good about that guidance. Certainly, as we look at some of the things that we want to make sure we work through beyond the obvious, whether it's the muni, the muni headwinds that we talked about a moment ago. Obviously, Japan from a supply chain perspective was something we said we'd like to see through, though I think the signs there are all positive and some other items there. But I think all in all, we feel very comfortable about where we are in the second half.
Daniel Comas: And John, as you know, we like to have some latitude in the second half to pull forward some cost actions we would typically budget. We're in the process of budgeting for 2012. I think if the top line continues, you may see us some take some actions here that in otherwise would occur -- cost actions that would have otherwise occur in 2012.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Now that make sense. I'm just trying to make sure there isn't some implied message of obvious slowing in some aspects of your business, but it seems like that's not what you're suggesting at all?
H. Culp: Yes. Now again, I think we're talking about 6% to 8% core for the second half and that should be from what we see today, balanced between the third and the fourth.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Larry, what do you think the risks are that Beckman next year possibly puts up organic growth that's negative? Is that -- like is the over or under kind of equally weighted if you're looking at sort of a flattish outlook? Or do you think the balance be over sort of tips to more positive versus negative?
H. Culp: I think you've got a number of swing factors there, John, but I'd take a balanced view there given where we are, which is why I think it would show [ph]. I would say we'd take a balance view as to the over/under on that, that flattish outlook, which...
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: So in other words if it's negative, it's not going be negative by much is the point you're making?
H. Culp: That would be our current view, yes.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: What's your outlook, Larry, still for the cost side as you've kind of gotten into Beckman? And how much of the -- is there any sort of the cost synergy baked into the $0.05 this year or just more that kick in next year?
H. Culp: Well, the cost synergy efforts really works against us this year, as Dan highlighted, because we're going to be putting some of that investment into the business ahead of pulling out that $0.25 billion dollars of cost that we've talked about. I think, John, we are very confident given the planning that has been underway for many months now that we can safely reduce their cost structure by that amount and do that. And when I say safely, what I'm referring to and have that come out without impairing the business' ability to grow, to improve quality, to invest in innovation and the like. So I'm highly confident that, as we move forward, we're going to find other opportunities. I think for today, we're going to stay with that $250 million cost out number.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, now that make sense. And then just lastly, can I ask you about industrial, obviously, you sort of saw how the quarter progressed from a macro perspective, right? It looks like there had been a bit of pre-buying in March systematically and then -- I'm not talking about Danaher, I'm talking about overall economy and then May was obviously a little softer and June seems to have been a bit better. What happened within your industrial businesses, not maybe specifically defined to Industrial Tech? But just as you look at sort of your industrial production related types of businesses, what happened in the quarter and what's your outlook? I mean, the 14.5% is, obviously, very strong. So it suggest that there wasn't much of a trend, but maybe what was going on under the surface?
H. Culp: Yes. No, I think it was strong and certainly as we look at the third quarter, I'd say that Industrial Tech, the segment, probably going to be on the high end of that 6% to 8% growth range, though it certainly be above the midpoint. I think your question is -- I think properly framed, if we just look the industrial landscape, but not limited to our Industrial Tech businesses, I think what we saw whether it's the Thomson where we sell through distribution, be it the Fluke industrial business, Our POS was by and large pretty good and I think the distribution by and large was fairly upbeat. And I think as the quarter wore on, things were stable, things were solid. Where we did see I think a little bit of softness, John, was more of the OEM side of the business and that's another one of these second half areas that we're going to have to watch. Certainly at Kollmorgen we saw that and that was primarily in our technology end market. So no surprise there, but obviously something that we want to watch given the supply chains and the build rate risk factors that we would have in our limited OEM facing business.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Right. But did that sort of -- was that trend throughout the quarter or did it kind of see a blip in May and get some sort of bounce back in June? I mean, it sounds trite, but it is sort of -- people are very concerned about kind of monthly progression here, that's all.
H. Culp: Yes. No, and nobody more than me and Dan here, so we understand the question. I would say that it was a bit -- it was kind of -- it was bumpy as we went through May and June. So it's really hard to discern an exact trend and we certainly didn't see a dramatic falloff in our leading indicators, but we did see a softening order, but maybe a little softer than we would have anticipated. So again, that's why we want to make sure we're on our toes here come the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: So Larry, on the FDA issues just kind of troponin and sodium and glucose, things like that, how are you feeling about them in terms of an update and what you're thinking for the second half?
H. Culp: Well, I think that from a regulatory perspective, Shannon, we feel very good about the progress the business is making. Obviously, troponin is probably the single assay under question that gets the most attention. Certainly, plenty of work ahead of us in that regard, so no news this morning in that regard. But again, I would just remind, maybe the broader group that the regulatory challenge at Beckman Coulter is not strictly one born of 3 specific assays where they've had issues historically. It also incorporates a broader quality system effort that has been, I think, well documented and that's going to be a -- that is a significant undertaking. We're pleased with the progress that the company has made. We've had obviously a lot of visibility, not only on the plans, but the progress that we're knee-deep in that with them now. That's our #1 priority here in the short term. Obviously, it will be in the long-term as well. But I'm very encouraged by the trajectory that the Beckman team is on in that regard. But again, a lot of work to do. I think more broadly, the integration planning has gone exceptionally well, Shannon. The transition team is probably, on a full-time equivalent basis, almost 25 people strong from a Danaher view in terms of our folks spending virtually all their time at Beckman. We have made some organizational changes there. We have begun to exit the public company structure and in turn the publicly cost that go with that. We have split the business formally into 2 halves, a Diagnostics and a Life Sciences business, to provide appropriate focus around each of those businesses. We've made a few changes as a result of those 2 moves, which have included the insertion of a Danaher CFO, as well as one of our group execs as the, in essence, the Chief Transition Officer for the business. Tom Joyce continues to oversee all of this. Bob Hurley, the Beckman CEO is a full partner in that effort with Tom, and we're feeling very good about the outlook. Again, a lot of long days and weeks ahead to be sure.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Yes, good luck with that. On dental, what do you think about the margins there? I guess, as you look into the rest of the year into '12. And what's happening there from either a mix or cost standpoint as we look from this kind of 2Q run rate?
H. Culp: Right. Well, there -- they need to be much higher. Let's make no mistake about that. I think what you saw in the second quarter, Shannon, was really a function of a couple of things. Certainly, we had a -- this plant that we're taking out has impacted margins as we would have anticipated, call that quiet restructuring. We certainly have stepped up the growth spending there largely around the second half ramp for the new imaging products that I referenced, as well as in light of the traction we have the emerging markets with the collaboration between KaVo and Sybron long overdue and now well underway. And I think the third issue there was really some of the negative mix we had in certain product categories that certainly didn't help. The team understands that they ought to be a 15-plus percent OP business. They have a roadmap that they are executing in that regard and we would anticipate that nothing less from that business.
Daniel Comas: And we'd expected a meaningful sequential improvement of those operating margins Q2 to Q3 here.
H. Culp: As we saw in the second quarter, right, because they were up 100 basis points sequentially from the first.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Okay, but getting to the 15% -- getting to the 15% plus, is that going to take a little more time into next year or...
H. Culp: That won't happen this year, Shannon. Sorry, if I suggested that.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: No, you didn't. I just concluded it. I just want to make sure I was hearing it right.
H. Culp: No, I think the path to 15% plus at dental is a multi-year effort obviously more of the work resides at KaVo than it does at Sybron, but that progress continues and they need to deliver more of it, obviously, given where they are versus that target. But we're confident we'll do that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Can we just spend a little more time on understanding kind of how the FDA issues play out for you? And one element of my question is, obviously, there's substantial costs involved with kind of making this right and getting on the right track with the FDA. Is that cost push that's required fully already embedded in kind of Beckman's cost base, or is there another kind of step up that needs to happen now as you guys take the reins to really make sure this gets fixed?
H. Culp: Jeff, I would say that the effort that has been underway is a considerable one here for the better part of the year. As a result, you're certainly seeing an increase spend in RA/QA type activities across the company, but I don't think that we see a dramatic step up from here relative to what they need to do. It really is more just executing on the plan that has been laid out, that has been staffed, that has been funded over a multi-year period to make sure that we are as good as any company with respect to fulfilling our regulatory obligations, not only to regulators, but obviously in turn to our customers.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And I assume there's some significant outside help and expertise involved in doing this currently?
H. Culp: That's exactly right, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And Larry, can you give us a sense then and perhaps its embedded in the 250, but once this is set right, so to speak, I mean, the effort never ends, but once we're kind of past the fire drill, what kind of costs come back out on kind of the FDA correction?
Daniel Comas: Jeff, our planning assumption is that cost does not come out. Maybe it does, but our -- that 250 savings is not -- none of that includes the benefit of reducing their quality costs. Maybe that's conservative, but I think it's a good planning assumption.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Right, but in actuality, there is some meaningful nut there that likely comes out?
H. Culp: Jeff, I don't think that's what we're saying. I think what we're saying is we've assumed a level of spend there that takes a number of different forms that we think is important. And while a lot of that activity maybe in what you might think of is remediation mode, that will transition into maintenance mode as we move forward. So again, I think we see tremendous cost reductions at Beckman. We see strong margin expansion potential. But first things first, quality and RA/QA top that list. So we're not assuming any reductions there.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Is there anything that we should be looking at kind of from the outside looking in to gauge how this is going or should we kind of expect it just kind of comes in your regular quarterly updates of kind of the acquisition integration and the like?
H. Culp: Yes. We were -- we would anticipate, Jeff, I think using these calls to give you as much of an update as we can, as we move forward. It will be hard to report the Danaher quarter from here on out without a significant amount of time on Beckman, but we'll also obviously be talking about Beckman at different conferences and the like as part of our normal IR rounds.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Right. And just one unrelated follow-up. Product ID orders, can you give us a little color there and how that's looking into the back half?
H. Culp: I would -- as we think about the back half here again with the 6% to 8% range for core, I think we would anticipate that industrial will be above that with Product ID playing a significant role, albeit without the new acquisition Esko being in that calculation. They're off to an outstanding start by the way. So we would -- we have a strong outlook here in the second half with the ID.
Daniel Comas: I mean, Jeff, they have a lot of momentum. I mean, they did have a very, very strong second half last year. So from a reported basis, their core numbers probably aren't going to be quite as high as they were in the first half, but that doesn't really -- sequentially there's just -- so a lot of strength in the business right now.
Operator: Mark Douglass of Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: What was -- currency had a bigger impact on the top line versus expectations and probably what you were guiding. And what are you expecting for the rest of the year? And what was the impact on EPS or net income in the quarter?
Daniel Comas: Mark, I don't think we figured it in our guidance. When we issued earnings in the third week of April, the euro was 1.45 and that actually averaged a little bit less than that for the balance of the quarter. So it wasn't a surprise to us given where the euro was when we announced earnings and gave guidance in April. It obviously was a benefit of about 5%. I think it will be slightly less a couple of points here in -- maybe 3 to 4 points here in the back half, assuming the euro stays kind of in the low 1.40s, clearly there have been some volatility there, but it's in that range.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. I guess, I was thinking 2% for the year, but likely a little more than that?
Daniel Comas: Yes.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just lastly on the Fluke Networks, TEK Communications, even TEK some, things in comm at least for the equipment space service providers, it seems to have gotten more negative more recently. What is your outlook for the comm space right now going forward? Has it changed materially?
H. Culp: Well, I think what we saw in the second quarter was very encouraging. I again, as I think Dan indicated, across T&M and certainly in the comps group positive book-to-bill, good strength. Some of the comps that are out there that you maybe referring to aren't necessarily the best comps. We don't have a lot of exposure in certain verticals, typically around financial services and with the government, the federal government here in the U.S. that some other folks do. Our exposure tends to be more with the carriers certainly on the mobile side where we're seeing very strong growth at TEK Comm and much of that net is really an enterprise play where we've seen with our portfolio very good performance, and that coupled with a good emerging market exposure is why I think those businesses have fared very well relative to some other companies that maybe comps, but really aren't competitors.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Larry, can you speak to, maybe just a minute or 2, you talked a little bit about industrial, maybe orders were a little bit bumpy during the quarter. But if you look at kind of order trends and maybe tone of business in Europe specifically, across maybe IT and then also the Test & Measurement business, any discernible slowdown or change in inflection in the tone of business in Europe during the quarter?
H. Culp: I think the short answer is yes. Certainly, as we look at the geographies, emerging markets led the developed markets and the U.S. was ahead of Europe, so it was really the first time we saw that differentiated performance out of Europe. I would say, it was by and large broad-based and certainly didn't necessarily get better as the quarter wore on and the hanks and the like from the headlines grew.
Daniel Comas: Rick, I would add that the business in Europe that probably held up the best in the second quarter was Test & Measurement. But we did, as Larry alluded to, we did see some weakness in the other industrial businesses, a little bit in Med Tech as well in Europe.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And so if we think geographically and we're thinking about this core 6% to 8%, obviously emerging above that, U.S. maybe towards the 6 number and Europe stays positive in low singles, I mean, if we try to split this geographically.
Daniel Comas: I think that's about how it played out in the second quarter and it's probably not a bad sort of rough planning assumption.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then just general question, when I look at the T&M piece of the business and also the Industrial Tech piece of the business, given the very significant core growth rates that we saw in both businesses, I was a little bit curious, the incremental margin in both businesses was kind of in a 27% range, maybe a little bit below 30%. Is there a concerted effort there maybe to kick up any quiet restructuring or should that incremental have been a little bit bigger on that type of core growth?
Daniel Comas: Rick, there's a little bit of noise in both of those incrementals because of both the Keithley acquisition and one-time charges there and the recent Esko acquisition in Industrial Tech. If you look across Danaher, you don't have quite this visibility, but if you strip out acquisitions and also currency, our fall through across the businesses were close to the 40%. That was true in Test & Measurement. Now Industrial Tech was a little bit low because of Motion. We are seeing some significant inflation in areas like magnets and the rare earth issue in China where some of the magnets we're buying are literally 10x the price we paid at the beginning of the year. Now they're getting a fair amount of price, they're still doing well, their margins are consistent with where they were in the first quarter, but we're not seeing the kind of seasonal improvement we see in -- more typically see in margins. And that's really in Motion, that's not the other pieces, it's not Product ID, but that's one area where inflation is hitting us very hard.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And so the core fall through for all of Danaher or for those 2 pieces was closer to 40%?
Daniel Comas: All Danaher was closer to 40%. Test & Measurement, was right in there. Industrial Tech was lower because of the dynamic I just talked about with Motion.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints our final question for today will come from Jason Feldman of UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: So at AB SCIEX, the TripleTOF has been very successful and by all accounts it gained a fair amount of share. At ASMS, there were a couple of new product introductions from some of your competitors. Do you still see runway from a market share perspective? Or is it time to think about the next generation of products at some point in the not-too-distant future?
H. Culp: Jason, I think we see a lot of runway. We have not yet been shipping the 5600 for 4 quarters yet. So that coupled with all the KOL support and we feel good about that, but it's always time to think about the next-generation products. And again, I was up with the team. We did an R&D review yesterday. There's always -- this is always the part of a new acquisition integration that takes longer to affect, but I think we're very encouraged about what you'll see AB SCIEX rollout over the next several years by themselves, and obviously over time, you're going to see some of those synergies I referred to at the outset come into play there as well. So we're thrilled about what they've done here in the first half and just have a very upbeat outlook as we think about that business going forward.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And lastly on Beckman, I think you've been very clear from the very beginning about how that will be initially dilutive to your overall organic growth rates, and I understand that the immediate concern is the cost synergies and the integration and to focus on those issues. How long does it take do you think before you're really able to get focused to working on structurally improving their underlying core growth rate, whether it's sales synergies with other businesses or improved innovation? Is that a 2013 kind of phenomena or some other point?
H. Culp: Jason, our efforts thus far both in planning and here in the last couple of weeks with respect to execution had been focused again, first and foremost, on quality, and I'd say second on growth. So we're already spending a lot of time in a whole host of ways trying to help the top line, both in the near term and the long term. So I think what we've tried to suggest is that despite that activity, given the context of flattish revenue outlook is probably the sober frame for the rest of this year and through next year. I think our hope and intent is that come 2013 and beyond, you'll begin to see the impact of Danaher and DBS on Beckman's core growth. I think the nature of the work is just more straightforward, as Dan highlighted. You'll see that impact with respect to cost out far sooner, but that pairing, that timing of those activities is I think by and large typical and certainly appropriate for this situation.
Operator: And Mr. McGrew, at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing comments.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, everyone. Dan and I are going to be around all day for follow-ups.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin your conference.
Matt McGrew: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulations G. relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Earnings and will remain available following the call.  The audio portion of this call will be archived in the Investors section of the website later today under the heading Investor Events and will remain archived 'til our next quarterly call. The replay of this call will also be available until April 26. The replay number is (888)203-1112 in the U.S. and (719)457-0820 internationally. The confirmation code is 8183339.  During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Please refer to the accompanying slide presentation, our earnings release, our first quarter Form 10-Q and other related presentation materials supplementing today's call for additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. As announced on January 18, we reached an agreement to sell our Pacific Scientific Aerospace businesses. For the current quarter, the results of this business are reflected as discontinued operations in our statement of earnings as required by generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, our historical audited financial statements for the 3 years ended December 31, 2010, we revised to reflect this business as discontinued operations. We'll be filing these financial statements with the SEC later today under our Form 8-K. All references in these remarks and accompanying presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operation of Danaher's businesses, unless otherwise noted. I'd also like to note that we'll be making some statements during the call that may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities law including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Larry.
H. Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've gotten off to a great start in 2011, and I'm pleased to report an outstanding first quarter for Danaher.  We grew 10% organically in the first quarter, with all of our segments reporting mid single-digit growth or better. We feel very good about where the portfolio is today in terms of how our businesses are performing, how they are positioned in our served markets and the macro drivers in these markets.  Over the last several years, we've aimed many of our investments at the emerging markets, which positions us well in the fastest-growing parts of the world. Those investments are paying off as we grew nearly 20% in the emerging markets this quarter, with China and Brazil leading the way. We were also encouraged by the continued strength in the developed economies, which grew to high single-digit rate in the quarter. I want to provide a special word of thanks to our associates in Japan, who in the face of great strategy, have shown tremendous spirit and resilience.  In addition to our go-to-market initiatives, we've also been making significant investments in innovation and new product development. In the quarter, R&D, as a percentage of sales, was up 50 basis points year-over-year to 6.5%. This level of investment is much higher than where we were just a few years ago and is indicative of our long-term trajectory.  Our R&D efforts have led to a number of exciting new products throughout the portfolio, which in turn, we believe, are helping drive market share gains in many of our businesses, including Leica, Videojet, Fluke, Radiometer, Hach Lange and Kollmorgen, with other important product launches scheduled for later this year. During the quarter, we delivered strong operational performance as evidenced by the outstanding margin performance with our core operating margin improvement, up 245 basis points year-over-year. Each of our segments delivered at least 200 basis points of core margin improvement. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.61, representing a record first quarter for Danaher and a 33% increase as compared to our adjusted EPS last year.  Revenues for the quarter increased 11% to a record $3.3 billion, with core revenues up 10%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 1.5%, while the impact of deconsolidating the Apex revenues more than offset sales growth attributed to acquisitions, resulting in a net decrease of revenues of 0.5%. Our year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter increased 390 basis points to 52.7%, largely due to leverage from greater sales volumes, productivity improvements and the higher gross margins of our newer businesses. This is the third consecutive quarter that our gross margin has exceeded 50%. Overall, our operating margin in the first quarter increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%, with our core operating margin up 245 basis points. Included in the operating results was a $14.5 million in equity earnings contributed by Apex. Absent the Apex contribution, our operating margin was 17.2%. First quarter operating cash flow was $434 million, a 10% increase, notwithstanding a $100 million increase year-on-year in income tax payments made during the quarter. We expect the timing of our tax payments to normalize during the balance of the year. Free cash flow was $385 million.  During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $250 million to strengthen our Product ID and Water Quality platforms. We also announced the pending acquisition of Beckman Coulter. Based in Brea, California, Beckman is a leading supplier of in-vitro diagnostic systems, including instruments, consumables and software for the biomedical laboratory market. Its clinical diagnostic systems are found in hospitals and other clinical settings around the world and deliver critical information to physicians to diagnose disease, make treatment decisions and monitor patient care. To date, we have received U.S. anti-trust approval and expect to close the transaction late in the second quarter. We are looking forward to sharing with you more details after the closing. Turning to our 5 operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 27.5% for the quarter, with core revenues up 14%. Our core operating margin for the first quarter increased 270 basis points. Overall, our operating margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%.  Fluke core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, with solid demand in all major geographies and product categories. Emerging market revenues were up more than 20%, led by Brazil, where we are expanding our market presence with investments in feet on the street and a series of mid-priced core service and installation test tools.  At Tektronix, core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter, led by sales of oscilloscopes and logic analyzers, which were both up over 30%, partially offset by continued softness in the video end markets. The strength was broad-based geographically, led again by the emerging markets. We've been particularly pleased with the sales of our new mid-range line of oscilloscopes, the DPO/MSO4000 and 5000 series, which we launched last quarter.  Core revenues from our Communications businesses also grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, with healthy demand for both our core enterprise tools and our network management solutions. During the quarter, Verizon Wireless, selected Tektronix Communications to provide monitoring solutions for their next-generation LTE platform. This was an important and exciting win for the team, who were chosen in part due to the versatility and scalability of their products to provide deep end-to-end visibility into LTE network and service performance for Verizon. Environmental segment revenues increased 9% in the quarter, with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin was up 240 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin increased 230 basis points to 19.3%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a high single-digit rate. At Hach Lange, the demand was solid for our core lab and process instrumentation in all major geographies.  Industrial and food and beverage verticals in the U.S., Latin America and China were particularly robust during the quarter. Hach continues to focus on expanding its service capabilities, which have more than doubled in the past 2 years, and currently account for about 10% of total revenues. Trojan core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, driven by robust growth in its industrial applications. ChemTreat's core revenues also grew low double digits in the quarter. ChemTreat continues to expand outside the U.S. and their Canadian revenues have more than doubled in the last 2 years as they've invested in feet on the street initiatives to expand our penetration there. During the quarter, Hach expanded its direct sales and service team in Australia and New Zealand, with the acquisition of Accurate Group, enhancing our ability to provide local training and personalized application support in that region. This acquisition represents another example of Hach Lange expanding its direct go-to-market capabilities. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's first quarter core revenues increased in a mid single-digit rate, with robust shipments of dispensers and automatic tank gauges in North America and Europe, partially offset by slower global sales of payment and point-of-sale systems.  During the quarter, Gilbarco launched 2 new dispenser platforms, specifically designed for Eastern Europe and India. We expect these platforms to help capture additional market share in these fast-growing economies. Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased at 21.5%, compared to the prior year with core revenues up 9%. Our core operating margin was up 220 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 730 basis points from the prior year to 14.4%, primarily due to the first quarter 2010 acquisition-related charges that did not repeat in the first quarter of 2011.  Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate for the quarter. This performance has been driven by healthy demand in Europe, China and Japan for both the ABL90 and ABL80 blood gas analyzers, which bodes well for future consumable sales.  We also continue to build AQT's installed base outside of North America with placements up more than 30% in the quarter. Leica Biosystems' core revenues increased in excess of 10% in the quarter, with strong demand in North America and Europe for our advanced staining systems, which grew more than 20%. We believe that we continue to take share in this market.  During the quarter, we launched our HER2 fully automated breast cancer diagnostic test for the BOND system in Europe. This is a critically important addition to our companion diagnostics reagent offering as we are now able to aid in the selection and identification of specific targeted therapies for breast cancer patients. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate during the quarter, which we were particularly pleased with given the difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of Japanese stimulus activity in 2010.  Sales of compound and confocal microscopes into the life science research and industrial markets were particularly strong. During the quarter, we launched several of new research products including the SDAF inverted microscope with integrated spinning disc technology for high-speed comparable sectioning and 3D reconstruction, addressing the high-growth live-cell imaging market. We look forward to hosting investors at our Leica facility in Wetzlar, Germany in a couple of weeks to share with them more Leica success stories.  And core revenues at AB SCIEX grew to high single-digit rate in the quarter with robust demand from the academic proteomic and applied markets. Our new Triple TOF 5600 led the way. Proteomics Researchers are selecting the 5600 because it is able to deliver both qualitative and quantitative analysis effectively on a single platform. Customer acceptance and feedback on the new product continues to be outstanding.  Now full year into the acquisition, AB SCIEX is clearly seeing the benefits of new products, a much more focused go-to-market effort and the implementation of DBS. Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 7.5% in the first quarter with core revenues up 5.5%. Our core operating margin was up 275 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 220 basis points from the prior year to 10.7%.  KaVo revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter with solid demand in all major geographies for our instruments and imaging products. KaVo launched a record number of new products in the quarter at 2 of the largest dental industry trade shows, the Chicago Midwinter Show and The International Dental Show or IDS held in Germany.  Doctors are particularly excited about the new OP300, a hybrid digital imaging system, which integrates three imaging modalities; cephalometric using orthodontics, along with 2D Panoramic and 3D Cone Beam on a single unit, giving dentist a truly adaptable, flexible imaging platform.  As the digitization of the dental practice continues, the OP300 provides general practitioners for the first time with the range of technologies to perform more complex procedures such as implants in their own operatories instead of referring patients to the specialists. Sybron core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, with good growth in general dentistry consumables, infection prevention and orthodontic solutions. Sales in the emerging markets were again strong as we continue to invest together with KaVo and go-to-market initiatives in those high-growth areas.  During the quarter, we launched SonicFill, a new composite filling system that combines Kerr's composite technology with KaVo's hand piece technology. Customer feedback on this new product launch has been very positive. Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment, revenues increased 16% for the quarter with core revenues up 14.5%. Our core operating margin increased 200 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin was 21.3%, a 210 basis point increase compared to the same period last year.  Product Identification core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter, with broad-based global growth across all major product categories, including the Videojet's full suite of CIJ printers, where we believe we continue to capture share.  Demand from electronics customers for our parts marking instruments was again strong this quarter. During the quarter, we launched a new suite of large character marking or LCM systems for barcode graphics and alphanumeric printing and packaging applications. While still early, we've been pleased with customer feedback thus far.  And in March, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market based in Belgium. With revenues of about $250 million, Esko is an attractive adjacency to Videojet and our Product Identification platform.  Our Motion businesses' core revenues grew in excess of 20% in the quarter. The momentum we saw build last year continued as we experienced significant growth in all major geographies and end markets. The investments we've made during the last few years in our new AKM and AKD motors and drive, product lines continue to pay off with robust demand in the quarter, particularly among industrial automation customers. We believe we continue to capture market share with AKM and AKD, with volumes there up over 100% year-over-year. So, to wrap up, the first quarter 2011 was an excellent start for Danaher. Our portfolio of businesses is well-positioned. The investments we've made in innovation and emerging markets continue to drive growth and share gains. We are pleased with our team's performance, which led to outstanding core revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. We expect the global economy to continue to improve in 2011, led by the emerging markets, with the developed markets also growing, albeit at a lower rate. We believe we are well-positioned with DBS, driving our focus on our performance. We are initiating second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $0.62 to $0.67. Due to the broad strength we are seeing in our businesses, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from the prior range of $2.55 to $2.70, to a new range of $2.65 to $2.75 for the full year 2011. This includes $0.04 of anticipated net dilution resulting from the impact of the Pacific Scientific Divestiture and the EskoArtwork acquisition. This updated guidance excludes the impact of a pending acquisition of Beckman Coulter.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The gain on the sale of the Aerospace business, did you guys disclose the size of that before? That was $0.30 in the 10-Q?
Daniel Comas: We think it hasn't closed, it's eminent, and it will be about $0.30 after tax.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. So what are you -- you're going to restructure that away, obviously?
Daniel Comas: We'll call that out separately.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Will there be restructuring? Will there be incremental -- will you use that for incremental restructuring or no?
Daniel Comas: I think they'll be restructuring through the year, but we're not going to use that gain to offset it.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. So the numbers will be clean there?
Daniel Comas: Yes.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then the core growth moving throughout the year -- sorry, I got a lot going on this morning, core growth for the second quarter, what do you think there? And have you updated the core growth number for the year?
H. Culp: Steve, we do not envy your challenge today with everybody reporting. On the core growth side, I think, with what we saw in the first quarter, we come in to the second quarter here working against our toughest comp. But I think we're looking at 6% to 8% core in the quarter and, frankly, I think, probably looking at that rate for the year but feeling very good as we get going here in April for sure.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. So you'll be exiting the year at more of a kind of a 4% to 5% rate then?
H. Culp: No, I think if you look at where we would expect to be in the second quarter, I think we'll be in that 6% to 8% range. I suspect we'll be at the higher end of that range, given what we see right now. I think, for the full -- for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, I think we'll be in that 6% to 8% range. And even with the 10% of first quarter, we probably could be in that range for the year. I don't think we'll be that muted come year end, but we got a long way to travel. It's still early in the year between now and December.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Sure. And then orders, just the book-to-bill, one last question, for the quarter?
Daniel Comas: We're a little bit north of 1 and it trended nicely during the quarter.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
H. Culp: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Everybody handles earnings releases differently, I choose to eat doughnuts and drink lots of coffee and generally abuse myself. So on another note, your gross margin was just fantastic and be on kind of probably the most bullish of models. Talk about what drove that? I mean, obviously, you must be getting price out there because clearly, you couldn't have had any headwind on price cost with that kind of gross margin. I mean, how much of it is mix, how much of it is price, give us a little granularity on that?
H. Culp: Sure. Well, I think we -- while we do see some of those inflationary pressures and price was a positive, we nearly had a point of price. And I think that price-cost balance is in a good place, Scott, because as a 50% gross margin business, we don't have a lot of those core commodity exposures that some other folks, obviously, will. I think that with the core growth being better, particularly with some of our newer and/or higher gross margin businesses, that certainly helped. And I think we've just had very good execution from a cost and from the other variables in the gross margin calculation. I'm just, obviously, very pleased with the execution across-the-board in that regard. I think you saw that, really, in all 5 segments.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Okay, fair enough. As a follow-up, you've got a big one to bite off, Beckman. But are you still out there looking at deals? Is there capacity to look at deals? I mean, just talk to us about how you think about forward M&A and forward cash for investments?
H. Culp: Scott, I think we're very much in the position that we said we would be when we announced Beckman. Obviously, that transaction is still pending, but we're much in the deal game, not as much we typically would be. But you saw us announce another small acquisition here for water, we're looking at a number of things. We probably are talking about a deal envelope, barring other sources of capital, in the $300 million range for the rest of this year. But I think by and large, we get back into probably the $2 billion range in 2012, which at this point is only 9 months out. So I don't think at this juncture, we're feeling unduly pinched by, obviously, the implications from the Beckman deal.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's helpful. Good luck, guys. Thanks.
H. Culp: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: I'm surprised nobody answered that Beckman Coulter yet. So, there is a press release talking about any delays in the FDA address, so the high throughput machine, maybe you could give us some color on that and what it means?
H. Culp: What Beckman put out earlier this week was an update, I think, really for investors given the delay in their submission to the FDA for the approval or the re-approval of the Troponin test on their 2 major testing platforms. I think we want to respect the company's primacy on commenting on those sorts of matters in great detail, but I think given the work required, they basically wanted to make sure investors and their customers understood that they were going to be submitting to the FDA later than they had initially flagged. I don't think we were wildly surprised by that. There is a lot of work to do in preparing for those submissions. And it's work, obviously, that the company is very focused on. But in terms of the big picture relative to Beckman, I don't think the delay that they have announced is material.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Given your comment that it's a second -- late second quarter close, I mean, could you update us on the accretion dilution comments for '11 and '12?
Daniel Comas: Bob, it does appear that as opposed to closing and we may be having the business for 2 months in this quarter, it's more likely going to -- it could well be towards the end of June, and we won't have much of an impact here in the quarter. We'll come back and update as we get to closing or if we close the end of June, maybe we'll do it in the third week of July with earnings. But it could have some modest impact here in 2011. But given the things that we're working on, we have planned, I don't see that impacting our sort of 2012 outlook her.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Well, I mean, did you guys at one point that this could be $0.05 to $0.10 accretive this year and $0.25 to $0.30 accretive next year, just my memory may be failing me?
Daniel Comas: That's correct, Bob. And given the delay here, that obviously could have some impact on this year, but we don't see that impacting next year at this point.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Not next year. Final point, bigger picture point, you guys mentioned a couple of times the lower price point products and the variety of the end markets, I mean, could you just address the broad opportunity for Danaher to get into the local products at lower price points and make good margins? I mean, you mentioned that at a couple of points, and I'm sure that's a part of the R&D boost and so forth and so on and is that strategy going to impact gross profit margins? I mean, how is that all low price point emerging market development going to reflect itself in the results?
H. Culp: Well, Bob, I think that when we talk about our emerging market product strategy, we really want to play up and down the price point continuum for two reasons. The first thing, of course, the deeper we penetrate those markets, the faster we plug into the underlying growth in those markets. And secondly, the further we go down that price point continuum is, by and large, we really have started at the high-priced-point segment with our western brands. The tougher we make it for local competitors to come up the experienced curve and take that volume into the developed markets. I think when you look at what we've done in building the China businesses and are now really trying to drive in earnest in India and Brazil. We really start not with the high-priced point products and taking their prices down, but really putting together product specifications, building material cost targets and the like, so that we're geared towards meeting that differentiated customer need, at a cost position that allows us to drive margin maintenance and hopefully, we often aim for this, margin expansion. So, I don't believe there is an inherent tradeoff in humming down that price point continuum and your gross margins if the products back and the cost targets are designed upfront with that market reality in mind.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Yes, thanks. That's all for me. Very interesting. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Dan.
H. Culp: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: So just first question on, maybe at this point, working capital and your cash conversion, which was -- looks like still healthy, 90% plus, 92%, but down. And as you build for all this growth, what was your experience? It looks like your receivable days up, inventory days up a bit. I mean, how did that go or any issues?
Daniel Comas: Steve, it's Dan. The build we had at working capital was very consistent with what they've had in sort of prior years than the first quarter. The biggest driver of the year-on-year, on the sub-100%, still 90%, sub-100% conversion was we had a $100 million increase in tax payments year-on-year in the first quarter. Probably have pretty heavy tax payments here in Q2, but then that will flip in the second half. So, I think, from the broader issue on cash flow conversion, I think we're going to have a very strong year, particularly as we get in the second half with likely lower tax payments as compared to the second half a year ago. On the working capital side, as we did last year with double-digit core growth, we had a very modest increase in working capital. And I think if we are in that 6% to 8% range though that could suggest a multi-$100 million increase in working capital, we don't expect that at all. We think it will be -- working capital by the end of the year will be flat to slightly up.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay, all right, great. And may be on dental margin increase, which has been a long road. Can you comment about what the dynamics were in that business and how much is sort of the result of initiatives versus maybe just sort of tailwinds?
H. Culp: Well , I think with KaVo being up nearly 400 basis points, they would -- they'd argue they earned more of that. Obviously, the growth helps both at KaVo and at Sybron, but I really think, Steve, it's fundamentally the story that you're well aware of and we've told many times in terms of the efforts just to get that cost structure right and to make sure that we're driving growth that's accretive both in terms of our market share positions and our growth in operating margins.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay, all right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
H. Culp: Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jon Wood with Jefferies & Company.
Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So, Larry, could you talk about Test & Measurement, the book-to-bill in the first quarter and just talk about the year. Is it reasonable to assume that franchise can do double-digit in 2011 at this point or is it too early to go there?
H. Culp: Well, I think that we look at just book-to-bill for T&M. They -- where that matters most, I think, is at Tek, and they had north of 1.0 on a book-to-bill basis, and we were very pleased with that. I think if we look at TEK, we see a very good stream of new products forthcoming, which we're excited about. I mean given the -- our sense of the market, we'd probably have maybe a little more market risk in the wake of the Japan tragedy and T&M than we do some other businesses but, by and large, I'd suspect even with the tough comps that T&M will be one of the lead businesses for us this year relative to our core growth. I'd certainly expect them to be in the double-digit range here in the second quarter and certainly would not rule it out for the full year. They are very well positioned not only at TEK but, frankly, across that segment.
Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. One last one on SCIEX, and this is another big year for product introductions feasibly. Do you need another major product line turn this year to maintain kind of that high single-digit trajectory in your view or is the TripleTOF really in the early innings of penetration?
H. Culp: Well, I would say that first of all, we were very pleased with the performance at SCIEX. Really the first full quarter outside of the transition arrangement because we, obviously, anniversaried that deal. So to see the top line performance and the bottom line performance, at SCIEX, was reassuring and they, frankly, they did better than we would have anticipated in part because there has been so much work done, but also they probably had one of the tougher comps given the Japan stimulus of any of our businesses. Clearly, the 56 [TripleTOF 5600] has been impactful. I think we are in the early innings. But that said, there are other things forthcoming, and we're looking forward to being at ASMS in Denver come June and talking about the next wave of innovation at AB SCIEX.
Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for the comments.
H. Culp: Thank you, Jon.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'll start with Japan. Japan, I think, is about 5% of your total revs. And I think you guys had called out roughly a point of top line expectation drag from Japan this quarter, which I guess sort of implies Japan all else would be down about 20%. What did you actually see and what are you seeing there? And maybe you could comment on if you've seen any sort of supply chain issues and how you're dealing with that?
H. Culp: Yes, I think that -- first of all, John, what we saw since the earthquake is just an incredible level of strength, of character, of leadership on the part of our team. I don't think I've ever been more proud of our people, particularly given the circumstances that I have been with our Japan team. What we were flagging, obviously, immediately following the quake, was some concern that we could have some immediate revenue impact. We did not see that. That really didn't materialize in any meaningful way in the quarter. As you know, Japan's year end is March, so it was an important time, and there was real revenue at risk -- thrilled that it didn't materialize. I think what we, like most companies at this point, are trying to sort through, is just what happened as the ramifications from everything that has transpired here, work their way into the Japanese economy. It's less than 5% of sales. It's obviously important, but it's not like it's going to have, I think, a significant impact for us going through the rest of the year, as best we see, it in terms of our sales in Japan. But I would characterize the situation as being a bit fluid at this point. I think our greater concern, again, like most companies is how supply chains come back online during the course of the year. We haven't really baked in anything here relative to negative effects, but it's probably one of the variables in our outlook and certainly getting a lot of management attention because it only takes 1 specialty material. It only takes 1 IC that may come from a Northern Japanese facility, obviously, to ricochet through the -- a particular product line on a global basis. But at this point, I think as each day passes the news in that regard becomes more encouraging. But again, I think it's a dynamic that's getting a tremendous amount of work on this end. And we'll know -- we'll be smarter about things as we go through the course of the year. I don't think we can wholly categorically rule out some risk in that regard as we look out to the last 9 months of the year.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, well, Larry, understanding the broader risk, I'm just wondering, I mean, a lot of your products have some kind of electronic content in them, right? So have you identified...
H. Culp: They do.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, have you identified the one area that may be an issue? I'm just trying to think -- you wouldn't want to kind of hit a quarter and one of your segments sort of skips simply because you couldn't have supply chain issues. I'm just wondering if you thought about -- well, if there's anything, it's probably this area, and it's pertaining to this. And right now, we're trying to dual source or do something like that. I mean, have you identified anything in that regard yet or not really?
H. Culp: Well, John, I think we're well aware that we can't ship product if we're missing a particular component. I think given the nature of our products and the diversity of our portfolio, the risk that we're talking about here could crop up anywhere. I think what you really have to do and what we're doing, and I get an update on this every 48 hours is you literally have to go to the component level, right? This isn't about Northern Japan. It's not about a particular company or a commodity category. You've got to go to that SKU and understand the current inventory position, where that supplier is relative to their own production capability and verify that. So, we are at that point where we think we have risk, even a potential risk. We are working through sourcing inventory in other locations looking at resourcing options, availing ourselves of all those array of options. I think if you look at what we've been able to do over time in terms of holding on-time delivery in the face of growth, driving margin expansion in good times and in bad, we've got an outstanding procurement materials management team standing up to that test right now. But, again, I think that there's still a lot of work to do to work through our supply base to make sure that we have no disruptions to our customers, let alone our investors as we look through to the rest of 2011.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, that's fair. Can I ask you about China? You called China out as a continued source of strength, along with Brazil. China has obviously been trying to reign in growth to a degree and, obviously, Japan is a big trader with China. What are your folks on the ground saying, Larry, with respect to kind of the runway or trajectory for the rest of the year? Do you think kind of macro tightening is going to have much of an impact in your businesses and clearly, like Beckman has got a pretty good position in China as well. I'm just wondering if there are implications for Beckman as it pertains to China?
H. Culp: John, while we don't have a macroeconomist on staff in China, Dan and I did have the opportunity just 2 nights ago to do an in-depth review with the China team. On the back of an outstanding first quarter, despite the very real policy direction that you referenced, our team see nothing but very robust demand across the portfolio. It was striking. Their level of conviction and confidence given the start of the year and what they are hearing from customers. Again, I think we need to be very mindful of the issues that the Chinese Government are trying to bring to the fore. But right now we're very excited about the year we could have in China.
Daniel Comas: And for a number of us, those, our companies over there, we've had a very significant year-on-year increase in feet on the street and sales people over there. So in some cases, where they are seeing some modest slowing, we've got much better coverage. And we think we can kind of grow through that at these sort of rates.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: And just lastly, Larry, the big picture delay with respect to Beckman and the FDA that you called out, you said it was not material. Can you just help us understand, with respect to you guys, why is it not material? Meaning, just again, from sort of very high level, isn't there a risk that this kind of gets further delayed? Like at what point does it really become material, or is this simply because the deal is based truly on cost synergy, and you're not really that concerned about sort of this testing stuff getting into market on a timely basis?
H. Culp: John, just to be clear, what I intended to convey is that the delay here is not something that, in our view, is unanticipated, I think we didn't assume as I think we referenced back in January, that we were planning for perfection here relative to the resubmissions. So the slippage a bit here, as long as they get that application in and it's approved, and again, you go back to their 8-K, their caveats there, but given the planning assumptions that are in place on this end, I think we're still going to be in a very good place.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. I wasn't planning on asking a question about motion, but when you go across the businesses and motion stands out as really upside performance, you said 20%-plus growth all geographies all end markets. So if you just take us through some additional color here on was it retrofits or new capacity being added with the customers, share gains, any further color will be helpful?
H. Culp: Deane, thanks for asking because they really had a terrific performance on the back of, I think, of an excellent 2010. I think that there really is no one silver bullet here. In essence, what we referenced in the prepared remarks is very important. These new product introductions have really helped us with design wins. I think that we are doing a much better job, not only investing, but executing on the ground in the emerging markets, particularly in China. But that said, overall, the commercial execution on the part of the Kollmorgen and Thomson teams, Dan and I were just with them as well the other day, I think has dramatically improved vis-a-vis where it was just a few years ago. So, you've got technology, you've got better commercial capability, you've got more emerging market exposure and, obviously, you've got a market dynamic where the tailwinds are strong, put all that together, they're leading the way right now, for us, on the core growth side.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: I know Motion does not have much in the way of backlog, but in terms of visibility, quote activity, how sustainable does this look over the next couple of quarters?
H. Culp: Well, obviously, the comps get tougher for them and I think we'll see their core growth taper a bit as we go through the year. But I would still expect them to be a growth leader for us this year. While they don't have maybe booked backlog per se, Deane, I think as you look at their design wins and their likely shipments, assuming certain build rates on the part of their OEM customers, they're looking at a good 2011.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great. And then Just last one from me, regarding the 2011 guidance increase. If my -- looking at the incremental margins, based upon what we've talked about in December, 35% to 40%, looks like you could be tracking towards the upper end of that range. Is that still your outlook for the year on incrementals?
H. Culp: Yes, I think that's a fair assessment, Deane. Obviously, with a range of 265 to 275, if you dialed in the high end of that core growth range for the year of 6% to 8% with a mid to high 30 ECM, you kind of get to that – you get into that zone. I think, again, I think one of the things we want to make sure we share with folks is that, we had an outstanding first quarter, great start for the year. We are mindful the Japanese risks that are out there, maybe more so on the global supply chain than local sales, but they are both real, still fluid. Clearly, some inflationary pressures out there. And, I think, with all that said, we certainly want to make sure that in a year like this, we are investing ahead both with respect to growth and margin expansion. So we've already begun some of the dialogue here about what are some of the things we might have thought were really 2012 initiative that we might be able to action this year. That's part of what we want to do here, to make sure we've got the latitude, not only to deliver a good 2011, but also continue to build for '12 and '13.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll make our question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: We can talk through margins a little bit, very strong moving industrial TEK margins. Do we see these fairly sustainable given the continued strength that is going to be likely in the Product ID in Motion or is it going to be small drop-offs, certainly in 2Q with Esko being folded in now?
Daniel Comas: Yes, you'll, Mark, operationally, we expect to see these sort of margins for the balance of the year. We will have about $25 million of non-cash expenses related to Esko acquisition that'll bleed out, primarily in Q2, but some in the second half as well. So, the margins we're seeing in Motion, Product ID, the other businesses, Industrial remain quite strong. We're seeing a little bit of inflation, but we're also getting pretty good price, particularly at Motion. And we think, absent some of these non-cash charges, which will bring the reported margin down, the true operating margins we think we can sustain at these levels.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thank you. I was going to ask about the -- with steel prices going up at Motion, would be safe as well, so thanks for that. And then as you kind of think about margins on Test & Measurement, as you continue to integrate Keithley, do you see a pretty good trajectory there, assuming T&M stays pretty healthy, which it seems that it will at least through '11?
Daniel Comas: Sure. I mean, we clearly -- we had almost 21% in the first quarter. And I think you'll see some modest sequential improvement maybe to 50, 100 basis points over the next couple of quarters in T&M margins as well in part as we partially as we get the benefit of integrating Keithley.
H. Culp: And thanks for bringing Keithley up, Mark, because that is an acquisition, obviously, rather recent perhaps overshadowed by Beckman. That integration, that activity has gone exceptionally well. We're very pleased with the team, their embrace of Tektronix. The opportunities really to partner both from a new product development and technology view, but also in terms of leveraging the Tektronix global channels to help accelerate Keithley sales. Very pleased to have that one on board.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Right. And was there kind of core sales for Keithley kind of similar to the segment average or are they closer to what TEK put up, 5% to 8%.
H. Culp: They were very much in line with the rest of the team.
Daniel Comas: I think the rest of T&M.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: So, obviously the delay in the closure of Beckman, does this change any way the size of the acquisition? The reason I ask is that you guys are earning roughly $4 million of free cash flow a quarter. So in theory, it just reduce the need to raise cash. So, I mean, just any comment on that would be helpful?
Daniel Comas: Nigel, I think that our previous disclosure of around $1 billion of equity, I think that still stands. We're pleased with the cash flow, very strong with our cash position, which will, hopefully, in the coming days, as we close Pacific Scientific, we'll be north of $2 billion. And that, obviously, will go towards the Beckman acquisition. I think we're still comfortable with equity in that sort of range. In part, we want to give ourselves some latitude here on the M&A side.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, and then GVR doesn't get a lot of ad time but high oil prices, retail gas prices, pushing $5 a gallon, I mean, how does the investment environment change with high gas prices? Do they tend to spend more CapEx and could that benefit GVR? Anything you've seen in the past that might suggest that?
H. Culp: Well, I think that there have been some rules of thumb in the past that would suggest at least in the developed markets that retail spend tracks pretty well with retail margin. But the market has really undergone, I think, a good deal of change over time. Obviously, the emerging markets are far more important there, a bit less sensitive to that regard. The offering that we have given the automation, around the payment POS and card list, has also been a driver that has defied some of the underlying economics. So I think we worry about that dynamic less. But clearly, what we've seen is a real uptick in investment broadly that we think will continue over the next several years. In the short-term though, Nigel, as you know, we had an exceptional year last year in payment, particularly given some of the compliance deadlines. And that's where we're probably facing some of our stiffest headwind here in the second quarter and through the rest of this year, and GVR, looking at the second quarter, just here in the short-term likely is going to be down low double digits in part because of these tougher comps that will bring the core and environmental down to probably a flattish figure, offsetting some good performance in water quality. But long term, I think we see good investment levels around the world and that, combined with these automation requirements, positions GVR very well, let alone, of course, the uptick in environmental concerns at retail.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Sure. And then just finally, just to clarify your comments on Japan, mean it's encouraging that you don't see a major impact on the financials, they're down for the year, but just to kind of clarify in late March and through April, you haven't seen a significant sort of deterioration in your Japanese business?
H. Culp: That's right. When we were together in New York, what we were watching twice daily was just what the implications would be from the disruptions to the infrastructure, let alone customer operations and the like. That news got better virtually every day as we went through March, and they finished pretty much in line with the original expectation, which I thought was simply remarkable. I think at this point, as things evolve, we don't see today tremendous negative headwind there. But I think probably next to some of the specific issues at GVR, we are expressing some caution around the situation on the ground in Japan. But thus far, I think we feel like that's manageable.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Great. Thanks a lot.
H. Culp: Thank you, Nigel.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Larry and Dan, could you address in the Life Sciences, LSD segment, the operating margin there, just on an absolute basis, I think I understand the basis point improvement year-over-year with the restructuring cost and things at AB SCIEX, but at this 14.4% level, is that -- again, is that sustainable? Was that helped by mix? It sounds like the TSA is out, that probably helps and should be sustainable. Do we build off of that margin level for the balance of the year?
Daniel Comas: Rick, I think at this point, we think we'll be in that range. I mean, it was a quirk that everything went right for LSD, both the top line and the mix was very favorable. As you know, a year ago, that segment margins were 7%. So, we doubled it year-on-year. Also, in part because some of the strength we're seeing there, we've ramped up some investments both on the growth side. We've got some clinical studies at both Radiometer and Leica Bio that will cost some money here in the next couple of quarters. There's also some restructuring. So, I think we're very pleased where we are. I'm not sure you'll see movement here, in fact, I think sequentially in Q2, because some of these growth investments in restructuring, sequentially, margins will come down a little bit. Spending will be in sort of the mid-teens range for the full year, but we'll be doing things this year that will hopefully get us another leg up in 2012.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then Larry, is there any movement that you can kind of mention on the AQT product in the U.S. in terms of approval?
H. Culp: There is movement, and that's probably all I should say. I think what you've seen us try to do is avoid being specific given the process that we're going through right now with the authorities that we continue to make progress. But in terms of when we'll able to launch, I think I'm going to defer that to the day we launch. But we're thrilled. I think it's important to recognize that, that product outside of the U.S. continues to be well accepted. We saw another good quarter of placement globally. We're up to nearly 500 instruments installed. That, obviously, really begins to build, I think, an exceptional foundation for the consumable stream as utilization picks up. So, we're very encouraged that we've got the right product. We are going to make sure we address the questions and the needs of the U.S. regulators. And once we do, we'll be ready to go.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Is it likely this year, I mean, that we hope this year?
H. Culp: I stand by my prior comments.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: That's okay. There is positive movement, got it. And then one other thing, it just felt like we maybe took a little extra time to highlight some of the new products in some of the segments and we've got some key major price point products like the 5600 that have come to market now. Would you look at your growth rate this year thinking 6% to 8% core for the full year? Would you feel like there is maybe a point, probably not 2, but a point or 2 of incremental growth that is more than end market recovery and it's a fairly aggressive new product intro this year relative to past?
H. Culp: Well, I think we're getting better at execution in terms of conception, development and launch. We're obviously spending more money. You see that in the uptick in R&D. I think it's really, in many respects, table stakes in some of these industries and markets that we've entered. What's really hard to segment, Rick, is when we drive growth even with tailwind. How much of that, typically, while we've got this increased vitality, will we attribute to the new products vis-a-vis the improved commercial and go-to-market execution. It's just very hard. I don't think we want to try to internally get into that game. If we're winning, we're winning. We're doing everything we can to do so, to try to parse that for ourselves, let alone for you. I'm not sure that's high value-add.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Yes, that's fine. Okay, thank you.
H. Culp: Yes, thank you, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And due to time constraints, our last question will come from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones, on second quarter core, you guys had talked about a number of different segments. Just wondering if you could follow up on Industrial and Dental?
Daniel Comas: Sure, Terry. I think Dental, we continue to see in sort of that mid single-digit rate. Industrial, probably double-digit, 10%, 10% plus.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And where is Apex in full year guidance at this point?
Daniel Comas: They came in about -- they contributed about $15 million in the quarter. We expect that to be about $60 million for the full year, good ramp up over last year, but they're also doing a fair amount of restructuring which, again, I think will get another step up in 2012.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, and then kind of lastly, kind of a follow-up on the last question, Larry. A lot of benefit from new products growth, a better margins and, really, I guess the question is, as we move in to 2012, does the curve or the impact of all that sort of start to flatten or do you see the flattening further out beyond 2012? I know it's tough because you have a lot of different segments and products. But I think -- maybe just touch on that?
H. Culp: Sure. I think we feel very good about those things that we can control, both from an innovation and a go-to-market perspective. I think with all the history that's been made in the macros seen in the last 3 months, we're not going to get too far our ahead of ourselves on those calls, but I think we like the positions that we have, and we like the markets that we're in. If the global recovery continues the pace, we're going to be very well placed. We're well-positioned going to '12 and '13.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: So does R&D stay at 6.5% through the year or should we expect that to come back down?
H. Culp: It should be in that zone. I mean well, obviously -- part of the latitude that we want to make sure we retain through the year is to take that up above plan, above budget, where those opportunities present themselves. And we had a couple of discussions just this week, too, in that direction.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Maybe just squeeze just one last one in, did you call out Videojet core in the quarter?
Daniel Comas: We did. It was in mid-teens.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. Thanks very much.
H. Culp: Thanks, Terry.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Matt McGrew for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Casey. Just Dan and I are around all day today for any follow-up calls. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

H. Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 2010 was an outstanding year for Danaher. We grew 13% organically in the fourth quarter, wrapping up an exceptionally strong year for all of our businesses. Core growth in the fourth quarter was broad based across the segments led by Test & Measurement, up 24%; Industrial Technology is up 15.5%; and Life Sciences & Diagnostics, up 10%.   The double-digit core growth seen throughout the year was certainly helped by the economic recovery but also by all the work we've been doing the last several years reshaping the portfolio, expanding margins, which in turn has allowed us to accelerate organic investment, while obviously executing well with the Danaher Business System.  We've re-weighted many of our investments with a focus on the emerging markets, which positions us well in the fastest-growing parts of the world. Those investments are paying off as the emerging markets were our best performer in the quarter, up more than 25%. China grew in excess of 30% despite challenging year-over-year comps with our Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Environmental businesses leading the way. We are pleased to report that four brands reached the $100 million revenue mark in China in 2010, Fluke, Hach, Tektronix and Leica, a great achievement for those businesses and an example of how solid execution and the best team wins.  The growth model we've developed in China is being aggressively exported around the world, most notably to India, which we believe will be a significant contributor to our long-term growth. We were also encouraged by the continued strength in the developed economies as both the U.S. and Europe grew about 10%.  The quality of our core growth was evidenced in the outstanding margin performance in the quarter with our core operating margin improving 230 basis points year-over-year, with each of our segments achieving at least 150 basis points of core margin improvement. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter.   Today, we reported fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.69, up 72.5% from last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per diluted share was $0.67, up 19.5% year-over-year. Included in our fourth quarter results is over $60 million of accelerated restructuring and incremental growth spending, which will benefit us in 2011 and beyond.  For the full year, GAAP-diluted net earnings per share was $2.64, a 52.5% increase compared to 2009. Adjusted diluted net earnings per diluted share was $2.31, up 30.5%. Revenues for the quarter increased 15% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, with core revenues up 13%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, and acquisitions contributed 3.5% to sales growth. Our full year 2010 revenues were up 18% year-over-year to $13.2 billion, with core revenues up 11.5%.  Year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 510 basis points to 51%, largely due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of our prior year's restructuring initiatives. Operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 480 basis points year-over-year to 17.4% resulting from higher sales volumes, lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year and the benefit of those prior year's restructuring initiatives. Included in the operating results was $12.2 million in equity earnings contributed by Apex, which accounted for approximately 40 basis points of operating margin in the fourth quarter. Absent the Apex contribution, our operating margin was 17%. For the full year, our operating margin was 16.4% compared to 13.8% in 2009.   2010 operating cash flow was $2.1 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow was a record $1.87 billion, a 12% increase over our previous all-time high generated in 2008. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 104%, representing the 19th year in a row, where we delivered free cash flow in excess of our net income. More meaningfully, excluding the after tax $232 million non-cash Apex gain, our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 110% [ph] (1:08:53).  During the fourth quarter, we completed four acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $200 million to strengthen our Environmental, Test & Measurement, Product ID and Dental businesses. Excluding the AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices transactions, which we announced in 2009 and closed early in 2010, we completed 17 transactions in 2010 and deployed $1.1 billion of capital. And as you've seen from some of our recently announced news, the M&A environment remains very attractive.  Now turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 34% for the quarter, with core revenues up 24%. For 2010, revenues increased 27.5%, with core revenues up 17%. Our core operating margin was up 155 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior year's restructuring initiatives. Reported operating margin increased 120 basis points to 19.8% due to the core margin expansion as well as lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year.  Fluke core revenues increased more than 20% in the quarter, with solid demand in all major geographies for thermography and industrial products. Growth in the emerging markets, led by the BRIC countries, was especially strong. During the quarter we launched the 190 Series II, our first four-channel ScopeMeter. This new product is designed for plant maintenance engineers and technicians who use the scope meters to go into harsh industrial conditions to test everything from microelectronics to power electronics applications.  At Tektronix, core revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter, led by sales of oscilloscopes in all major geographies. During the quarter we introduced our new midrange line of oscilloscopes, the MSO DPO5000 Series, which we featured at the year-end investor meeting last month, and have been very pleased with the early results.   During the quarter we completed the previously announced acquisition of Keithley Instruments. Keithley is a leader in advanced bench top electrical test instruments and systems used by scientists and engineers for research, product development and high-performance production testing.  Core revenues from our Tektronix Communications business grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, with healthy demand for both our core enterprise tools and our network management solutions.   Arbor Networks, which we acquired in the third quarter, is off to a running start. Arbor's revenues in the fourth quarter grew at a mid-teens rate compared to a year ago, when it was a stand-alone business, as service providers, data centers and large enterprise customers look to fortify their networks against malicious website intrusions known as DDoS [distributed denial of service] attacks.  Environmental revenues increased 7.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 8.5%. For 2010, revenues increased 13% year-over-year with core revenues up 10.5%. Core operating margin was up 165 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior year's restructuring initiatives. Reported operating margin increased 390 basis points to 22.1% due to the core margin expansion as well as lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year.  Warner quality core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate with Hach Lange, Trojan and ChemTreat all up 10% or more in the quarter. At Hach Lange, demand remains strong across all geographies in our core lab and process instrumentation markets. In fact, Hach Lange surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2010 with China alone exceeding $100 million.  Trojan core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter driven by robust growth in industrial, residential and municipal applications despite challenging year-over-year comps. In the second half of 2010, Trojan launched four major new products led by the Solo Lamp and Signet disinfection system. We anticipate these new products will further strengthen our market share position as we head into 2011.  During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Satlantic based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Satlantic's product portfolio of optical sensors and systems for aquatic research and water quality monitoring complements and expands our growing oceanographic instrumentation product group. Also in the quarter, Hach increased its investment in DKK-TOA Corporation based in Tokyo, Japan. Hach now owns 33.4% of DKK-TOA, which is a strategic partner offering a broad range of water lab instruments and process analyzers, such as drinking and wastewater analyzers, environmental water quality analyzers and other lab and portable instrumentation.  Gilbarco Veeder-Root's fourth quarter of core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate year-over-year with robust shipments of dispensers around the world. Veeder-Roots' Phase-Two Water Detector introduced last quarter has been very positively received by operators looking to monitor and protect underground storage tanks from ethanol-blended fuel phase separation. Also in the quarter of note, GVR was awarded three major payment system integration projects in the Asia Pac region.  Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 58% compared to the prior year with core revenues up 10%. For 2010, core revenues increased 55% with core revenues up 9%. Core operating margin was up 530 basis points in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior year's restructuring initiatives. Reported operating margin was up 50 basis points from the prior period to 13.1% due to the core margin expansion and lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year, partially offset by the impact of recent acquisitions, namely AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices.   Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter with strong demand for both our advance staining and core histology products in Asia and North America. Over the last several quarters, we've accelerated the placement of our BOND III advanced staining system with sales growing at a double-digit rate in the quarter and for the full year. The growing install base positions us well to take advantage of the profitable consumable streams heading into 2011 and beyond.   Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, driven by sales of confocal microscopes in Europe and China. We continue to see good order growth in the quarter, particularly in China, Brazil and other emerging markets.   At Radiometer, core revenues grew at a low double-digit rate in the quarter. This performance has been driven by healthy demand in Europe and China for the ABL90 and ABL80 blood gas analyzers, which bodes well for future consumable sales.   AQT continues to build on its early success as we doubled instrument placements in 2010 versus 2009. We are pleased with the year one results from SCIEX and Molecular Devices. The integration of the two halves of the JV, a complex operational task, has gone very well, and we couldn't be happier with where the team and the business are here as we are close to celebrating our first year anniversary. Our customers have responded well, particularly in the second half of 2010 as we began shipping the 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometer. AB SCIEX revenues in the second half of the year were up double-digit as compared to a year ago when it was a stand-alone business unit.  Molecular Devices also performed well in the quarter with revenues up high single digits, led by solid demand for plate readers and imaging products. The recently introduced IonWorks products help researchers analyze ion channels of cellular membranes for genetic disorders, and chemicals in order to facilitate the discovery of drugs related to cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous and immune systems. Those products continue to do well in the marketplace.  Turning to Dental segment. Revenues increased 6.5% in the fourth quarter with core revenues up 7.5%. For the full year, Dental revenues increased 10% with core revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin was up 255 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior-year restructuring initiatives. Reported operating margin was up 730 basis points from the prior-year period to 12.1% due to the core margin expansion as well as lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year.  KaVo revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, while we enjoyed solid demand for our imaging products, including 3D and intraoral sensors. We also saw a good growth in both our treatment unit and instruments.   Throughout 2010, dental practitioners returned to investing in their practices. In addition to the good organic growth, core operating margins were up meaningfully again in the quarter, and we feel confident in our ability to continue to drive growth and margin expansion at KaVo in 2011.  Sybron core revenues grew at mid single-digit rate in the quarter with improved sales in general dentistry consumables and orthodontia products. In the quarter we launched the OptiBond XTR, a new light cure adhesive designed to minimize postoperative sensitivity and maximize patient comfort. Sybron and KaVo continue to work together to capitalize on synergies between the two platforms, this past quarter hosting their first joint dealer conference in China allowing customers to see our consumables offering alongside our hand pieces, treatment units, imaging products and the rest of the KaVo portfolio. Similar events are planned for other geographies later this year.  During the quarter we acquired Implant Direct, giving us a leadership position in the high-growth value segment of the dental implant market. We're excited about the opportunity to leverage our global distribution network to drive penetration and expand the geographic reach in this attractive growth segment.  Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 14% for the quarter with core revenues up 15.5%. For 2010, revenues increased 14% with core revenues up 13.5%. Core operating margin increased 255 basis points in the fourth quarter resulting from the benefit of restructuring and cost initiatives implemented in 2009, as well as the higher sales volumes in the segment. Reported operating margin was 18.9%, a 700 basis point increase compared to the same period last year due to the core margin expansion as well as lower restructuring expenses compared to the prior year.  Product Identification core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter, with strength in both equipment and consumables and across all major product categories. Growth in the emerging markets and Europe was particularly robust. We introduced the Videojet 3010 fire laser in October, a low-cost laser targeting consumer products and pharma applications in China Central and Latin America. In the quarter, Videojet acquired a Mexican distributor allowing us to commence direct operations in that country. This is the fourth distributor acquisition Videojet has made in the past five years. Directly serving our customers in this important emerging market will allow us to accelerate the growth of our full range of products in the region and further improve our reputation for providing uptime piece of mind to our customers.  Subsequent quarter end, we announced the pending acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market. Headquartered in Gent, Belgium, EskoArtwork's suite of software and hardware solutions helps its customers reduce digital design cycle time and ensure integrity throughout the packaging material supply chain. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2011. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to EPS by approximately $0.02 in 2011 and $0.04 in 2012.  Our Motion business' core revenues were up more than 20% in the quarter. We experienced significant growth in all major geographies and markets. In the quarter, Kollmorgen was awarded a multimillion dollar contract to supply AKM and AKD motors and drives to one of Europe's leading packaging OEMs. This program has opened up potential additional opportunities with that customer and demonstrates the power of the solutions generated by our new global platforms.  Subsequent to quarter end, we announced an agreement to sell our Pacific Scientific Aerospace business to Meggitt PLC for $685 million. In 2010, Pac Sci had revenues of approximately $378 million and contributed $0.07 to diluted earnings per share. This transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, the business will be treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes.  So to wrap up, 2010 again was an outstanding year for Danaher. We continue to evolve the portfolio to higher growth, higher technology, more global businesses, where our brands are clear market leaders. The investments we're making and innovation in emerging markets are driving growth and share gains. We continue to generate excellent free cash flow and deploy that cash back into the business through acquisitions. We expect the global economy to continue to improve in 2011, led by the emerging markets, with the developed markets also growing, albeit at a slower rate. We believe we are well positioned heading into 2011 with DBS driving our focus on our performance.   We're pleased with the momentum at which we exited the fourth quarter and moved into January. At this time, we are reaffirming our full year and first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings per share guidance of $2.55 to $2.70 and $0.52 to $0.57, respectively. This excludes the net impact of the pending sale of our Pacific Scientific Aerospace business and the pending acquisition of EskoArtwork. We will update our guidance after these transactions have closed.
Matt McGrew: Thanks Larry. That concludes the formal comments. We are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So I just wanted to ask about -- you're obviously exiting the year at a really good run rate. There's been a lot of -- a little bit of talk about some budget flush towards year end. Obviously, the end of December ended pretty well. I mean, how good was the end of December and are you seeing kind of normal seasonality here in January?
H. Culp: Steve, I don't think we saw anything that we would describe as abnormal at year's end. We just had a December that started well and ended well. It's hard to dismiss completely some sort of budget flushes, as you say. But I think we had genuine robust demand hold up virtually across the businesses and across the key geographies. I don't think you register 13% core as we did without that. And I think, while it's very early, obviously, here in the new year, I think, by and large, the businesses and the teams are feeling good about the prospects for 2011.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And so, what's your first quarter organic growth guidance again?
H. Culp: Well, I think we've talked about full year guidance, Steve, in the 6% to 8% band. That's what we put out for the full year back in December, if you'll recall. I think that if you use that band for purposes of looking at the first quarter, I expect the quarter to get to the high end of that range. Keep in mind, we've got one less selling day in the quarter, which will slightly impact our Consumables business. But I think by and large, I think we're optimistic about the first quarter here.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: On acquisitions, I like the move in to Nova Scotia, that seems like an interesting acquisition. But anything out there that's kind of bigger on the horizon for you guys? Obviously, this Artwork's deal looks pretty interesting it's the key to be right down the middle, but how are the big properties moving around these days? Is the pipeline any more robust than it was a year, two years ago?
H. Culp: I think we're excited about the deal pipeline. It certainly has been a longstanding priority for us to add more quality businesses to Product Identification. That's been one platform of five where we have not been as active as we would have liked. So bringing on Esko [EskoArtwork], a high-quality business, I think, is a wonderful addition to that platform. We're excited about their growth trajectory, and frankly, their margin expansion potential as we introduced them to some of our customers and relationships around the world. I think with respect to the deal pipeline, I would characterize it perhaps very much as I did in mid-December. It is very full. We are exceptionally busy. The nature of the situations that we're looking at really span the entire priority list of platforms here, the five core areas that we've often talked about. Is it better than it was a year or two ago? Certainly, two years ago, things were in some chaotic state. I would say it's better and it's probably better than it was a year ago, given that many people were still kind of trying to figure out which end was up. So again, I think that Dan and I have tried to be consistent. Of late, we obviously -- we were with you out in San Francisco a few weeks ago. We think this is going to be an active year for Danaher deploying capital as we strengthen our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: A couple of big things in the quarter, I mean, one, obviously, Test & Measurement just had a blowout. But just to back up a little bit and take a look at gross margins. You've had pretty amazing improvement year-over-year. I mean, 510 basis points, I don't think I've ever seen that at another company. I mean, can you give us a sense of how much of that is mix of new acquisitions that come in at margin versus actual structural changes or restructuring that you've made? And obviously, some macro impact of retail and factories, but do you have a sense at all, at least to how that breaks down?
Daniel Comas: Scott, in terms of a year-over-year basis, there's very little impact from acquisitions. It is a little bit overstated because of some of the restructuring spending, which was more Q4 last year than it was this year, but we took out -- it was 37 rooftops. And I think that's been a big driver of that gross margin improvement as well as double-digit core growth and leveraging that cost base. And as we talked about in December, our -- ended up core revenues being up 11%, our G&A manufacturing headcount was only up 2%. And that was, of all the things, that was the biggest driver of accelerating the gross margin year-on-year.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Test & Measurement, and I don't want to duplicate in the questioning kind of budget flush, but you've had such an amazing ramp in that business. And maybe a different way to ask the question is just, how sustainable is -- I know you hit tougher comps, but how sustainable? I mean, is this a new replacement cycle, a new product that's occurring, for example at Tektronix? Were there just so much pent-up demand in 2010 that it was kind of a once and done?
H. Culp: Scott, I would submit that it's a number of different things. Obviously, working against the easy comps in '09 certainly helped with the print. But I think you see an innovation cycle across the served markets for TEK, which is significant. I think, particularly at TEK, we are more effective competing in the marketplace. We have a number of quality competitors. But as you recall, when we were going through the initial integration and restructuring, the first couple of years are probably more internally focused than externally focused. That balance has really shifted. I think at Fluke -- what you're seeing is, Fluke continuing to do what it does in a good global market, innovating aggressively, investing in the emerging markets. I was with the team in China a few weeks ago celebrating the $100 million club. Just so many good vectors for them to put into as China grows. Fluke's done it, they're continuing to do it. And don't forget what we're doing at TEK Communications. Particularly with network management as the mobile carriers expand, their networks, particularly around data management, what we do to help them tackle those bandwidth challenges, quality of service challenges is not insignificant. And that's been a really important part of the T&M growth story. So just no one thing -- a whole host of things that I think come together here to obviously put a very strong year together in 2010 and give us, I think, a high level of confidence about their ability to continue to be a strong performer for us.
Operator: Moving on we'll go to Barclays Capital, Bob Cornell.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: On the guide, you guys, it sounds like you're balancing a lot of pluses and negatives, right? And positives and negatives, I mean, clearly the organic growth has accelerated a bit, as you thought in the fourth quarter way above the early guide, and the first quarter you're saying 6% to 8%. So it looks like the underlying momentum in the businesses may be better than the guide, and yet, then with the combination of the Aero and the acquisition you're looking at some dilution. So maybe you could help us balance what you're thinking there with maintaining the guide x the capital allocation decisions?
H. Culp: Well, Bob, I think I'd say this, we're certainly encouraged by the strong finish. I mean, I think that's where the conversation starts, and obviously, again while it's early, the good start here in '11. I think our habit has been not to try to update guidance moments after we announced a transaction, let alone two, one inbound, one outbound. They're clearly going to have some impact here. We tried to provide that in isolation. I just think it's prudent for us to wait a little bit here, until we get at least closer to getting those deals on board, let alone getting further into the year, before we update guidance that we put out, basically a month ago. Obviously, the net effect of the divestiture and Esko coming in will be dilutive. But I think there's some other tailwinds out there, not the least of which is the strong finish and the good start here. Obviously, Europe is going to help us a little bit and obviously on taxes, like some other folks, we're talking about a slightly lower provision versus the 26% figure that we put out there in December. So I think all up, again we'll come back here when we have a little bit more clarity around the timing to update guidance again. But all in all, I think we're looking at a good year.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Well, is it fair to say too, and asked in one of your earlier questions -- you are looking at an active capital allocation year. I mean, just looking at the math, based on what you've got proposed in these deals, I mean, are we looking at accretion on potential deals, balancing the divested dilution potentially?
H. Culp: Well, again, Bob, I think we've tried never to project forward unnamed inbound deal flow and the positive effects from that. So I think, I want to just stand by what I've said, relative to Pac Sci and Esko, but again to reiterate, we think we're going to be very active this year. And we've talked about $4-plus billion of capital at the ready here, a very full pipeline. And I would be -- I'd be disappointed if we didn't put that capital to work this year.
Operator: We'll go to John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: I want to ask you, 15.5% organic growth in the Industrial business, but the margin's declined sequentially. Is there some reason, was it raw material costs or some other reasons why you didn't get more of an uplift?
Daniel Comas: John, the biggest driver sequentially was the amount of restructuring we did in the segment, which was -- the restructuring and the incremental growth spend was over $10 million in the segment. So if you adjusted for that, we would have been north of 20% in the segment. Having said that, that is the one segment and it's particularly Motion, where we are seeing some real pockets of inflation. Just in the last 90 days, steel and kind of related products up double-digits, some copper-related products are up 20%. Fortunately for us it's isolated, but if there's one segment that has seen some impact and will probably continue to see some impact, is Industrial, and specifically the Motion business. So sequentially, most of the explanation is really the restructuring. But we are definitely watching some of these commodity issues.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: So Dan, that does trend with respect to margins in Industrial carry forward for the next quarter or two? Or are you doing something to kind of redress this now as we sort of think about modeling out or just fine tuning the model for 2011?
Daniel Comas: I think it's going to have a little bit of pressure. It's part of the reason we put more restructuring there than anywhere. I had also said that Motion did the best job across the company on price. They got between 2% and 2.5% price in the quarter, so they're getting some offset. But when you're looking at double-digit increases in some commodities, it's impacting Motion. Now we're not seeing that at PID, given a more kind of printed circuit board base as most of our other businesses where we're not seeing inflation. But there's going to be a little pressure there. We're going after the cost, we're getting a little bit more on price, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's the segment where kind of the core margin increases is probably towards the lower end versus what we see at the other segments.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Again, would you be able to take, I think, you did about $15 million of restructuring? Could you parse that out amongst the other segments? So you did about $10 million in Industrial, what about the other segments?
Daniel Comas: The largest, which was a little bit bigger than that, was Dental, and the other three were kind of in the $5 million to $10 million range.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Your investment in Align, I think there is some sort of a standstill agreement that ends on February 16. It looks like it's worth $155 million. Could you talk about the implications of that and sort of what your thoughts are with respect to your share ownership?
H. Culp: John, I would simply say that Align continues to be an important partner for us, as we look at opportunities to parlay that equity position into innovative orthodontia products that combine the best of both companies. So we continue to have a lot of optimism there. But beyond that, I think that's where we are.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: So would it be fair to say, Larry, you're going to be opportunistic perspectively with the investment or is the investment sort of an important part of continuing the partnership?
H. Culp: I think it's been a terrific investment for the Danaher shareholder, and I think it's an important part of our relationship with Align.
Operator: Moving on, we'll go to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Guys, realizing that you're one of AB SCIEX is more about integration and kind of tying it all together, not necessarily growth per se. But can you give us a sense of what kind of the pro forma organic growth profile of the business was in '10 and kind of what's embedded in your thoughts in '11, now as it anniversaries into the base?
H. Culp: Jeff, I think the important period to look at for SCIEX is really the second half. I mean, that's what I've keyed on. We were up double digits at AB SCIEX. I don't think that, that's necessarily going to be a double-digit grower through a cycle. But I think SCIEX can be a mid- to high-core business for us. And as we look forward here, we obviously have tremendous momentum with the 5600. We won't comp that until late in 2011. My trip around the emerging markets this month just saw a lot of enthusiasm, really for the full offering across both the research, the clinical and the applied spaces where we operate in China, India and even the Middle East. So I think all in, we got a good start. I would submit, given the work that we were doing, it was probably more internally focused than externally focused. But that really began to change hard and fast in the third quarter. So from that perspective, I think we come into the new year, really, right where we want to be with AB SCIEX.
Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And I think Dan said but I may have missed, was there a comment on the exit rate of March inside AB SCIEX, if not, could you give us that?
Daniel Comas: Jeff, if you probably look at SCIEX and Molecular Devices together, we think combined next year, they are low teens and probably exiting -- hopefully exiting '11 you got a mid-teens rate. Again as a reminder, SCIEX came in kind of low double-digits, and Molecular Devices was breakeven.
Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And just maybe to follow up on the gross margin strength, the G&A headcount only up 2% and that sort of thing. Are we kind of at the max sweet spot of revenue recovery but costs not coming back? Obviously, you worked hard to get costs out, you're going to work hard to make sure they don't come back. But is there some just natural operational headwind on margins relative to what may be just a naive incremental margin-type analysis would lead you to expect?
Daniel Comas: Well, we posted over 200 basis points of core margin improvement across the company in '10. I don't think we're expecting anything in that range going into '11. But our historical level of 75 basis points of core margin expansion, or maybe a little bit more, particularly in some of the newer businesses, I think we're well positioned for. And a little bit of growth on that 50%, now 51% gross margin does naturally get very good fall through. That's why one of the reasons we upped our kind of historical fall-through from 30% to 35%. And in the fourth quarter, we were not at the 50% we were at the first three quarters, but we were still running -- if you strip out some of the incremental restructuring, we're still about 40% in the fourth quarter, so kind of mid-30% still feels right going to '11.
Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And then just finally, Larry, on the M&A front, it would appear that perhaps, certainly the opportunity to do larger things is out there, larger things could hit in the radar screen, I just wonder if you could kind of comment on that? Is there a different threshold for something large, the state of the competition in larger things, maybe both strategically? And a story yesterday about Carlyle and KKR bringing back covenant light deals, I mean, private equity getting out of hand yet, just a little bit more granularity on how to think about that.
H. Culp: Yes. Well, Jeff, as you know, there are going to be times in the deal cycle whether it be PE or maybe with certain strategics around certain spaces, where pricing is going to get out of hand. I think we've tended to take to the sidelines when that happens, but still be active given the array of opportunities and spaces that we play in. I think for us, whether it's a small deal or a large transaction, however you want to define that, our methodology is typically the same. We first try to sort through the strategic questions relative to the attractiveness of the space, the industry, the market. I think secondly, we try to assess the strength of the particular company that we might have an interest in, in that context. Obviously, we then sort through what's our value add. How does DBS make a difference in that situation? And then obviously, getting back to valuation, how the deal might have to work. Clearly, with a smaller transaction, we can take a little bit more risk, if you will. For a larger situation, we'd have tremendous conviction around the answers to all of those questions. I think that's really as simple and as straightforward as I can describe it to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll try back to Mr. O'Callaghan with Nomura.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: So just on the first quarter, I mean, you mentioned the one less selling day. I mean other than the tougher comp, I mean is there anything, any dynamics that you're thinking about in terms of what you would expect to kind of moderate sequentially versus what you saw in 4Q?
H. Culp: Well, I think the way it's likely to play out, Shannon, is I think T&M once again should lead the pack. I would suspect they'll be up low double-digits, with that being pretty well broad-based. I think Industrial will be up double-digit as well, probably right around 10%, with Motion up a little bit more than Product ID. I think the rest of the group will follow. I think we talked about in New York, Gilbarco's got some tough comps given the payment upgrade cycle that they benefited from in 2009. Certainly, at Leica particularly, we saw some positive stimulus out of China and Japan early last year that I don't think is going to be there. But by the same token, given the way things ended and the way things started, those are some businesses where we probably have a little bit more upside than we were anticipating a month ago. So I think all in all, again, we're going to start off well here. I suspect, if we're looking at 6% to 8% for the year, we'd probably use that range, we're talking about being at the high end of that range here at quarter's end.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: On Product ID, I mean, the Esko deal is pretty interesting, kind of get's you branching out a little bit from the core of what you've kind of done in Product ID. I mean, can you talk about how you're thinking about that platform and the directions you might take it? I mean, does it got the potential to get much bigger as a part of Danaher or is it still sort of the same plans you've had before?
H. Culp: Well, I would respond, Shannon, by saying that our intent there has always been on par with the other core growth platforms. Admittedly, we've been more successful building out some of the others, both around the core position and in some adjacent spaces. But it's not for the lack of trying. I think what you see the team doing here with Esko is bringing in a nice-sized business with upgrades. Our portfolio clearly gives us some exposure in a business that is clearly adjacent to Videojet, but plugs in to a number of the macro drivers around creative and secure packaging, more sophisticated supply chains and the like, let alone the analog-to-digital conversion that's happening in packaging design that we try to play, obviously at Videojet and Links, and would like to play or plug into in some other businesses. So it would be a space that I would continue to watch. We want this team to get Esko onboard, get that integration off to a good start. But I'd like to see us put some of that capital we've talked about deploying this year into Product ID for sure.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: Just one follow-up question on the portfolio side. I mean, what's your willingness, given all the discussion on M&A, to deploy equity? How high a level of conviction? Is this something that investors should take seriously or not, for some of the larger deals that are being discussed out there?
Daniel Comas: Steve, I mean, as you know through our history, our very strong bias has been to use our free cash flow and a modest amount of leverage to fund our acquisitions. It's hard to think of a compelling situation where the lion's share, the purchase price, would be funded with equity. But if it's a situation like a Tektronix at that time where maybe we funded 10% or 15% of the purchase price after the fact with some equity, in part to keep our kind of Tier 1 commercial paper rating, I think we'd be willing to do that. And wouldn't rule out something bigger but it'd be a really high bar to think of a deal, where we're putting 50% of the price in terms of equity. At that point, it would almost be a kind of merger of equals anyway. And I don't think -- we have a lot of those we're working on. On the margin, could we issue equity, a small slice of the deal? Yes. But I'd be surprised if it's much more than that.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And little bit more on the quarter. I know you've discussed the first quarter sales guidance at the high end of the 6% to 8% range. But as I look at comps across the year and think about the fact that you're starting at -- after the first quarter, first quarter, your comping 6% I think, core, then 13% to 14% for the next three quarters. I would've thought that to hit that 6% to 8% for the full year, you would've had to have a much stronger first quarter. So am I missing something on this? Do you just see such acceleration that's going to overwhelm the comp?
H. Culp: Steve, I think that...
Daniel Comas: Steve, I mean, one way to -- I mean as you suggested we think it'd be at the high end of the range based on what were seeing right now. If you compared the fourth quarter, where we were plus 13%, the previous year, we were down 8%. So now were talking about being plus 8% but we're comparing versus 5.5% a year ago. So that alone is showing some sequential -- we have a much tougher comp in Q1 than we did in Q4 by 13 points. And we're only talking about it, a decel [deceleration], if you will, of going from plus 13% to about a plus 8%. It's early, we're off to a good start and we just see a lot of momentum.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And last on R&D, I noticed just a slight sequential downtick, and I'm assuming sales investment was up for the quarter, given your G&A comments, with 6.2%, from I guess 6.4%. Where do you see those two line items go, particularly as you continue to hold down G&A in the year?
H. Culp: I think when we talk about holding down G&A, Steve, we're really talking about holding down G&A, not necessarily R&D. But I think as we look into the budgets for this year, we're clearly continuing to invest in innovation. I think the sequential change that you're referring to does show a downtick with the ratio, but my notes show us up about $20 million sequentially in the spend in the fourth quarter. And I would expect we'll continue to sequentially put incremental funds in to drive growth if not in '11, obviously from an R&D perspective, more in '12 and '13. For us, given the nature of the projects, you're going to -- that number's going to be moving around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Project ends, maybe some third-party consulting slides off, but I think over time, you'll continue to see that ratio as a percentage, year in, year out, I think continue to move gradually northward given the nature of the businesses that dominate the portfolio now and the way we're trying to put as much as we can into innovation.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And is that true also on the sales investment side?
H. Culp: For sure. Obviously, the bulk of the sales and marketing investments are going into emerging markets, more so than the developed markets where the incremental sales person, the incremental service person, while getting more expensive each year, is still a relative bargain compared to the U.S. and Europe.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Wood with Jefferson Company.
Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So Larry, on the Dental equipment franchise, you did quite a bit better than I think you had communicated as soon as a month ago. Was there a material tax incentive, kind of flush in that business in the fourth quarter? And then just comment vis-ï¿½-vis next year, I mean, do you expect that kind of momentum to continue in '11?
H. Culp: Jon, I think at year's end, there were a number of things of that came together for us. But I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. The Dental business for a whole host of reasons tends to, particularly on the equipment side, tends to finish strong in normal times. And to us, both in the U.S. and in Europe, things just became more normal almost with each passing month. Obviously, given our position in imaging and virtually every modality, we were well placed to benefit from that increased investment in practices that the docs were making. I think as we look at '11, certainly I don't think we're talking about equipment being up low doubles all year long. I think it's going to be more of a mid-, possibly, a mid-plus-type grower for us. But again, because of how we're positioned, I think, we're looking forward to a good year. I think we'll be more active internationally. We flagged that for you back in December, obviously, with the IDX show coming up in Europe, it will be a flurry of new product launches there. I think, to the extent, as I referenced on the call, Sybron gets to back to a more normal run rate, and the two of those businesses do more together and do it effectively, we should have a good year in '11 in Dental on both sides of the house.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: I know we touched on the capital already a couple of times on the call today. I was hoping we could true that up. I know in December, you talked about a $4 billion number, but we had some puts and takes with divestiture of Pac Sci that was like $550 million, and after tax, you had the investment in EskoArt. So if we look at the debt capacity and free cash flow, it looks, by our calculation, still to be significantly above that $4 billion number that got discussed earlier. So I was hoping we could true that up.
Daniel Comas: Well, Deane, I mean, obviously we don't forecast acquisitions. We put out a kind of a proxy number that's somewhat -- with a primary constraint sort of being credit rating, the net after tax proceeds we expect from PSX is probably $100 million, $125 million more than we expect to pay for Esko. We did end up the year with stronger free cash flow. We've been talking about, I don't know $1.7-plus billion, we ended up with almost $1.9 billion in free cash flow. So we ended up with more cash in the bank at the end of the year. So net-net, I mean, if we had to give a number today, it would be slightly higher than the $4 billion. But directionally, I still think it's a reasonable framework for us to be communicating.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Where's the pressure point in terms of maximum debt? I mean we're in a low interest rate environment, but is it the A1/P1 on the commercial paper or is it the A2 rating, where's the pressure point for you?
Daniel Comas: Well, Deane, it's not a definitive pressure point, but we've been an A1/P1, CP-issuer for a dozen years. We like being in that zone particularly if things ever turn ugly, and at some point they will. Hopefully, not anytime soon. That's kind of the model that we have liked to work under.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: And potential divestitures, is there anything within the next year being contemplated? I know there's a standard -- there's no business as a permanent home at Danaher, but in terms of potential on the table divestitures, post the Pac Sci move, is there anything that you can share?
H. Culp: Deane, it sounds like you'll be disappointed, if I give you my normal answer.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: I've preempted that.
H. Culp: Well, you did, but I will stand by our tradition of not commenting on prospective acquisitions or divestitures. I think what we've done here with Pac Sci is a good move for the business. I think Meggitt will be a great partner and parent for them. I think it's a good move for Danaher as we, if you will, kind of bid those guys the best in bringing in Esko, which beefs up a strategic growth platform for us. Brings in, I think, a stronger higher growth, higher gross margin business with plenty of international opportunities. So stay tuned.
Matt McGrew: That's going to wrap up the Q&A for us. So Dan and I are around all day, anybody who wants to have any follow-up calls. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference. Thank you all for your participation.

H. Lawrence Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning everyone. We're pleased to report this morning an outstanding third quarter for Danaher. We grew 12.5% organically in the third quarter as the positive trends of July and August continued through September. Our core growth was broad-based across all the segments with professional instrumentation up 15.5%, industrial tech up 16.5%, and med tech up 7.5%. Our continuing commitment to drive our organic growth using VBS in the form of tools and processes to improve new product development and sales and marketing execution, as well as increased investments in those same areas, is evident in this strong core growth performance. We are quite pleased with this momentum and are optimistic about our potential to outperform for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.  We're winning in the marketplace and serving our customers well as we continue to capture market share in many of our businesses, including Leica, Radiometer, Hach Lange, Chem Treat, Kollmorgen, Fluke, and TEK Communications. Geographically, emerging markets were our best performer, up more than 20% in the quarter. Despite difficult comparisons to last year, China grew at a 25% rate in the quarter with our test and measurement, environmental, and Leica businesses leading the way. We also saw strong growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and India. Emerging markets now represent 20% of our total sales, up from 12% five years ago, representing a greater than 20% compounded annual growth rate. The U.S. grew low double digits and Europe was up 10%. The quality of our core growth was evident in the outstanding margin performance in the quarter, with our core operating margin improving 310 basis points year-over-year with each of our operating segments achieving at least 200 basis points of core improvement, a first for Danaher. In addition, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow in the quarter.  During the quarter we completed the strategic joint venture with Cooper Industries to combine our tools businesses to form Apex Tool Group. Beginning this quarter we deconsolidated the financial results of the businesses contributing to Apex and recorded our share of the combined joint venture results based on the equity method of accounting. We also recorded a $232 million after-tax gain in the quarter related to the formation of the joint venture. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we recorded third quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.95, up 79% year-over-year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which among other items excludes the $0.34 gain related to the formation of the Apex JB, was $0.60, up 33% year-over-year. Revenues for the quarter increased 16% to $3.2 billion, with core revenues up 12.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5% while acquisitions contributed 5% to sales growth.  Year-over-year gross margin for the third quarter increased 370 basis points to 51.7%, marking the first time in Danaher's history that we have achieved gross margins in excess of 50%. The year-over-year margin improvement is largely due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of our 2009 restructuring initiatives. Approximately 150 basis points of improvement in the quarter is attributable to the deconsolidation of our lower gross margin tools businesses. Operating margin in the third quarter increased year-over-year to 18%, resulting from higher sales volume and the benefit of our prior year's restructuring initiatives. Included in the operating results was $10.5 million in equity earnings contributed by Apex, which added approximately 35 basis points to our operating margin in the quarter. Absent the Apex contribution, our operating margin was 17.7%. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $1.5 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow year-to-date was $1.37 billion, and our free cash to net income conversion ratio was 104%. More meaningfully, excluding the after tax $232 million non-cash Apex gain, our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a robust 126%.  During the quarter we closed or signed two bolt on acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $200 million, which are expected to strengthen our test and measurement platform.  The M&A environment remains very active, very attractive, and given our strong balance sheet we believe we currently have more than $4 billion of M&A capacity over the next four to six quarters to expand and strengthen our portfolio with particular focus on our five growth platforms. Now turning to our operating segments, professional instrumentation revenues increased 20.5% for the quarter, with core revenues up 15.5%. Operating margin for the third quarter increased 560 basis points to 21.2%, primarily due to higher sales volume and the benefit of the prior year's restructuring initiatives. Our core operating margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter. Our environmental platform revenues increased 13% in the quarter, with core revenues up 10.5% Water quality core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter and Hach Lange core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate with solid demand across all geographies in our core lab and process instrumentation markets. During the quarter, Hach launched the SC 200 universal controller, which provides maximum flexibility for water analytics by eliminating the need for multiple dedicated controllers and offering plug and play capabilities with all of Hach's digital sensors currently covering 15 different testing parameters, such as ammonia, chlorine, and nitrate. Trojan core revenues declined at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, as a difficult year-over-year comparison resulting from the New York City drinking water installation more than offset solid growth in industrial, residential, and other municipal applications. However, year-on-year bookings were up double digits in the quarter. Earlier this month, Trojan unveiled its most advanced open channel wastewater UV disinfection system to date, the Trojan UV Signa. The Signa is specifically designed for large scale disinfection applications, making the conversion to UV disinfection easier by reducing the total footprint required, simplifying maintenance, and lowering the total cost of ownership. And Signa is three times more energy efficient than similar offerings. At Chem Treat, third quarter core revenues were up high single digits, with broad based growth across all major verticals. Since acquiring the business in mid-2007, we have increased sales force headcount by approximately 20%, as we continue to dynamically allocate resources to fund their successful sales growth model. Gilbarco [Veeder Root's] third quarter core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate year-over-year, with robust demand for outdoor payment solutions and dispensers globally. Earlier this month, Veeder Root introduced a key product for biofuels called the Phase-Two Water Detector, the first and only solution to continuously monitor underground storage tanks and detect ethanol-blended fuel phase separation, which can occur when water finds its way into tanks, often leading to infrastructure corrosion at the service station and costly damage to vehicle engines if undetected. Moving to test and measurement, revenues increased 32.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 22.5%. Fluke core revenues increased at a high teens rate in the quarter, with solid demand in all major geographies for thermography and our industrial products.  We unveiled a series of new products in the quarter, including the 381 Remote Display Clamp Meter, the first clamp meter with a detachable remote display and flexible current probe for easier, faster, and safer measurements. The wireless display featured on the 381 is similar to that on the 233 digital multimeter, which we introduced last year and displayed at our year end conference. This product advancement has been very well received in the field, with the 233 digital multimeter receiving 12 industry awards since introduction 10 months ago. Tektronix core revenues grew more than 30% in the quarter, led by demand for our oscilloscopes, bench instruments, and video test products. All major geographies were up double digits, led by China and Japan, which are both up over 40% year-on-year. Subsequent to quarter end we entered into an agreement to acquire Keithley Instruments. Keithley designs and develops electronic instruments and systems geared toward specialized needs of engineers and electronics manufacturers and academic institutions for research, product development, high performance production testing, and process monitoring. Keithley's instruments are expected to complement Techtronix efforts in distribution channels alongside Fluke and strengthen our general purpose test product offering, a key strategic initiative of the business. This acquisition, expected to be completed during the fourth quarter, is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and adoption of the merger agreement by Keithley's shareholders. Core revenues from our Fluke Networks and TEK Communications businesses collectively grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, with solid demand for both our core enterprise tools at Fluke Networks and our network management solutions at TEK Communications, including our new GeoProbe G10 platform, designed to optimize service for high bandwidth broadband telecom networks. During the quarter we acquired Arbor Networks, which develops a market network security and management solution for cyber-attack detection and mitigation for wireless carrier networks and next-generation data centers. Network security is an attractive and important market adjacency for TEK Communications. It's helping secure the communications networks we monitor, strengthening our value proposition. Moving to medical technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 31% compared to the prior year period, with core revenues up 7.5%. Med Tech core operating margin for the third quarter increased 330 basis points on a year-over-year basis as a result of higher sales volumes and the benefit of restructuring initiatives implemented last year. Our overall operating margin of 12.6% was up 450 basis points sequentially from the second quarter.  Our dental platform revenues increased 10% in the quarter, with core revenues up 6%. Cable revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, with particularly healthy demand for our imaging products including both 3D and intraoral sensors as well as our treatment unit and hand piece instruments. Sales expanded in most major geographies, led by the U.S. and Asia. In addition to the strong organic growth, core operating margins were up meaningfully in the quarter, and we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive growth and margin expansion for the remainder of 2010 and beyond. [Sybron] core sales grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, with strong sales in orthodontia solutions and infection prevention products offset by lower sales of general dental consumables due to inventory destocking in our U.S. distribution channels. The inventory destocking issue is now behind us, and we expect to return to historical growth rates in the fourth quarter. Moving to life sciences and diagnostics, revenues increased 54.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 10%. Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, with robust demand for both our advanced staining core histology systems and consumables. We saw double-digit growth across all major geographies, led by China and Japan, and we believe we are growing faster than the market in both histology and advanced staining. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, driven by sales of compounding stereo microscopes in the U.S. and China. We continue to be very pleased with the customer response to our SCN400 slide scanner, which enables Leica to offer its customers a complete digital scanning solution designed to store, manage, and analyze digital images addressing customer requirements and offering a compelling value proposition. At Radiometer, core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by solid demand for our blood gas instruments and consumables in North America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. The early customer feedback to the new ABL90 FLEX has been very favorable, and in August we received regulatory approval in the U.S., opening up, obviously, a significant market for future growth. The ABL80 FLEX which is targeted more for the emerging markets, also continues to do well in the market. We continue to be pleased with the results from AB SCIEX in molecular devices. The commercial and technical integration of the businesses is coming together, and in particular the AB SCIEX team is very energized by the success of their new Triple TOF 5600 mass spectrometer. Customer adoption of the 5600 has been progressing well, with one of our first wins at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, a leading proteomics research institution. In July, AB SCIEX announced a collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve hormone testing. This collaboration is intended to support the CDC's hormone standardization project, for improving the reliability of lab results used to help assess disease risk and monitor treatment. At Molecular Devices, growth in the core plate reader business has been solid, complemented in the quarter by the launch of the FilterMax and SpectraMax plate reader technology acquired earlier this year.  Moving to industrial technologies, revenues increased 19.5% for the quarter, with core revenues up 16.5%. Operating margin for the third quarter was 21.1%, a 410 basis point increase compared to the same period last year, due to the benefit of restructuring and cost initiatives implemented in 2009 as well as the higher sales volume in the segment. Our core operating margin increased 270 basis points in the quarter. Product identification revenues were up 20% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 16%, with strength in both instruments and consumables, and across all major product categories. Growth in the emerging markets and Europe was particularly strong. Videojet's product innovation, coupled with their global go to market investments, are driving this strong growth performance. Motion revenues were up 22% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 26.5%. We experienced significant growth in all major geographies and markets, with particularly good results in industrial automation, led by electronic assembly and mobile off highway. Sales of Kollmorgen's AKM and AKD motors and drives have been robust throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. We believe we are capturing market share and ended the third quarter with record bookings for the platform. Finally, moving to tools and components, revenues for the quarter decreased 53% due to the impact of the Apex Tool joint venture. Core revenues for the remaining businesses were up 5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.2%, an increase of 1160 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily due to including the equity contribution from Apex in the segment results. So to wrap up, we were very pleased with our execution in the quarter. With DBS's ability to drive organic growth and margin expansion, and our increasing exposure to the higher growth emerging markets, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to outperform for the remainder of this year and beyond. Given the continued strength across our businesses, we will be taking the opportunity in the fourth quarter to accelerate some of our planned 2011 restructuring activities. We are initiating fourth quarter 2010 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.61 to $0.66, which at the midpoint represents the 13.5% increase year-over-year. For the full year 2010 we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance from the prior range of $2.16 to $2.23 to a new range of $2.25 to $2.30. 
Matt McGrew: Thanks Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions.] And we'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: This plus 50% gross margin is pretty exceptional as you said, but can you give us a sense of, and knowing we've got a little ways out to get to 2011, what's the sustainability? I know some of this is Apex, but I'm thinking kind of the non-Apex part of it, the sustainability of that type of a gross margin at this revenue level. Is there cost to come back to the system when you think about 2011 or any other pricing issues that may impact that number?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think that we would view 50% with this portfolio as something that it would be sustainable over time. Obviously we'll bring different businesses in above and below that number. I suspect that we'll alter the mix, but if you look at the core underlying drivers here, the deconsolidation of Apex is probably worth, what, 115 basis points. So we would have been north of 50% even without that dynamic.  I just think you look at so much of professional instrumentation, so much of what we do in med tech and even the margin improvement we've seen in industrial technologies all contributing to that high gross margin, and I think that as you've seen in the third quarter and as we're alluding to in the fourth quarter, we can sustain that while, and in part because of, the acceleration in both the cost restructuring activities as well as some of the growth investments. So I don't think this is a high water mark never to be seen again. I think it's something this portfolio and this team is very capable of delivering.
Scott Davis: Okay, that's kind of what I was trying to get at. Now can we move to AB SCIEX, because it's obviously a very important business when you think as far as forward earnings are concerned. You didn't mention much on it in the conference call. Can you give us an update on the integration and how things are going there.
H. Lawrence Culp: Sure. We're very pleased with where we are here through three quarters at AB SCIEX. I think we're going to continue to see this business deal with the important but unexciting work of getting the two halves of the business stitched together. It's important for us in a lot of ways, certainly for investors, as we do that we pull costs out of the business, both one-time costs and unnecessary costs. I think you see that in the improved med tech margins. Clearly with the introduction and now the shipment of the 5600 we're out aggressively in the marketplace with technology reinforcing that technology leadership position that AB SCIEX enjoys.  I think we're looking here at a second half where the team is well-positioned to deliver high single-digit growth and get back to those double-digit operating margins that we knew this team was capable of. So I think all and all while it's still early, and a lot goes into the first year with any new Danaher acquisition, particularly an undertaking as significant as this, we feel very good about where that business is and where that business is headed, more importantly going forward.
Scott Davis: Just real quick, KaVo, it looks like we've turned the corner her. Can you just give us a sense of the profit profile? A) Are you making money in KaVo, and B) with this mid-single-digit organic volumes and the restructuring that you've done how does this kind of match up to the rest of the segment?
Daniel Comas: Scott, it's still below the rest of the segment, but as you know this business was break-even last year. We'll do mid-single-digits this year and exit even higher than that. I think right now we are targeting with sort of mid-single-digit growth a high single-digit rate, OP rate maybe even 10% next year, and that's including some additional restructuring next year as well to then position us again for 2012 for another lift in those margins. So we're very pleased with the progress. We've taken longer than we should have, but very pleased about where we are right now with KaVo.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: A lot of questions. Larry, you mentioned the market share gains, and you zipped by those pretty quickly. Maybe just go back over them and then talk broadly about what we might expect in some of the other businesses.
H. Lawrence Culp : Sure. I think that there are a number of places, Bob, where we're doing particularly well. We've had the opportunity in the last 90 days to be out with everybody as part of our strategic reviews. Just go across the portfolio, Hach Lange is doing very well broadly speaking. Clearly the step up in investment in emerging markets in China and beyond China I think is serving them very well. Particularly at Leica Biosystems, with what they do in the histopathology lab, particularly the investments we've made around the advanced staining system. That continues to drive very good growth for us.  Very pleased at Radiometer. We talked in the prepared remarks about the ABL90 and the ABL80 are two point of care [inaudible] blood gas instruments that have been introduced and doing well. AQT, our cardiac platform, had a very strong step up sequentially in the third quarter as well. Clearly DEXIS and the rest of the imaging platform is doing very well on a relative basis.  Chem Treat we've talked about. They continue to move right along. I highlighted Kollmorgen in the prepared remarks. We don't often talk about Kollmorgen, but what they've done with their new motor and drive platforms, the AKM and the AKD, we think they're doing very well in certain industrial verticals where they focus.  So I could go on and on. I'll stop rambling, but I think this is really the culmination of a lot of work the team's done to improve our execution capability and overfund those opportunities we think warrant that sort of support.
Robert Cornell: A lot of questions. But I guess the thing that caught my attention is your comment, again you said the $4 billion of potential strategic money to be deployed and you gave a pretty explicit four to six quarter. What we glean from that with regard to acquisition activity?
H. Lawrence Culp : I don't think that we're saying anything more, Bob, than what we've said through the course of the year. We're well-positioned to continue to be an active strategic acquirer of businesses that we think strengthen our portfolio, particularly with our growth platforms in mind, investments that we think not only strengthen and built out Danaher, but will generate strong returns for shareholders. Clearly we see this current environment as one where there is plenty of opportunity. We continue to be quite busy. I don't think anyone should be surprised to see us put some serious capital to work in the short to medium term. That's not a forecast, but just a look into the pipeline and a look to the balance sheet and obviously a strong vote of confidence in our bandwidth to tackle capital deployments on that scale.
Robert Cornell: Final question from me. What's a comment on the Apex contribution to '11 in terms of accretion and dilution at this point? Do you have any better view of the synergies and the outlook there now?
Daniel Comas : Bob, it will probably still be mildly diluted next year. The venture is spending a fair amount of money right now to go after some costs and also some growth investment. That will probably continue through the first half of '11. So maybe when we get to the back half it's probably neutral and then we would expect that in 2012 the venture would be accretive for us.
Operator: We'll move on to Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.
Deane Dray - Citi Investment Research: I was hoping we could go through some color regarding the fourth quarter guidance, especially if you could frame expectations regarding poor revenue growth. You're up against still some easier comps, but the idea here is there's upside this quarter and how much does that carry through in the fourth. And then if I caught it correctly it sounded like you're moving some restructuring actions that would have been done in 2011 into the fourth quarter and just frame for us where you expect to do restructuring and what type of payback at this stage you'd be expecting.
H. Lawrence Culp : Sure. Let me talk to some of those points. First, I would just say that the comp does get more challenging in the fourth quarter. We really saw the tide come back by this point last year. We obviously had a better fourth quarter compared to the other quarters last year come year's end. But that said, I think that as we look out toward the rest of the year, on a core basis we should be up high single digits. I wouldn't rule out 10% given the strength of the markets and I think our performance in them, certainly test and measurement and motion are likely to continue to lead the way. I like a lot of what we're seeing. I like Biosystems right now. I think they're poised to do well in the quarter. Product ID as well is positioned to do well.  So I think high single digits, possibly 10 would be where I'd call the top. We are going to step up in the fourth quarter our quiet restructuring and related activity. We intend to put $10 million to $15 million a quarter into improving our cost structure and obviously accelerating growth and investments as well. I suspect we could be up two, maybe three times that amount in the fourth quarter given the room I think we will have to make those sorts of investments both in improving our cost structure, to get a jump on 2011, but also frankly there are some things we can pull forward that will be good growth investments, getting us ready for 2011 as well.  So a combination. And I guess what I'm really flagging there for you Deane is we obviously had great follow-through in the third quarter on close to 45%. I think we're going to be down with 35% to 40% on the back of those investments in the fourth quarter, but still I think a very good outlook for us as we get ready for next year.
Deane Dray: Do just maybe stating the obvious, this is very different from the proactive restructuring that we saw you all take in the early stages of 2008. This is all done from what I would characterize as a position of strength, just being opportunistic here?
Daniel Comas : I think that's a good, accurate description. Given the strength we saw in the middle of the third quarter, the way it continued, we really went out to the businesses and said we think we're going to have an opportunity here in Q4 to pull forward some of the stuff that the businesses were contemplating to do in 2011. And as Larry mentioned, we've green-lighted a fair amount of that. Depending on how the quarter plays out we might do a little bit more than that. It is pretty broad-based across the segments, and I think it will give us a head start getting into '11.
Deane Dray: And just last one from me. Any comment on how pricing contributed in the quarter?
Daniel Comas : It was pretty consistent with what we've seen in the first two quarters, about 0.75% of price. Working on some areas to get that up maybe a little bit higher going into '11, but not a lot of changes.
Deane Dray: And that's all on the back of new products?
Daniel Comas : New products and typically what we get with consumables.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just a question on some of the dynamics that happened this year and maybe a look forward a bit. Is there anything unusual that you think about in driving this year that's going to lead to a tougher comp? I know there's big projects that come through on water sometimes. Anything that we need to be aware about on a go-forward basis? And then second of all, there's been a lot of chatter in the medical community around hospitals seeing weaker patient volumes and it just seems like there's a little bit of risk around the hospital cap ex front in medical, and maybe you could just address those concerns as well.
Daniel Comas : In terms of any macro items to the businesses in 2011, nothing jumps to light. We've had two very strong years at Gilbarco Veeder Root. Some of the things were regulatory driven over the last couple of years. So that could be our toughest comp going into next year. And then the other items that companies are talking about vis-a-vis pension, we don't have a lot there, but it will probably be a little bit of an incremental headwind given the lower discount rate that I think everyone's going to have to use going into '11. And then some of the noise and some of the changes on the tax law will be a modest incremental headwind going into '11.
H. Lawrence Culp : Steve, with respect to some of the hospital-based pressures I think it's important to keep in mind that what we call med tech - obviously now our largest segment - half of that is dental, not really a hospital-based business, largely a private pay market in most parts of the world. And the other side, what we call life sciences has I think pretty good balance between both its clinical exposure, research, and in the applied space like food and water. In the clinical space specifically, I think the growth that you're seeing that's delivered both at Radiometer, where we've very focused on critical care, which is a tough thing to cut back on - when you need to go to the emergency room, you need to go - as well as what we're doing in pathology, particularly around oncology, with Leica Biosystems. They're our two leading growth engines right now and I think they are performing well against a current backdrop of some of those hospital pressures that you've talked about. So I don't think that anyone is necessarily immune, but we're very well-positioned to work our way through that. 
C. Stephen Tusa: And then one last question. I don't recall you guys mentioning acquisitions in your press release before on a quarter, which is usually a pretty succinct statement in a press release. Are you guys having trouble finding acquisitions of size? Despite it being a nice, high return bolt on, is the size of Keithley indicative of what you guys are seeing, or is there just a lack of opportunity on the bigger sized deals? Is that why we're not seeing those recently?
H. Lawrence Culp : I would characterize the pipeline much as I have in the past, chock full of opportunity, both larger and smaller than Keithley. I think in a typical year or so you're going to see us do a number of deals in and around that [$100 million plus] range, a la Keithley. Ten to a dozen it will be smaller, and then one or two that will be materially bigger. That's, again, not a forecast for calendar 2010, but that tends to be what happens in a typical 12-month period. So we continue to be optimistic about our ability to deploy capital, not that the balance sitting there basically generating no income is an issue for us, but we just see a lot of good opportunities to strengthen the quality of this portfolio over the cycle, and we intend to do that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Just first, on core growth exit rates, you had talked about up at the tech conference that was going on in July and August and we see the final results here. But are you seeing a continued acceleration through September, and which businesses are you seeing the fastest growth over the last month?
Daniel Comas : We talked in September that July and August were very strong. We did not see any change in September. I'm not saying it got faster, but the very healthy pace of orders continued pretty evenly throughout the quarter. It's broad-based. If you think about where we were in July, arguably the biggest lift came in med tech. In med tech we were looking at a 5% quarter in July, and we came out at 7.5%. Both Radiometer and Leica Bio, which Larry alluded to, we thought they would be very good quarters and they were even better than that. I think the double-digit growth we saw at KaVo was a little better than we thought was going to occur in the quarter, and Cybron sort of bouncing back to positive growth also helped that segment.
Steven Winoker: And internally, when you start talking about what's driving that growth to give you confidence going forward, how much are you thinking is due to the new product introductions that you're talking about in every call as opposed to other factors, sales force initiatives, etc.? Do you think about how to think about each of those?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think it's hard to give you a macro answer, because the contribution, or the breakdown, various business by business. Certainly new products were an important part of our story, both on an absolute and a relative basis. I think clearly new products help drive market share, but the investments we've been making on the margin have been weighted toward emerging markets. That gives us that mix benefit if you will.  And again, I think there's just a lot of energy the last several years behind our DBS growth investments around new product development and sales and marketing execution. Even if we're just out selling something that may be three or four or five years old, having more people out being more effective in terms of how we generate leads, how we prepare those sales people to get in front of customers and help them solve their problems is really all part of the mix. So I wish I had a better topside answer for you, but it's really, again, a mix of a whole host of different efforts, business by business, that come together to drive this performance.
Steven Winoker: Last time you talked about the supply chain challenges and those being the biggest operating challenges out there. What are you seeing there in terms of constraints, electronics, elsewhere? And also maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of material and wage dynamics?
Daniel Comas : Larry and I were just talking about supply chain yesterday, and it was noteworthy as we did our reviews across the businesses for the third quarter and their monthly president's letters, the lack of discussion about supply chain issues. So it feels like it's gotten better across a number of our businesses. In other words, the supply chain, particularly in the electronics area. I wouldn't say it's totally caught up to date, but the issues we were having in the first half have really died down. We don't have a lot of exposure to materials, to commodities. It's really more really in the joint ventures today where they have some of that exposure. In terms of wage inflation, clearly we're seeing that in the emerging markets, and that is a challenge, both from a cost perspective but also from a retention perspective.
Steven Winoker: And then just one last technical question. In the goodwill walk in the 10Q, had $174 million of write down, and it was associated with dispositions in JV formation. Am I correct in assuming that was all, or almost all, the JV? Or was it other parts of the business where you were writing things down?
Daniel Comas : It was in JV.
Operator: [Operator Instructions.] We'll move on to John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: So maybe a question for Dan. I was wondering, could we get a little more color around the run rate through the second half - the incremental investment spending you guys had articulated in the first half that you were going to make? I'm assuming that the extra restructuring you're doing in the fourth quarter - it's about $0.06 - is discrete, right? There was no extra restructuring, if you will, in the third quarter. Where do we stand? I see your R&D was 6.4% but some of that I think you called out associated with the JV. Can you just walk us through those two buckets and how to think about that heading into next year?
Daniel Comas : Maybe first on the restructuring side and the incremental growth side. We've been going through our normal quiet restructuring, which Larry alluded to - the $10+ million a quarter. We're going to be stepping up that in the fourth quarter.  On the growth investing side, particularly when you have 12%-13% organic growth, we could be [fall through] at 5% given the contribution margins and number of our businesses, particularly in places like Med Tech. And I think that scaled down, a kind of 40%-45% [fall through] gives you a sense of the step up for the investment.  R&D is clearly keeping pace with our growth rate, so we're growing R&D at a double-digit rate in almost all of our businesses. You're also seeing the step up in the sales and marketing, particularly in the feet on the street investment. Both [inaudible], particularly in the emerging markets as well as in a number of cases, converting distribution in emerging markets to direct.  So I'm not sure I can roll it all up for you and give you a number, but we've had a substantial step up in the investment, both in the R&D and the go to market through the first nine months of the year.
John Inch: Are you actually accelerating that then, Dan, as you roll into next year, or are we going to be at a steady state by the fourth quarter as you roll into 2011?
Daniel Comas : Some of this step up in investment in the fourth quarter will be on the growth side. That's going to be converting some distribution to direct. We're also stepping up some kind of a web-based marketing, go-to-market activities. We're probably pretty close to a run rate but again, there'll be some incremental step up here in Q4.
John Inch: Philosophically, Larry, when you first embarked upon building your medical businesses the market had valued healthcare significantly higher. Debatably your stock may have lagged a little bit because of your healthcare exposure, but you obviously looked to doing further deals. What is your appetite since getting further down the medical path? Would you look a little bit more favorably toward industrial? I'm just thinking of strategically how you're weighing these things philosophically.
H. Lawrence Culp : I think when we got into med tech five years ago we were very focused strategically on avoiding some of the risk factors that get a lot of coverage today. Risk factors such as reimbursement, single payer dynamics, let alone certain situations where competition is quite fierce. And I think that's really why you see us with the med tech segment that we have today, dental having its own discrete dynamics.  We're now very much a market leader in life sciences and diagnostics. We've gone into some niche areas, be it in critical care or in histopathology on the diagnostic side with Leica and SCIEX, some targeted research applications with very good applied market exposure, like food and environmental. So I don't think we have any regrets whatsoever.  I think all these adds have represented over the last five years incremental positives for the Danaher portfolio, and our potential to drive the top, the bottom, and the cash flow through cycles. And I think as we go forward if we deploy that capital we alluded to earlier over the next year or so please don't be surprised to see us continue to invest and hopefully invest smartly in med tech. Not exclusively, because we still want to do things in T&M and environmental, product I.D. as well, but we have lost none of our courage or our conviction about those opportunities.
John Inch: In other words, think of a bit of a portfolio balance, then, right? Is that the way to think about it?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think that's what you see today. If med tech was a company unto itself, again because of that research, that clinical, that applied market balance, it would be a steady ship in any possible storm.
Operator: Moving on to Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Just wanted to go back to restructuring. So it looks like you're talking about $0.04 of restructuring. Just want to clarify a few points. First of all, that's been absorbed within the guidance you've given this morning?
H. Lawrence Culp : Correct.
Daniel Comas : That's correct.
Nigel Coe: And then secondly, you said pulling through some of the actions for 2011, does that mean you're still going to do the $10 million to $12 million for the quarter?
Daniel Comas : Correct. We'll have to obviously get into all the budgets, but the plan is to then pull forward stuff maybe later in '11 to early in '11.
Nigel Coe: Just wanted to clarify that point. And then if we go back to last quarter, obviously the med tech margins were below [inaudible] and you gave guidance of two points of improvement from 3Q to 4Q. You obviously got that four points in 3Q. Do you think you can improve margins in med tech from 3Q to 4Q?
Daniel Comas: Operationally, we can, but that will be a segment that will receive some of the restructuring, so I expect margins in med tech that would be probably a little bit better than Q3. But on, hopefully, an exit rate, better, and part of it being the favorable Q4 seasonality. [Ex to] restructuring you should see another nice step up in the restructuring, though, because of the restructuring but you won't actually see that in the reported number.
Nigel Coe: So it's fair to say that the bulk of the restructuring will go into med tech?
Daniel Comas: If we're talking $40 million plus of restructuring, that's over a 100 basis point margin across the business, and that will be med tech, professional instrumentation, and industrial tech.
Nigel Coe: And then looking at test and measurement core growth, obviously they're at very high levels. How does that decay? It looks like you've got weaker comps - comps get a little bit tougher but still fairly week comps going into 2Q '11. First of all could you address that and secondly, you've seen some weakening in semiconductor lead indicators, and you do have a [inaudible] exposure through these businesses. So you do view that as a negative for test and measurement?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think first in terms of the comps you're right, we should continue to have very good performance there if for no other reason than the comps. I think what we're finally seeing at Tek kick in is the R&D and go to market investments and [inaudible] improvements that they have laid in, which helps us. And I think frankly, despite some of the secular issues that you raised, I think this business is just flat out executing better on a global basis compared to where they were two years ago. We've got some portfolio moves here into sectors like video test. We've made a significant move into service. I think it bodes very well for Tek's ability to drive through some of those concerns. But in terms of what we're seeing it's really still quite buoyant at Tek and at Fluke right now.
Nigel Coe: And as we get into the second half of next year, in a more normalized environment, what sort of growth rate would you expect from test and measurements?
H. Lawrence Culp: I think if you look at that business all up it should be mid-single-digits plus.
Operator: Taking our next question that will come from 
Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Just a couple quick ones. Everything you just said on the quiet restructuring is pretty clear. I'm just wondering as you roll all that up is there any significant, then, restructuring benefit carryover into 2011 or just the issue of the cadence of the spending that you already talked about?
Daniel Comas : There will be some incremental positive from the step up of what we're doing here going into '11, but that's maybe a couple of pennies a share, $20 million to $30 million of incremental spend here in Q4 should get almost a one-to-one return in 2011
Jeffrey Sprague: And how about on thinking about deals, SCIEX in particular, but all the other smaller stuff you've rolled into the '10 base? As it stands now what kind of aggregated deal accretion do you look at in '11 versus '10?
Daniel Comas : I don't want to steal Larry's thunder in December. But clearly the biggest driver there should be SCIEX. With all the transition expense, the acquisition and accounting expense, it's probably a mid-single-digit pre-tax contributor here and we would expect a sizable step up there in 2011 as well as some of the recent test and measurement deals both [inaudible] network and Keithley being contributors, but again, I'll let Larry roll that up in December.
Jeffrey Sprague: And then just housekeeping, along the lines of rolling up, what do we do with the tools stub? Do you collapse it into industrial, or what's the game plan there?
Daniel Comas : Given how small the tools and components segment now is, we're in the process of evaluating the segments and I think in the near term will be modifying how we present the segments.
Operator: Moving on to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs : Just a couple of small cleanups. First, Dan, on the professional instrumentation margins revenue is up a little bit. Margin's down a little bit. Is that just mix essentially going on there in terms of the percent margin change there or is there something else to talk about there?
Daniel Comas : They were both 21% plus, I guess it's down sequentially very modestly. Q3 for Fluke tends to be a little bit lower margin seasonally, and we probably had some of that, but I could go back and look at that if you like, but I don't know off hand.
Terry Darling: It doesn't sound like there's anything significant there. And then on this 400 base point sequential improvement, you talked around it. I'll just ask a little bit more directly. It sounded like the life sciences piece was up more than 400 basis points sequentially, and dental was obviously up strong, but maybe a little less than that. Is that the right picture there?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think there were three or four contributing factors. One, the fact that the core growth came in at 7.5% for our guidance of 5% to 6% and the very high fall through we get in that segment. Two, KaVo being up over 400 basis points year-on-year, big contributor there. Leica was up over 200 basis points year-over-year, and then SCIEX, both the absence of some of the acquisition expenses as well as just core basis, a nice step up both in core growth but also our operating margin was the fourth factor that really helped drive the sequential improvement.
Terry Darling: And then on the core growth, I may have missed it for dental in the fourth quarter. The comp gets a little tougher. Does that stay in the upper singles, or did you indicate that's back to the mid singles?
Daniel Comas : We thought Cybron would accelerate from low singles to mid singles and KaVo, which was double, is probably going to be mid-single-digit to high-single-digit, in part because of the comp issue you referenced.
Operator: Moving on to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: I guess I'll take my two questions here. On the med tech side, just curious, when you're looking at the margins there, obviously we have some work to do and plenty of work to do at KaVo. How are Leica's margins relative to the consolidated med tech margin? Are we still managing that with growth investments? Are they still below the med tech overall margin?
Daniel Comas : They're low double-digit and we're still working that. As you know, when we bought it it was about a 4% or 5% OP business and we still believe ultimately that's high-teen contributor to the segment.
H. Lawrence Culp : Just to be clear, though, we think we can drive that margin expansion and continue to invest there. We're with that team next week in fact, in [inaudible]. [It's a balance that has thus far.]
Richard Eastman: Okay, but there's still plenty of investment opportunities and it's a matter of moving the cost directionally down but investing in the right spots. That's how we're basically managing the margin there?
Daniel Comas : Well, given the gross margin there, if we can just control and keep flat the G&A and the manufacturing expense we could see 100 basis points plus of margin improvement just from the fall through of the good organic growth we're getting there.
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay. And then Larry, just a question. Geographically as we pushed into the fall here when you look at the three major regions: U.S., Europe, and emerging markets including China, is there anything from a trend line perspective? Any of those three markets that you're particularly watching closely at this point, either a slow down or an acceleration?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think we watch them all. It's hard to take the 20%+ emerging market growth for granted, but having been on calls earlier in the week with both our China and our India teams they're still quite bullish about the near to medium term. We were very pleased with the U.S. being up low doubles as it were, and Europe coming in at 10%. If I had to pick one of the three that I'm probably most concerned about - though concern might be an overstatement - I'd probably pick Europe, just for all the macro factors that everybody else has been talking about. No particular insight or specific issue in mind there.
Operator: We'll move on to SunTrust, with Wendy Caplan asking a question.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust : You talked about sales increases in terms of feet on the street at Chem Treat and elsewhere. Can you talk about hiring for production workers, other categories like engineering, at this point?
H. Lawrence Culp : Certainly part of the step up in R&D that you see here is a function of hiring scientists, technologists, engineers, both for core technology development as well as new products. I don't have a specific number there for you, but obviously you see it in the P&L. I think that part of what you're seeing in the gross margins, in the BCMs is frankly very good execution on the shop floor relative to the restructuring coupled with the way we're tackling the step up in volume this year. So I know we do have an increase in our manufacturing headcount but it has been quite modest hence the productivity gains and in turn the variable margins.
Wendy Caplan: And Larry, are you hiring full time workers, or are you hiring temp workers? How should we think about that strategically?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think that it really is a business by business decision depending on the nature of the demand curves. I don't think we necessarily have a bias in one direction or another. For a lot of our businesses now it's also a global call in terms of where volumes are rising, let alone being handled from a production perspective.
Wendy Caplan: And one last one. You talk a lot in these calls about new products and new opportunities from those products. Size these for us. Are there any that you would call a "breakthrough" product for the company?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think that at this point in terms of a breakthrough product, many of these introductions move the needle for the respective businesses. Certainly the big product that AB SCIEX has launched is a game-changer for them - the 5600. No doubt about that. I think what you're seeing really in terms of the suite of products that have come out at Radiometer around the ABL90 FLEX, the ABL80 FLEX as well as AQT, pretty much a game-changer for them, and perhaps in turn for Danaher.  I wouldn't want to leave out bond introduction at Leica Biosystems because that's driving good growth, part of the results here today, but what we really haven't flagged yet, because we're building the install base, is the aftermarket consumables stream, much like Radiometer, that we are in the course of building as we build out that install base. That's a few years down the road still, but I think the more we shift the revenue mix at Leica toward consumables, the stronger the contribution that business will be making back in part to Rick's question. So again, I think all and all it's a business by business approach, and we've got a lot of good folks executing quite well on the new product introductions this year.
Operator: We do have time for one final question that will come from Jason
Jason Feldman - UBS: Earlier in the call you addressed the hospital budget situation, but when thinking about the other traditional life science customers, academic, pharma, industrial, do you have any view on how their budgets are going to look next year? Are they going to be the same, similar type of headwinds, or better, worse?
H. Lawrence Culp : I was pleased to read your note yesterday relative to the U.K. trends that looked more encouraging today than they might have earlier in the week. We're really in the process of pulling all of that together as Dan alluded to. We'll present our '11 views when we get together in December, but I think by and large when we talk about those non-clinical applications, be they research, be they applied, I think we're still of the view that both at Leica and at AB SCIEX particularly we're positioned for growth.
Jason Feldman: And then lastly, quickly on AB SCIEX, you've only had them for a couple of quarters. New product introductions seem to have been well received, but this is a business that had been losing share for quite some time. Have you noticed already a change in the trend from a market share perspective there? Or is it too early?
H. Lawrence Culp : I think with the 5600, that business growing at a high single-digit rate in the second half, frankly that's a rate that they had not enjoyed for some time and I'm not convinced the market is growing at that rate. So that has to translate at least mathematically into some share gain. And more importantly, frankly, than their share gain in any one quarter, that team is back on its toes. It's out in the market. It's a story that's going to take a while to write, but I really like where we are here as we get close to the year-one anniversary.
Operator: And that concludes the question and answer session. Mr. McGrew, I'll turn the conference over to you for any additional closing remarks.

H. Culp: Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning by giving some color around what we are seeing across our businesses and end markets to give you a framework for our solid second quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year.  We continue to see encouraging signs across the global economy. We grew 14% in the second quarter on a core basis. Our core growth was broad-based with Professional Instrumentation growth of 19%, Industrial Tech growth of 15.5% and Med Tech coming in up 4.5%. Our enhanced commitment over the last several years to organic growth, both in the form of the expansion of the Danaher Business System, as well as increased investments in new product developments and sales and marketing initiatives is evident in this solid core growth performance.  As a result of these efforts, we continue to capture market share in many of our businesses. Leica, DEXIS, Hach Lange, ChemTreat, Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we are taking market share.  Geographically, emerging markets were our best performers, up more than 25% in the quarter. Emerging markets now represent about 20% of total sales, up 16% from three years ago, representing a low teen compounded annual growth rate. The U.S. grew low double digits, and Europe was up high single digits. Given the recent headlines in Europe, we've been paying particular attention to that region. By and large, what we saw on the quarter suggested that our Western European business, which is largely dependent on Germany, France, the U.K. and the Nordics, is healthy. But we are again watching that space very carefully.  The quality of the core growth was evident in the outstanding margin performance in the quarter, with our core operating margin improving year-over-year by over 300 basis points, which, when combined with our sales growth, resulted in second quarter adjusted EPS up 40% over the prior year.  So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.55, up 25% year-over-year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.56, up 40% year-over-year. Our EPS performance reflects the 2-for-1 stock split, which took effect in June.  Revenues for the quarter increased 24% to a record $3.3 billion, with core revenues up 14%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1%, while acquisitions contributed 11% to sales growth. Year-over-year gross margin for the second quarter increased 230 basis points to 49.5%, largely due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of our 2009 restructuring initiatives.  Operating margin in the second quarter increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 16.1%, resulting from higher sales volumes and the benefit of our prior year's restructuring initiatives. Year-to-date, the operating cash flow was a record $932 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash was $839 million, and our free cash to net income conversion ratio was 125%. This outstanding cash flow performance is due principally to the quality of our growth and our team's solid execution on working capital.  During the quarter, we completed six bolt-on acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $60 million, strengthening our Test & Measurement, Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, and Sensors and Control businesses. We believe the M&A environment remains attractive, and we currently have more than $2 billion of additional M&A spending capacity to expand and strengthen our portfolio, and our obvious focus continues to be on our five growth platforms.  Now turning to our operating segments. Professional Instrumentation revenues increased 23% for the quarter, with core revenues up 19%. Operating margin for the second quarter increased 660 basis points to 21.7%, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior-year restructuring initiatives. Our core operating margin was up 440 basis points in the quarter. Our environmental platform revenues increased 18.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 15.5%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter. The Hach Lange core revenues grew to low teens rate with solid industrial demand for our lab and process instrumentation and consumables and improved demand from customers in the electronics industry.  Sales were strong across all major geographies, with particularly robust results across the emerging markets, which now represent almost 30% of the overall business. Trojan core revenues were up modestly in the quarter as the difficult year-over-year comparison resulting from the New York City drinking water installation project obscured solid growth elsewhere in the business. Demand was robust for industrial and residential applications, and we are very encouraged by the recent municipal bookings activity.  We recently launched our solo UV green technology solution, which offers our customers a strong value proposition, high ultraviolet output for disaffection with energy efficiency to reduce power consumption and their carbon footprint.  At ChemTreat, second quarter core revenues were up low double digits, with broad-based growth across all major industries and particular strength in our cooling water applications. We believe we continue to capture market share as we accelerate our investment in ChemTreat's go-to-market model, and we've been pleased with the early results from our expansion into Canada and Latin America.  Gilbarco Veeder-Root's second quarter core revenues increased more than 20% year-over-year, with sales at Gilbarco up double digits across all major product categories, partially offset by a decline at Veeder-Root due to a difficult year-over-year comparison with our 2009 California Vapor Recovery Program.  Customers continue to invest in our Passport Point-of-Sale systems and outdoor payment solutions in North America, while dispenser demand has been robust globally.  Moving to Test & Measurement. Revenues increased 32% in the quarter, with core revenues up 23%. Fluke core revenues increased more than 20% in the quarter, with solid demand in all major geographies for our core industrial and thermography products, including our new TiS, a thermal imager in the Building Diagnostics segment available at a sub-$3,000 price point.  European demand increased significantly from the prior quarter, driven by sales of our new Ti32 thermographer and overall strength in distribution. We've been particularly pleased with our go-to-market efforts in Eastern Europe, with additional feet on the street and channel expansion initiatives driving greater than 30% growth during the quarter.  In June, Fluke acquired the Ruska and Pressure Measurements (sic) [Ruska and Pressurements] product lines of Druck Inc. Based in Houston, the businesses provide high-performance solutions for pressure test and calibration applications, complementing Fluke's existing calibration offerings.  Tektronix core revenues grew more than 30%, led by robust global sales of oscilloscopes and other bench top instruments. All major geographies were up at least 25%.  In June, Huawei, one of China's largest telecom companies, presented Tektronix with its Best Supplier Award, selected from more than 15 under suppliers. The award was voted on by all Huawei purchasing and R&D technical selection committee members and recognizes TEK's outstanding pre-sales, after-sales and technical support.  For those captivated by the World Cup television coverage for the past month, you have Tektronix to thank for the quality of your viewing experience. Over $1.5 million of Tektronix waveform monitors and other video testers were used throughout the games by broadcasters and systems integrators to support the quality of programming and enhanced the viewer experience.  Tektronix augmented its R&D efforts with two important product line acquisition in the quarter. SyntheSys Research, based in Menlo Park, California, is a leading developer of bit error rate testing scopes, otherwise known as birth scopes, which perform high-speed signal integrity Test & Measurement analysis and largely sell into TEK's existing customer base.  Mixed Signals is a leading technology provider in the digital video and audio monitoring for digital television operators and media providers. This acquisition expands our presence in the attractive IP Internet protocol video Test & Measurement market, which continues to grow with the expansion of broadcast services requiring greater bandwidth and monitoring.  Core revenues for our Fluke Networks and TEK Communications businesses collectively grew to mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, with mid-teens growth of core enterprise solutions at Fluke Networks, partially offset by the timing of large mobile carrier network management installations at TEK Communications compared to the prior year. The rollout of our new GeoProbe G10 platform to address high-bandwidth interfaces, and data center applications continues to be well received by mobile operators and is expected to help drive growth for the remainder of this year.  Moving to Medical Technologies. Revenues for the quarter increased 31.5% compared to the prior-year period, with core revenues up 4.5%. Med Tech core operating margin for the second quarter increased 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis as a result of higher sales volumes and the benefit of restructuring initiatives implemented in 2009.  Our overall operating margin was down due to the adverse impact of AB SCIEX acquisition-related costs. Our dental platform revenues increased 10.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 2%. Cable revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, with particularly healthy demand for our imaging products, including 3D and our new intra-oral sensors.  Sales expanded in most major geographies, led by the U.S. and Europe. I'm very pleased with our year-to-date improvements in both sales and margins at cable. We expect this good top line performance to continue in the second half, largely due to new product introductions and improving end-user demand.  Sybron core sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, with strong sales of our orthodontia solutions more than offset by soft sales of general consumables due to inventory destocking in our U.S. distribution channels. However, sellout of our general consumables continues to be positive, and we expect a sequential improvement in the third quarter and a return to historical growth rates in the fourth quarter.  Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues increased 55% in the quarter, with core revenues up 7.5%. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter, driven by sales of compound and stereo microscopes in the U.S. and Europe.  We are pleased to report that our SCN400 Slide Scanner and SL801 Autoloader recently received industry awards for the Best Scan Speed and Best-Focused Images, respectively, during the European Scanner Contest held at the International Conference on Virtual Microscopy in Berlin. This recognition is particularly meaningful for Leica as they just recently entered the digital pathology scanning market.  Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a low teens rate in the quarter, with robust demand for our advanced staining systems and consumables. We saw double-digit growth across all major geographies. We continue to see excellent customer response to our BOND-III advanced staining system that was introduced in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Advanced Staining Consumables business should continue to benefit from the growing BOND-III installed base.  Radiometers core revenues grew at a low double-digit rate for the quarter, driven by solid demand for our blood gas diagnostic instruments and consumables across most major geographies, with particular strength in Asia and Europe. Demand for our ABL90 FLEX, which we launched last quarter, is quite strong. The rollout of AQT in Europe is progressing well with a key customer win at Berlin, Charité, the largest university hospital in Europe.  During the quarter, we launched the Troponin T parameter for AQT, which can be used to test several different heart disorders, including acute myocardial infarction. Product approval is still pending for all of these new products in the U.S.  We are very encouraged with the ongoing integration efforts at both AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices. One of our first major success stories at AB SCIEX has been the introduction of the new TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer. We launched this system in May at the Annual ASMS Conference, and early customer feedback has been great. The 5600 is the fastest and most sensitive high-resolution mass spectrometer for high-performance qualitative and quantitative analysis on a single platform. AB SCIEX's commitment to innovation and developing cutting-edge technology is clearly evident in the 5600. We look forward to sharing more successes like this with you in the future.  Molecular Devices has been active as well. It recently completed its first bolt-on acquisition with the PARADIGM and DTX Microplate Reader platforms from Beckman Coulter, which address both the Modular and Standard Multimode Reader segments and complement Molecular Devices' current product portfolio.  Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues increased 18.5% for the quarter, with core revenues up 15.5%. Operating margin for the second quarter was 20.4%, a 470 basis point increase compared to the same period last year due to the benefit of restructuring and cost initiatives implemented in 2009, as well as the higher sales volumes in the segment. Our core operating margin increased 330 basis points in the quarter.  Product Identification revenues were up 22.5% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 15.5% with strength in both our marketing encoding systems and the related consumables. Emerging markets led the way with 20% growth, and we also saw a sequential improvement in both the U.S. and Europe.  Motion core revenues were up 34% in the quarter, with significant year-over-year and sequential growth in all major geographies and business units, with particular strength in industrial automation, electronic assembly and elevator end markets.  During the quarter, our Thomson business captured significant new opportunities in Eastern Europe, in each case replacing local or low-cost region suppliers.  During the quarter, our Sensors and Controls business acquired IRIS Power. IRIS, headquartered in Toronto, manufactures online and offline condition monitoring products for large generators and motors, complementing our Qualitrol product offering.  And finally, moving to Tools and Components. Revenues for the quarter increased 19%, with core revenues up 20%. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year.  Mechanics' Hand Tool core revenues grew 13.5% in the second quarter, with solid sales to both the retail and professional channels across all major geographies. Sales of our domestic China tool brand, Sata, grew at a double-digit rate, and our Niche Tool business has also performed well in the quarter.  Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the strategic joint venture with Cooper Industries to combine our Tool businesses. This new company, called Apex Tool Group, offers industrial, commercial and do-it-yourself customers an unparalleled selection of over 30 leading brands. We look forward to going with Kirk [Kirk S. Hachigian] and the Cooper team to help drive the long-term value creation we both envision for our shareholders, customers and associates. Beginning here in the third quarter, we will deconsolidate the financial results of the businesses contributed to Apex and record them based on the equity method of accounting.  So to wrap up, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter. With the Danaher Business System, we believe we are well positioned here in 2010 for continued outperformance. We are initiating third quarter 2010 adjusted earnings per share guidance this morning of $0.50 to $0.55, which, at the midpoint, represents an 18% increase year-over-year.  For the full year 2010, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance from the prior range of $2.12 to $2.20 to a new range of $2.16 to $2.23. The new full year range includes approximately $0.04 of dilution resulting from the Tools joint venture, but excludes the gain that we'll recognize in the third quarter.
Matt McGrew: Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. John, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: So the 14% organic growth, Larry, could you go back and talk a little bit about how that developed? Did they accelerate through the quarter? I heard some of the comments, maybe just expand on that a bit, please.
H. Culp: I think as the quarter played out, it was solid all the way through. We saw double-digit comps year-on-year up, and that was encouraging to see. Obviously in June, we finished strong. If we did a little bit better in some places than others than we had anticipated, certainly, in Professional Instrumentation, we saw both TEK and Fluke do well. TEK clearly leading the way there, had just a very strong, very strong quarter, and I would also point out in Industrial Tech, what we saw both at Product Identification and frankly, Motion was a bit better than expected and very solid through the course of the quarter. I think that as we mentioned, we are very encouraged with what we've seen at cable, both from a top line and bottom line performance. But if you just look at top line performance in the second quarter, they were particularly strong through the quarter. I think, in the prepared remarks, we mentioned the imaging products, particularly 3D and intra-oral, I think we're seeing docs come back in the market investing in technology, investing in their practices and given the line up there that we have, both here and frankly, Europe, we couldn't be better positioned to take advantage of some of that additional investment on their part.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Yesterday, The Financial Times ran an article about Danaher potentially divesting the Aerospace & Defense business. Any comment on that? And what will be the reason for selling that, if that's correct at this point?
H. Culp: Bob, as you well know, we tend not to comment on rumors, printed or otherwise, and I think we're going to stay to that. But you're asking about our A&D businesses, those are very good businesses for us. As you know, they've been strong contributors really ever since we began to put that group together a decade ago. I think we're seeing an uptick in their performance as well, particularly at Pak side here of late. So I think they're in position to have an improved second half, and we're looking forward to that performance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: So a first question, just around the organic growth number, so that was down 15% last year and up 14% this year. I'm trying to get a sense particularly in light of your comment around dental destocking, about how much of this is sort of your estimate of restocking versus other factors, however split between share gain, et cetera. I know some other CEOs are always trying to get at this number. How do you guys look at that right now? Do you feel like there's any tailwind in this at all?
H. Culp: Well, I think if you're asking, Steve, specifically about the destocking that we have seen in dental, particularly at dental consumables, which is where the channel inventory topic I think is more relevant. I think what we've seen through the first six months, and this is not something that has happened to us, we've been working this with our channel partners, is we've been trying to be smarter about where our inventories are. We do that every time we work with distributor partners, and while we do that, we're trying to make sure we drive sell-through with them very effectively. So as I mentioned, when we look at Sybron, clearly, we would have liked to turn in a better number. I think what I focused on through the quarter was the sell-through, which was particularly good on the specialty side, particularly in ortho. The consumables sell-through was positive, but we were taking inventory down. So that hit us in the second quarter. That will moderate but continue in the third quarter. I think by the fourth quarter, Steve, you'll hear us talking about consumable Sybron at large being back to more normal growth rates, in part because the destocking will have run its course, but also in part, frankly, with how we're ramping on some of the new products. Stain and clear for example, really, is just turning onto the next phase of its ramp here in 2010. So I think we're well positioned, really, nothing there that is unexpected or of concern to me at this point.
Daniel Comas: And, Steve, we don't try to calculate how much of the 14% was share gain. Larry and I were out with most of our businesses this past quarter, and we're pretty confident that both Hach Lange and ChemTreat continue to take share. That's also true of Radiometer. I would add both Kollmorgen and Thomson to that and that may be a more recent phenomenon in the last six months. I'm very pleased with how they're doing, and based on the numbers they have in their comps, we believe we're taking some share as well. Double-digit number at cable, I think these new products are helping us. We may be back in position to taking share there as well, but we don't try to calculate how much of the 14% was share gain.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: Well, I'm more interested in how much of that 14% was restocking. I mean, do you have an idea of that?
Daniel Comas: Steve, we think it's modest. I mean, maybe it's a point or two.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And then the second point there, you mentioned municipal bookings being up in environmental. Is that stimulus-driven? Are you seeing that sort of working its way through the municipalities from federal funds, are you -- what is that? Or driving that?
H. Culp: Steve, we really don't think that we've seen any positive effect in our Water business from any federal stimulus, either here in the U.S. or frankly, throughout Asia. By the same token, we haven't really seen any negative impact from any of the austerity concerns in Europe. That business has demonstrated a level of stability and predictability that we've come to count on and thus far, no benefit and no negative impact.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: Just two more. One is you have no unusual restructuring beyond that $10 million-ish per quarter that you normally do. Many of your peer companies are continuing to press restructuring agendas very hard to drive future earnings growth, and how do you guys think about that? I mean, you're really sort of kind of delaying it. Is it because you're still kind of processing everything that's happened to date? Or from an investor standpoint, how should we think about that going forward this year?
H. Culp: Well, Steve, I think we're always in restructuring mode. Obviously, given the activity that we initiated in 2008 and pushed through hard in 2009, we got a lot accomplished. I think you'll see the benefit of that in our year-over-year and incremental margins here. But we continue to do some things, and I think as we look at the second half, there's some larger projects as well that are certainly under review. But again, in the spirit of Kaizen, we're always doing that whether we are talking about it in the way that we did last year. Obviously, we don't want to be in that position with frequency. But don't, for a moment, think that we're ever done in that regard.
Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research: And then just a quick technical question here. On the payable side and when you break out the working capital, it just look to me like payables are up and driving part of that benefit. Anything going on with suppliers there that we should be aware of?
Daniel Comas: Nothing of note. Just the higher purchases versus where we were a year ago.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Just a couple of things. First, just on -- back to dental for a moment, Larry. There's been a little bit of noise that perhaps there's a channel shift towards private label on consumables. Is that part of the equation on what's going on here at all?
H. Culp: Not in my opinion, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And then you talked about a return to historical growth in Q4. I guess there's a little bit of question on really what is the historical norm for that business. What do you view as kind of the historical kind of normalized growth rate for that business?
H. Culp: Jeff, I didn't mean to be unclear on that point. I think Sybron, in a typical period, is going to be a mid-single digit grower with obviously a lot of our efforts around new products, around international expansion aimed at lifting that number. But we're not talking about that moderation in the third and return to normal growth in the fourth. I'm really suggesting we should be back at least in the mid-single digit range by year end.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Just thinking about the forward guidance, can you give us some indication of what your view of back-half organic growth is embedded in the EPS guidance?
H. Culp: Sure. Well, I think when we look at the full year, at this point, we really think we're going to be at a high single digit level in terms of core. What that probably means, Jeff, by quarter, in the third, I suspect we're up high singles, we could hit 10% but I'd band it like that. I think as we look at the third, it will play out by and large, not unlike the second quarter. I think we'll see T&M, I think, lead the way here again. I think Motion and PID and Industrial Tech should be up low to mid-teen. Environmental should be solid as well, probably up mid-singles, and I think Med Tech, in part because of that moderation I referred to a moment ago, should be up mid-single digits. Obviously, the comps get a little tougher as we go through the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, I probably would call it mid-singles at this point. We're not seeing any of the negative headline or some of the market in our order books, in our conversations with customers just yet. But I think everybody's probably a little cautious the further out we get. But right now, call it high singles for the year with the quarters breaking out like that.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And also just on Motion, that deal you did in the quarter was probably quite small, but I can't recall a deal in the last couple of years in Motion. There's been some questions about just the kind of strategic importance of Motion overall, perhaps this Pak size speculation has caused some confusion on where you're heading with that business. But can you comment on Motion in general and kind of the strategic imperative for that business, and where that might be heading over time?
H. Culp: Jeff, just to be clear, I think the acquisition that you're referencing, the IRIS Power acquisition, is really within our Sensors and Controls group, one of our niche businesses. Probably the best business we have there is our Power Quality business, Qualitrol. And from time to time, Qualitrol has actually been a silent but savvy acquirer building out on their instrumentation position, primarily, in T&D. And IRIS gives them some online and online capability, which is quite synergistic with what they're doing, so no real change there. From time to time, we do some things with them and we get nice bumps and growth, and frankly, very nice returns. With respect to your question about Motion, as we've talked before, that's a very strong business. I think Dan and the group have done an excellent job driving margin expansion. You see that again here in the second quarter. I think we really are seeing the fruits of the teams' investments and their labors here the last couple of years, and being just more effective in driving design wins, and in turn, share gains, particularly as the market picks up here. So both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, we're very pleased with that performance and continue to, I think, have high expectations for those businesses going forward.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: AB SCIEX pro forma organic, how is that growing?
H. Culp: Well, I think as we get the new 5600 out, when we've launched that product, Jeff, we have not shipped it yet. We'll begin shipments later this year. We would expect to see SCIEX up here for the year in the mid-single digit range. So all in all, I think we're pretty much where we thought we would be at SCIEX. It's an important launch for us. We're ready to get that product out. Customer evals are underway and knock wood here, the feedback continues to be net positive.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Could you just remind us how big the collective of your Aero and Defense businesses are? And roughly, is the profitability at the corporate level are above or below?
Daniel Comas: It's about $700 million in revenues and pretty much in line with the overall company profitability.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Last quarter, Larry, you did actually talk about, I think, some of what you were seeing in Greece and some of the non-Northern European countries. Could you remind us -- or maybe, Dan, you have these numbers? Like, how big are Danaher's revenues in non-Northern Europe, and say, non-Eastern Europe? And has there been any kind of change there from the first quarter that you would call out?
Daniel Comas: John, I don't know the exact number of Southern Europe, but it's a small percentage of our European business. It's obviously a small percentage of the overall European economy, and we're particularly heavy in the north. We really haven't seen a lot across the businesses. Europe remained strong throughout the quarter. We actually had very strong June throughout Europe. We're watching it carefully, but we are not seeing much.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: In your guidance, has there been any, kind of, an update with respect to electronic supply lines? I'm thinking, perhaps, does it affect some of your medical products? You see any kind of a softening associated with that, from kind of, what you saw before? Or are you sort of been able to manage the situation? What's going on there?
Daniel Comas: We're clearly having supply chain issues across a number of our businesses, not just Med Tech. Anything with an electrical component, electronic component, whether it's PID or Gilbarco or Test & Measurement, it hasn't turned out to be a big issue within a quarter, and maybe with month-to-month, we've had some challenges. But we've been able to manage it, at least, on a quarterly basis, but we're clearly having to buy ahead a little bit more, wait in line for some products. So I don't think it's any worse in the last six months ago, but it continues to be a, probably, our biggest kind of operating challenge right now.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: But your guide, Dan, does not assume some, sort of, demand hold-back because of product constraints associated with the supply chain incrementally, does it?
Daniel Comas: No.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Dan, I think you had talked before, given how robust your results have been about some incremental spending on R&D, feet on the street. Could you just -- obviously, there's a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty. What's your latest thinking there? I mean, and how would you maybe -- are you able to even quantify some of these spending headwinds, if you want to call them that, heading into the second half but may be embedded in your guidance?
H. Culp: John, maybe I can take that. I see that opportunity, not headwind. And I think what we try to do with the updated guidance here is obviously suggest, as I referenced in my response to Jeff's question, we'll see a moderation in our core growth in large part because of the comps. We think that still gives us plenty of opportunity to increase our growth investments, increase them versus what we had budgeted, increase, frankly, versus what we had done in terms of taking those numbers up earlier in the year. I think you'll see part of that in the moderation of the incremental margins through the second half. We'll still be up, call it 35%, 40% year-on-year as that restructuring and that volume course through the P&L. But we're going to take every opportunity to continue to step up, where we see good potential, both in technology and innovation and on the go-to-market side to drive growth for '11 and '12 because we're going to be here. And I think that it's just the way we're going to manage the business.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: And do those pay [ph] equally in the third quarter and fourth quarter? Or does it ramp through to the fourth quarter?
Daniel Comas: Whole [ph] ramps. If you look at our, kind of -- maybe the best way to think about the fall through, which was about almost 50% in the first quarter, it was slightly over 40% in the second quarter. And this is stripping out acquisitions and FX. And we think it'll be in the 35% to 40% range in the back half, so maybe closer to 40% in the third quarter, and maybe closer to 35% in the fourth quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The Med Tech result was pretty weak, and I think you've gone through a little of this, but it's kind of tough for us with an ongoing facelift there, as you integrate acquisitions. Is there any way for you guys to, maybe, give us a little more granularity around what, maybe, over the next 18 months these margins can move to, so that we have a target to be able to better model this business? And maybe, what are the leverages? Is it really just the consumables on dental that get you there, or is there more heavy lifting on the cost side you need to do?
H. Culp: Steve, I think that with respect to the second quarter, I was actually very pleased with the margin performance in Med Tech. Let me just break that down, so we're all on the same page. On a core basis, if we start there, we were up 100 basis points in the second quarter, just as we were in the first quarter. And as I mentioned, I mean, cable was, I think, quite strong. They were up 300 basis points year-over-year. And as we look at the second half, again, on a core basis, we think we drive better operating margin expansion through the second half. And I just think that's the execution and the volume coming together to drive that. Now obviously on the print, what you get is the M&A impact and keep in mind, it's not the M&A impact just from SCIEX and molecular devices. We've also had two bolt-ons in that space with Genetix and Exogen, which come in. You've got the non-cash acquisition charges diluting that margin. Clearly, there's been some restructuring activity in there as well, headcount reductions and the like. And third, I'd just call out the one-time transition expenses at SCIEX. You'll recall this is a fairly complicated decoupling from two parents, so you've got IT systems that are being transitioned. You've got other one-time expenses, like leases that are being broken to stitch this business together to create the growth powerhouse that we think SCIEX can be. I think as we look out, which I think is important to your question, in the third quarter, I think you'll see us up sequentially, probably somewhere in the order of 250 basis points or more. So that should take the out margin up to the 10%, 10.5% plus range. I think you'll see incremental sequential performance improvement in the fourth quarter. On top of that, probably the same tune, we'll call it 250 bps plus, which I think puts us at a position at the end of the year where those businesses are back to a trajectory, very much in line with expectation. And I say that just back to prior conversation, all the while, I suspect we will sequentially be stepping up some of our growth investments all the while. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of clarity, but again, I think from the execution level, very strong second quarter, and I think a good outlook here in the second half for Med Tech.
C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: With regards to the acquisition pipeline, anything -- has the flavor changed at all over the last couple of months with the recent financial market volatility, whether it's regards to number of properties, size of properties, how do you characterize that for the back half of the year?
Daniel Comas: Steve, there's still a lot out there to look at. A lot of discussions going on. The volatility in recent months has probably helped on the margin. I think the concern about higher tax rates in 2011 is helping as well, so we're looking at it a lot right now.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Just wanted to follow-up on the Med Tech margins. The 2.7 points of M&A dilution, which I understand doesn't include restructuring and all the non-cash, it's a bit heavier. And it suggests that the contribution from AB SCIEX from Molecular Devices and the two bolt-ons was virtually zero. Is that correct? And how does that change at the back half of the year?
Daniel Comas: Nigel, they were positive, but not meaningfully so. As Larry pointed out, there's a lot of restructuring going on, which we're not calling out separately. There's a fair amount of, kind of, one-time transition expense, which will continue through the balance of the year at SCIEX, but we took a big chunk of that in the second quarter. So this step-up of 250-plus basis points in Q3 and another 250 in Q4 reflects both operational improvement in those businesses, as well as, kind of, much incrementally less restructuring and one-time transition expense.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Just to be clear, the 85 bps and the reconciliation, that's GAAP restructuring, whereas pay-to-go restructuring is within the 255?
Daniel Comas: That restructuring is a prior-year restructuring.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: And then turning to the guidance, I'm just looking back over the last six, seven years and 3Q EPS is always higher than 2Q EPS from a seasonal perspective. And obviously, you're guiding for it to be flat down. Can you maybe talk about that and maybe still into that conversation, the full sense of dilution from Tools, how that phases? And is that all non-cash innovation?
Daniel Comas: Maybe starting on the Tools piece, the $0.04 of dilution that we expect in the second half in our guidance, should be roughly $0.02 a quarter. It is a combination of the non-cash charges, a big piece of which is the inventory step-up, which impacts, primarily Q3. But in addition, we're pretty happy with the way the teams come together here, and we're going to let them go after some activities and cost reduction activities in the second half. And that's reflected in that dilution number as well. In terms of sequentially, if you look historically, stripping out acquisitions and FX and now stripping out DTG, revenues tend to be flat to slightly down Q2 to Q3. We're looking at that same dynamic here, so no change from previous years. Obviously, it got stronger sequentially in Q3 '09, but if you look back, '06 to '08 tends to be relatively flat. You layer in the dilution from the JV, as well as, kind of, the step up in the incremental step up in growth investment, kind of gets you to a relatively flat to slightly.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: For the industry step-up in 3Q on the JV, that's going to be within the guidance?
Daniel Comas: Yes, there are $0.04 of dilution covers. It covers everything and it's in the guidance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ajit Pai with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Ajit Pai - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The first question is just looking at the emerging markets, I think you pointed out that as a percent of revenue, what it is, could you give us some color right now, one as to, what the impact of, sort of, Chinese labor costs increasing on the East Coast of China has had in your business? And how you're thinking about future instead of capacity expansion in the area?
H. Culp: Well, I think that for several years now, we've seen labor input inflation in China as we have on other emerging markets. We obviously have our biggest manufacturing and R&D footprint in China, so that's where it's been most relevant. I think we've just been able to manage through it. We're not, I think, ignorant or otherwise discounting what's in the papers recently, but that really has not had a material effect on our cost structure. And we don't anticipate it materially changing, the same going forward. In terms of our investment level, again, I think if we execute well with the core growth and the margin fall through, we're looking to put as many feet on the street in the emerging markets in terms of sales marketing service headcount as we possibly can. And that's not only in China, but really across the globe. And in turn, make sure that we have an appropriately local R&D and manufacturing capabilities to support those efforts. For us, it's been most pronounced in China, but not exclusively. And as you saw last year, there was some inorganic investments in Brazil and India, let alone, what we did organically. Those footprints are becoming much more global than they were, say, three or four years ago.
Ajit Pai - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And the second question is just looking at carriers. I think you highlighted a video as one area of investment for your Test & Measurement business. Could you give us some color as to what you're seeing from carriers? I think you talked about some year-over-year comps being difficult there, but on the wireless and wireline side, you're actually looking at the increased investment? And how significant a driver of that overall business is video going to be?
Daniel Comas: Well I think that, if I answer it on, kind of, an all-out basis, including video as well as the other data drivers that are there, I think by and large, what we've seen is that the mobile carriers that we serve principally through TEK Comm, continue to wrestle with bandwidth constraints. Obviously, the iPhone, probably the best publicized story. The more of those that Apple sells, the more COGS some of the networks become. And that's good for us because we help clear those network problem. I think video, clearly, is a high bandwidth-consumption driver and more of this video IP that we see be in YouTube or otherwise, it's all good for us at TEK Comm. I think here in the short term, what we try to allude to in our prepared remarks, is that some of this business can be a little bit bumpy just because of installation and turn-on schedules. But these are amongst the most pressing problems our mobile carriers have right now. We're fortunate to be in there working with some of the best trying to solve them.
Ajit Pai - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But would you say that you're at an inflection point, in terms of spending in this particular category, the beginning of a multi-year cycle of increased spending over there? Or do you think you're somewhat in the middle of a spending cycle there?
H. Culp: Well, I would characterize it, and again in broader terms, as being in the middle of that cycle because video is, but one, driver of bandwidth consumption. And those drivers in aggregate have been obviously pressuring networks, and that's really created demand for our products at TEK Comm. More video can only help.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Crèdit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell: The first one was on the pricing outlook. I mean you mentioned Professional Instruments and Industrial Tech. The pricing trends look in line with what you had last year. Just if you could comment on some of the other businesses, how pricing is looking? And secondly, you talked about China a couple of times on the, sort of, the cost side of things, but in terms of demand, is there any change there in terms of what you're seeing? I mean, obviously, the overall global organic growth rate moderates in the second half, is that really just sort of a tougher comps-type issue?
Daniel Comas: Julian, on the price side, we track about a half point of price through the first half. It seems to be getting a little bit better, and we're looking for that to improve a little bit in the second half, and maybe we'll get about a point of price in the second half. Clearly, the better volume demand is giving us a little bit more latitude on price, and hopefully, we'll see some of that in the second half.
H. Culp: Julian, with respect to China, as you'll recall, we really saw China begin to recover last year in the second half, so the comps do get a bit tougher there. We were with the team Monday night. I mean, by and large, the team is very optimistic about the tone and the outlook here in the short-term. So I think what we've tried to capture in our guidance is a bit of a moderation in emerging market growth. We'll probably be somewhere in the low to mid-teens range. I think, in part, because of those comps, but China, by and large to us right now, still looks really good. Maybe the numbers won't print as big as they did, but the strength there seems to be steady, very, very steady.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just a quick question. On the Motion side of the business, we've seen a snapback in this commentary about the Symbian Electronics Assembly businesses snapping back pretty aggressively. The comps are still very easy there for the balance of the year. So maybe the question is just around the end market exposure? You had mentioned maybe the Otis, the Lift Business being better. Is there any traction on the electric vehicle side? You had some products in there, but just give us a sense of the growth rate in Motion? How sustainable that is, rather than how cyclical it appears to be?
H. Culp: Well certainly, I think the facts that you pointed out there, Rick, are spot on. I think that as we look at what we saw in the second quarter, we were obviously up at a very healthy level, in part, because of the comps. We look at the third quarter, looked at the second half. I think we're going to be up mid-teens. Again, it will be moderating as the year goes on because the comps get less easy. Some of that is a market bounce back, but as we alluded to earlier, I think this team is really executing well. That's hard to pinpoint a share point here, share point there at this point in the cycle, but I think at Kollmorgen and at Thomson, they are executing better. Our new motors and drives out at Kollmorgen, particularly, have been well received. When we go into the growth greenhouse down there with the team, the leading indicators look positive. We work to limit some of our more volatile exposure and, to say, some of the tech end markets, but that's a work in process. So I would just maybe summarize by saying, clearly, Motion's going to be a little bit more cyclical and volatile than the rest of the portfolio. We saw that last year. They're bouncing back well. I don't think that is only a function of the market. I do think they are executing quite well.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And then the second question I have, given some of the portfolio moves that you're making here of some size, we've got the $90 million of dividend on the tool side coming in. If A&D piece does get sold an eight multiple on that, that's $1 billion plus. We have some strong cash flow. We've got good capacity now, but are the items -- are the potential transactions in your M&A pipeline, have they gravitated up in size? I mean, do you see this as maybe an interesting opportunity to expand the platform and add a platform here? Just give me your thoughts on that?
Daniel Comas: Rick, I think that we are very fortunate to have the strategic and the financial degrees of freedom that we have here, in large part because of our track record and the very strong cash generation that you've seen us put up over time. I think that, obviously, we're not going to comment on some of the rumors that are out there, but suffice it to say, I think the acquisition playbook, the way we think about attractive markets, the way we think about entry points into those markets are preference for bolt-ons as opposed to new platforms, but our success with new platforms is unchanged. And as we look forward relative to how we spend that next $2 billion, next 10, next 20 deals, I would really encourage folks to look back at the last $2 billion, the last 10 or 20 transactions as the best indicator as to the type of businesses we're likely to acquire and the way in which we're likely to bring them into Danaher.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Larry, we're kind of picking up a little bit of feedback out of Europe that just, in a general sense, that reimbursement rates on the medical side for procedures, but also for equipment, that they're starting to see some pressure there on reimbursement rates more from the government entities in Northern Europe. Do you see any of that, just as general comment? Do you see any of that as a concern for the second half just given the Med Tech platform and the various ways you get paid there?
H. Culp: Rick, it really depends on where you sit, and as you know, I sit on a European Pharma board and I understand that European reimbursement dynamic quite well. Their focal point, that's a harsh reality in their business. We haven't seen it as much, you can't discount anything, I think, these days in that regard. But frankly, that sort of pressure in our businesses is, at present, not a high-priority concern for me.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Wendy Caplan with SunTrust.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Given your very disciplined M&A strategy and your comments that you prefer, want to buy 50-plus percent gross margin businesses -- another couple other M&A questions, what are you seeing in terms of the quality of potential targets relative to that margin? The multiples you're being asked to pay, we're starting to hear that some multiples are contracting a bit and the competition for those properties. And just a clarification, if you wouldn't mind, are you seeking a new platform or are you sticking to the ones you have?
H. Culp: I think with respect to just quantity and quality of activity, as Dan alluded to earlier, it's been steady and good, so I don't think we've seen a change there. I think what we saw here in the last six months is probably an uptick in the quality and in turn, the expectation's clearly, I think, one of the good things that's happened here, with the first half being as robust as it has broadly, is that certain targets are growing into some of those expectations, which has to be good. We look at a lot of things, not only in gross margin. As you say, I think our bias toward our strong branded positions often correlates well with higher gross margins. And gosh, we're just 50 bps away from printing own 50% gross margin here. And that's pretty neat given where we were 20 years ago when I joined the company. Our appetite for new platforms, I think that happens once every several years. Again, I think that's always going to be in balance for us as long as we execute well and the ones we bring in. But by and large, I think with the opportunities we have in Med Tech, both in our Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, everything happening, Instrumentation, be it Environmental, be it T&M, certainly, we'd love to see product ID bigger. We've got plenty of running room in and around those businesses to deploy capital smartly, but we would never say never relative to that next platform. It will come, it's just not something I should expect happening in the near term here. And we'd be fine with that.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And again, the multiples that you're being asked to pay for these and the degree of competition? And who are the competitors here?
H. Culp: Well, we compete with lots of different folks, but I think by and large, the competition we compete with will often be strategic, more so than financial sponsors. In the multiples, it have maybe come down a bit because businesses are growing into certain expectation. But I think by and large, it's been fairly steady through the course of 2010 so far.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And you mentioned the gross margin. I looked back and yes, it's improved steadily since, certainly, over the past dozen or more years, but you called out volumes and restructuring for this quarter, how much of the overall gross margin expansion is related to that mix of companies and through acquisition? And how high do you expect it to go?
H. Culp: Maybe offline, Matt could do a -- he can get you some numbers, Wendy. I'd be hard pressed here on the call to discern how much of our margin expansion over time would be a function of just great DBS execution, the restructuring, say from last year. Obviously, the improvements in the overall quality of the portfolio types of businesses that we have been bringing in are also a part of that equation. I don't think we have a goal. I'd love to print a few quarters here with our gross margin having a five on it, but there will be other businesses that we'll bring in. I'm sure that we'll dilute that gross margin for a period of time as we work to improve their performance and in turn, create returns for shareholders. So we're not wed to any one number on the P&L, but it seems to be closer to 50 there than 30 for sure.

Larry Culp: Thanks, good morning everyone. Let me start this morning with a brief overview what we are seeing across our businesses and end markets to provide you some context to our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to see encouraging signs that the global economy is stabilizing and in many places returning to growth. We grew 5.5% in the first quarter on a core basis, our core growth was broad based with all of our segments reporting mid-single digit growth. This represents our first quarter of core growth, hence the third quarter of 2008 clearly and positive heading in the remainder of 2010. We believe this increased demand is largely end user driven. While there has been some modest restocking going on in certain businesses, distributor destocking has run its course. We saw mid-teens growth from the emerging markets, the US grew slightly less than the overall company results and Western Europe was modestly positive. We are quite pleased with the way our business has executed during the first quarter, core operating margin expanded 285 basis points year-over-year with each of our segments achieving over 100 basis points of core improvement; our first with Danaher. Throughout the last several years, we focused on making growth investments in innovation and sales and marketing to ensure that we are well positioned to both the near and long term. As a result of that focus we’ve developed a very compelling product line-up across the portfolio that should continue to drive core growth and margin expansion. 2010 will also see a number of exciting new product launches and our timing couldn’t be better given the improving economy. We continue to capture market share through new product introductions and the impact of our DBS growth tools. Leica, DEXIS, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, ChemTreat and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken market share from competition. With that as backdrop let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.89 representing a record first quarter for Danaher and a 24% increase over last year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.96, up 33% year-over-year. Revenues for the quarter increased 17.5% to a record $3.1 billion with core revenues up 5.5%. The effect of currency translation increased revenues by 3.5% and acquisitions contributed 8.5%. Year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter increased 50 basis points to 48.4% largely due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of our 2009 restructuring initiatives. Operating margin in the first quarter increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14% resulting from higher sales volume and the benefit of our prior year's restructuring initiatives. As I mentioned a moment ago our core operating margin increased 285 basis points on a year-over-year basis. First quarter operating cash flow was record $394 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow was $355 million, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 118%. We are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash and excessive net income for what would be our 19th year in a row. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of eight companies with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $750 million including the previously announced AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices transactions. With the addition of these outstanding life science companies, our medical technology segment is now $4 billion in size. So beginning this quarter, we will break our reporting within the segment into two growth platforms. Dental and life sciences and diagnostics. We continue to believe the M&A environment is very attractive and we currently have more than 2 billion of additional M&A spending capacity to expand and strengthen our portfolio with particular focus on these growth platforms. Now turning to our operating segments, professional instrumentation revenues increased 14.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 6%. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 50 basis points to 18.2%, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the benefit of the prior year’s restructuring initiatives and notwithstanding a 75 basis point delusion from recent acquisitions. Our environmental platform revenues increased 15% in the quarter with core revenues up 8.5%. While our quality core revenues increased at a high single digit rate in the quarter. At Hach-Lange core revenues grew a high single digit rate with solid demand for both our lab and process instrumentation, consumables and services across most major geographies. Trojan continued to perform well, achieving double digit core revenue growth in the quarter due in part to the New York City drinking water project. We also experienced solid new orders from our industrial and commercial customers in North America and China specifically in the food and beverage and pharmaceutical verticals. At ChemTreat, first quarter core revenues were up low single digits driven by our sales of our cooling water applications primarily to commercial and industrial customers. We continue to capture market share over the past years, we accelerate investments in ChemTreat’s go-to-market model and we have been pleased with the early efforts to expand Chemtreat’s business into Canada and Latin-America During the quarter we acquired Western Environmental Technology Laboratories based in Oregon.
.: Based in Hamburg, Germany Fafnir’s leading technology and brand broadened GBR’s inventory management and inventory management and environmental monitoring offering for our retail and commercial customers. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Larsen & Toubro’s petroleum dispensing pumps and systems business, located in both Mumbai and Coimbatore, India. PDP is a leader in retail petroleum equipment technology for the Indian and other emerging markets. This is Danaher’s first acquisition in India and underlines our commitment to accelerating our growth in emerging markets. Moving over to test and measurements, revenues increased 17.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 4.5%. Fluke core revenues increased at a high single digit rate in the quarter, highlighted by growth in our core industrial thermography and automation products. Demand for our temperature monitoring solutions was particularly strong in the quarter as companies increased industrial production and capacity. Fluke continued to set a high bar on innovation.
 : Tektronix core revenues grew at a low single digit rate led by robust global sales of oscilloscopes with particular strength in China. We are very pleased with Tek’s broad strengthening which we believe is a result of both end user demand as well as our innovation and go-to-market market investments and that should drive double digit revenue growth beginning in the second quarter. Test and measurement world magazine named Tektronix MSO 70,000 mixed signal oscilloscopes Best In Test 2010 in the scope category beating out five other notable contenders. The MSO 70,000 launch in the fourth quarter last year it is the first mixed signal high-end oscilloscope with industry leading bandwidth. Core revenues from our Fluke networks and Tek communication’s businesses collectively declined at a low single digit rate in the quarter with mid teens growth of our core enterprise solutions at Fluke Networks more than offset by the timing of large projects at Tek Communications compared to the prior year. Orders collectively grew at a double digit rate in the quarter. Moving to Medical Technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 32.5% compared to the prior year with core revenues up 4.5%. Med tech operating margin for the first quarter was down 310 basis points from the prior year, 7.7% due primarily to the adverse impact of AB SCIEX acquisition-related costs. Our core operating margin increased 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis as a result of higher sales volumes and the benefit of restructuring initiatives implemented last year. Our dental platform revenues increased 14.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 2%. Cable revenues increased at a mid single digit rate in the quarter with particularly healthy demand for our imaging line including New DEXIS Platinum Oral sensor as well as our new E70 treatment unit. Sales in Asia grew at a mid-teens rate largely as a result of solid demand across most product categories. Sales at KaVo grew at a low double digit rate as dentists began to invest again in their practices. As a result of the restructuring initiatives, we implemented in 2009, Cable’s core operating margin increased more than 300 basis points year over year. The PaloDEx integration is progressing well. The team is quite strong with tremendous industry experience and domain expertise. DBS implementation of PaloDEx is gathering steam. We are driving growth already for their products by putting some of our distribution channels after disposal. And we are getting good early traction on lean conversion in purchasing initiatives. The Sybron core sales were essentially flat in the quarter with strong sales of our orthodontia solutions and dental and medical disinfection product lines offset by soft sales of orthodontic products in general dentistry consumables. Sales of our Damon brand of orthodontia products were at mid single digits driven by a strong response to both our new Damon Q products and the introduction of Damon Clear. Moving to life sciences and diagnostics, revenues increased 52% in the quarter with core revenues up 8%. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter driven by a substantial compound microscopic sales due in part to stimulus programs most notably in Japan. During the quarter, Leica launched the new DBM line of digital microscopes for industrial R&D and quality control applications. The DBM microscopes are designed to reach difficult to access surfaces or non-destructive inspection and feature high-quality optics enabling both 2D and advanced 3D surface measurements. In the quarter, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Genetix, a UK based provider of imaging and intelligent image analysis solutions used by scientists and clinicians to facilitate clinical diagnostics, mainstream research and the development of biotherapeutics and pharmaceuticals. We’re excited about the potential synergies between Genetix and both Leica as well as Molecular Devices. Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter with robust demand for both our core histology and advanced staining system and consumables. We continue to see excellent customer response to the BOND-III advanced staining system that was introduced in the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to a year ago, advanced staining instruments placements were up 45%. Radiometer core revenues grew at mid single-digit rate for the quarter driven by consumable sales across all major geographies with particular strength in China and the US. Our transcutaneous monitoring business grew to mid teens rate driven by exceptional performance in Latin-America. They rollout of AQT in Europe, continues the sales of approximately 50 instruments, a 150% increase from a year ago. During the quarter we have launched the ABL90 FLEX blood gas analyzer which targets mid-volume point of care testing in clinical applications and surely after the launch, the ABL90 was awarded the Medical Design Excellence Award for In Vitro Diagnostics. So along with Fluke Biomed we are very pleased to have two of our businesses recognized with this prestigious award. As we mentioned at the outset during the quarter we closed previously announced acquisitions of AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices. We are still in the very early days of integration, we have been very pleased with the customer and associate feedback we have received to date. Our initial operating reviews have been very positive and we look forward to sharing future successes with you in the coming months. Surely after closing AB SCIEX completed its first bolt-on acquisition. Eksigent Analytical based in California is a leading supplier of nano and micro liquid chromatography systems for proteomics and other analytical applications. AB SCIEX’S successful entry into this high priority adjacency, just 14 days after joining Danaher certainly set the new benchmark for our M&A and strategic efforts. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 10.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 5%. Operating margin for the first quarter was 18.9%, a 520 basis point increase compared to the same period last year due to the benefit of restructuring and cost initiatives implemented in 2009 as well as higher sales volumes in the segment. Product identification revenues were up 22% in the quarter with core revenues increasing 11% driven by both equipment and consumables demand across all major geographies. Our suite of CIJ printers continues to be well received in the market and that is by a large order from a Turkish customer for 40, 16/10 high performance printers, 1/3rd which will replace competitive offerings. Motion core revenues were 11.5% in the quarter driven by a significant pick up in semiconductor electronics assembly and industrial automation end markets, primarily in North America and China. At Kollmorgen sales of our AKM motors and drives reached record level in the quarter as these products continue to be well received in the market. During the quarter, our sensors and controls business acquired Neoptix, a manufacturer of fiber optic temperature monitoring solutions for offline and online measurements based in Canada. Finally moving to tools and components, revenues for the quarter increased 7% with core revenues up 8%. Operating margin for the quarter was 14%, an increase of 740 basis points from the prior year due to the benefit our 2009 restructuring as well as higher sales volume. In addition, the impact of higher commodity costs and a settlement of litigation matters during the first quarter of 2009 had a positive impact on year-over-year comparisons. Mechanic hand tool cores revenues grew 4% in the first quarter, led by sales to the retail channel across all major geographies due in part to a number of new product launches. Sales of our domestic China tool brands Sata grew at a double digit rate. Our niche tools businesses also performed well during the first quarter. As many of you know, in the quarter we announced our intention to form a strategic joint venture with Cooper Industries, to combine certain operations of our tools businesses in order to create a premiere global business with leading brands, greater scale and a more diversified product portfolio. We expect the combination to generate significant cost and revenue synergies over the next three to five years resulting from increased purchasing leverage, geographical and channel footprint expansion, crossbranding initiatives and other consolidation opportunities. Since the public announcement we have been quite pleased with the industry and customer reactions and continue to find additional opportunities between the businesses. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and we anticipate that it will close in the second quarter. On closing we will deconsolidate the financial results of our tools businesses and record them based on the equity method of accounting. So to ramp up were very pleased with DBS execution in the quarter which led to solid core growth supported by our continuing commitment to organic growth investments and our very good cash flow performance. With DBS driving our focus we believe we are well positioned in 2010 will continue our performance. This morning we are initiating second quarter 2010 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.05, which is mid-point representing 29% increase year-over-year. For the full year 2010, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance from the prior range of $3.86 to $4.16 to a new range of $4.25 to $4.40.
Matt McGrew: Thanks Larry that concludes our formal comments, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will first hear from Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: These industrial tech margins are just are great and your operating leverage there was fantastic, can you speak to the sustainability? I understand the restructuring there, some are permanent. But where there any mix issues in the quarter or anything that would impact this margins going forward?
Larry Culp: Well I think, the underlying performance that you see there Scott is strong, obviously part of what works here is the comparisons, both in industrial and tools. They are easy here in the first quarter. They get tougher as the year plays out, but I think the underlying performance that you see coming from the restructuring, the cost out for most programs, the read through and turn from the incremental volume is what it is. So we are very pleased with that execution, but again we would anticipate that fall through that you see in industrial and tools and tools are like nearly a 100%, that will certainly fade as the year goes forward.
Dan Comas: If you look at industrial pack about 19%, I don’t think we are going to get higher than that during the year in part because of some of the investments that we are accelerating but you know something in the high teens is something we believe we can sustain in that segment.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Your typical 1Q is about 20% of your full year which would imply a bit higher than what you are guiding, is there again any timing issues and I guess the real heart of my question is I know a quarter ago we asked about price and there was still some uncertainty, year-over-year your price was going to be more flattish and obviously commodity costs have gone up, does that cost some conservatives for the rest of the year or is there something out there?
Larry Culp: No, I think as we look forward, Scott, we were felling very good about the near-term outlook here in the second quarter. I think the second quarter core growth likely to be high single, could be double-digit based on the order book that we saw in the first quarter the way, we started out here certainly T&M has been [white] hot starting that in regard. I think as we look forward through the rest of the year, particularly as we think about the second half, the comps do get tougher, you know that. China has been very strong, Dan and I were over last week, the government’s obviously trying to temper some of that growth, that’s something we need to keep in mind as we think about the rest of the year. For being a tad conservative, so be it. But I think as we look out through the second half, I would expect all things being equal right now, for our core growth to be if you will in line with what we’ve seen here in the first quarter, I think we’ll get good follow through, but again because the comps get a little tougher, we end up with the range today that we’ve highlighted.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: First question, just related a little bit more on the margin side. The implied incrementals across the whole business I’ve got on the core business close to 70%, it looks like a bunch of that from industrial as Scott mentioned, but as you look forward in terms of the progression of those margins throughout the business and given the organic growth as it continues to increase, how do you see cost coming back in the rest of the business and impacting those kind of seller incrementals outside of industrial tech?
Larry Culp: The way I think about the cost side Steve is again we think we will have positive price this year. It’s got alluded to, it will be less than it has been in the last couple of years, but I think the cost that comes back that’s frankly most material are the growth investments that we are going to make. We have said that all along as the economy permits. We certainly got off to a much better start than we anticipated here in the first quarter. We were able to put some additional moneys to work particularly in med tech and professional instrumentation and just this week we have left with additional funding again both around sales and marketing investments that are going to help us this year and the R&D and innovation programs that will help us in the out years. So that’s probably the most material incremental spend as we think about the rest of the years and how that may impact the margins in the business.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay and then secondly, on core growth, clearly this has been an area where I and others have been more critical and looking for evidence of improvement, 5.5 is a big number and you talked a lot about product launches. When you look across the portfolio in terms of vitality index and the many product launches from last year, a way to think about that 5.5 % in terms of how much is coming from new product development and what sort of changing on that front in aggregate?
Larry Culp: Well I think it’s hard, I mean we certainly look at vitality given where we are in the cycle right now. We’re going to be up in the 30-plus percent range in that regard continuing to I think show progress. I say it’s a leading misleading to focus on that exclusively given that many of those new products go to market hand-in-hand with not only the increased investment but also the increased intensity around our go-to-market DBS tools all of which are helping us right now, not only in the emerging markets where we saw exceptional double digit growth, but in the western markets where we were up more so in the US and in Europe but where we think we are taking market good share. I think I'm very pleased Steve with the way we’re able to free money up from the re-structuring and obviously, a better topline environment right now to put more money to work in the areas where I think we are executing better than we have in sometime.
Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: And what do you see is the biggest risk to that core growth as you look forward to the rest of the year?
Larry Culp: I think we are benefiting from a rising tide right now. We’re taking full advantage of the market opportunities. So I would say, in term of risks, it’s probably the biggest risk, is probably the one outside of our control and that’s the macro question. I mentioned China earlier. I tend not to bet against the Chinese government to the extent that they are looking to tamper our growth there. Again, we were thrilled with that we saw. It’s an incredible start to 2010 based on our reviews last week but to the extent that, that slows a bit it will still be great growth. It will be a little less than what we’re seeing right now.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Bob Cornell of Barclays Capital.
Bob Cornell - Barclays Capital: How about some comment about the acceleration through the quarter? Other companies have talked about a strong margin, I mean when you gave the arrear guidance you said a mid-March and obviously quarter came in better than pre-announced. How about a little color there?
Larry Culp: We’re an outlier in that regard Bob. We saw a very good progress through the quarter again, really without exceptions both in terms of the major businesses and geographies. I think you see that, you’ve seen that obviously as you look at how we’ve adjusted guidance several times over the last three or four months. I said that just to underscore the piece that isn’t in the printed core numbers here is the big backlog build that we had in T&M. The book-to-bill there was nearly 110%, both Fluke and Tech are performing very well right now. We’re pleased with that and again, talking about [C&M] in the double digit range here in the second quarter going forward, we’re thrilled to see that sort of bounce back particularly given the road traveled in the last five or six quarters.
Bob Cornell - Barclays Capital: Again, going back to this preview of the quarter you talked a lot about a focus on the growth and investment in organic growth and talked about the new product launches here in 2010, the market share gains. I want to take a minute and just sort of highlight some of the things that you noticed, maybe where you sort of gained market share that was incremental what you have previously expressed?
Larry Culp: Well, it’s hard to pinpoint share gains in the last 30 days, but we know we have been doing very well particularly with the new products in med tech and professional instrumentation. Why it got probably the highest vitality in the organization, the new digital microscope, the slide scanner that we talked about with folks in New York. Those products are going on very well, the Bond-III or the pathology customer and like the bio-systems had an exceptional first quarter. It’s a long list Bob, but I think again, what we’ve tried to do very systematically across the businesses and is make sure that we are putting in the funds to support this sort of investment level. We are up to what over 6% R&D as a percent of sales. It is higher you know lot of these med tech and instrumentation businesses. And those production is going to market both in the West and developed markets as well as an emerging markets with a full complimented DBS growth tools driving the sales in the marketing.
Bob Cornell - Barclays Capital: It pretends to me like Motion had a better quarter than maybe you indicated when you went through their preview talking about Kollmorgen and motors at record levels. Would you just flush out the Motion outlook and maybe what they did in the quarter in terms of profitability.
Larry Culp: Sure, well if you look at industrial which is obviously a combination of both motion and product ID. I think we saw in motion a very strong end user demand particularly in tech end markets and in some of the industrial automation markets and that just built through the quarter. For motion that was again a high single digit growth in the first quarter. They are going to be clearly one of our better growers as we look here in the second quarter because of the backlog bills and the capital investment progress that we see particularly in some of those end markets. So we’re pleased with that and had a big hand in that strong margin expansion in the industrial segment where we saw fall through nearly at 60%. Again, that will fade a bit as we move forward and we take advantages to some of the growth and investment opportunities in motion, but all in all, their execution it was really quite strong in the start of the year.
Dan Comas: They had about mid teen margins, Bob and that was really encouraging because that’s where they got to right before the downturn, so to come out and get right back there was very encouraging. As Larry mentioned we will be accelerating some investments there but we think we can sort of sustain in the mid teens for the balance of the year.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Maybe step back and given the kind of a little bit of the bigger picture discussion of M&A and the follow-on deal in AB SCIEX, 14 days after the deal closed, obviously kind of highlights the Danaher strategy of when you do a deal you know what the next two or three or four are going to be and you know, it does look like we’re moving into an environment where assets are starting to break free. We saw the Millipore go, obviously, that probably had to be on your Board, maybe it all happened too fast before you could react to it. But I guess the heart of my question is, as you mentioned you have $2 billion of capacity, but in actuality, you probably have more than that if you think about the EBITDA of the acquired company and your willingness to use equity from time to time so I am just wondering if you could comment on your appetite to actually do something of that size, you know the $5 billion to $6 billion to $7 billion deal and what you might be willing to do with the balance sheet or stock issuance if you sold the right property in that size range?
Larry Culp: Jeff, I think the M&A environment in our view has been good. I think things have been available for sometime obviously with the 18 deals we closed or announced last year. We are spending like $200 million already here in the first quarter on another handful of new situations. I think our M&A approach through the cycle has been pretty consistent to the bulk of what we are going to do, we are going to be the bolt-ons that strengthen our competitive positions around existing businesses. I think in a normal year, when we do a dozen deals, they are going represent half to three quarters of the deal flow. They are going to be the mid-sized transactions. Handful of those be it molecular devices, a couple of hundred million of revenue and then every year there is going to be in all likelihood a larger transaction be it AB SCIEX, be it Tektronix, be it a Sybron. I think every once in a while you could expect us to do something bigger but again I think that will be the exception as opposed to the number one priority. As you point out, if required if the opportunity presented itself, could spend more than 2 billion in a single shot. But I think if you look at our track record, while we look at a lot of things, our body work is the best indicator of the deal flow and we’re likely to present to you going forward.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Certainly there would not be any strategic objection, no to stepping up that something that’s been in the Danaher wish list for a long period of time, kind of broke free and look like it was available.
Larry Culp: Yes, if something was strategically compelling, if we knew we at least had a view with conviction, if we could add value and the math work, we would take a very serious look at it. But again, I think that the way we think about our capital deployment, let alone strategy has played itself out in a very consistent way over time, I think that’s the best indicator as to what the next year or two or three is likely to look like.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: You said you saw a backlog of capital projects in automation in motion, are there any particular vertical markets that stand out there. Is it a thing to pick up an activity?
Larry Culp: I would say the pick in motion Jeff has been most pronounced in the tech end markets, particularly semi.
Operator: Next question from John Inch of Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: We do expect tools to be doing deals soon after the deal with Cooper closes? How should we think about that and the opportunity there?
Larry Culp: I think that there is a potential in the new structure for the venture with its own balance sheet to look at things that the business is on, we thought apparent might not have done previously, but I think if we get this venture consummated, I think the organic growth potential, the cost out synergies are going to be the higher operating priorities for that team.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Is that because there aren’t a lot of deals or just because there is just a lot of internal stuff that should be done first?
Larry Culp: It’s an operating priority in many respects to the task ahead for the team is not unlike that of an acquisition, right? We have got two business coming together obviously under a different type of governance structure, but the work of putting these businesses together getting the cross branding, the cross selling underway, getting the consolidated purchasing activity underway, that clearly has to be the first order business and we have obviously talked about putting these businesses together with Cooper, this conversation that goes back nearly 10 years. I think we are really thrilled to be partnering with these guys, these are guys we know and trust. The primary motivation here is the organic agenda, both top-line and bottom-line and that’s clearly where the team need to be focused in the near term but I think there are opportunities that we could avail ourselves going forward, but that if you will John as a second step.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Dan, is there are way to frame out or quantify some of this growth spending that you had talked about and I am presuming that does has much to do with capacity, that has to do with R&D?
Larry Culp: This is R&D and then feed on the street. If you look at the cost fall through in the first quarter and you know we have obviously have the benefit, been able to strip it all that kind of acquisition. We are probably about 50% fall through and would expect that, that would sort of modulate down. We talked in December about 30, 35, my guess is the balance yield will be 35 to 40. Part of that, a piece of that is the margins comps get a little tougher, but the bigger piece of that is acceleration in investment.
Dan Comas: And I am assuming this is also proportionately to the back half right versus the second quarter like I assume that this is going to take a little bit of time to implement.
Larry Culp: We have started to let some things go even in the middle of the first quarter. So we’ll see a full pretty full ramp of some of that in Q2, but that will be probably more, even more in the second half.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: And then how are you guys managing these supply change issues that you’ve talked about before, obviously the rescuers to the upside, but as you’ve seen in other circumstances, not so much with Danaher, but just scenarios where the supply chain can’t manage the upside, you know the cost averages and that sort of thing. I mean maybe a little bit of an update in terms of your activities there and why that’s not a risk?
Larry Culp: Well I suspect, John as we’ve discussed I mean that is one of the key operating challenges on the platform in the supply chain as this rising tide courses through the business of ours and others. I think we are seeing isolated situations particularly in electronic components, where lead times are being extended which just creates a bit of a scramble. So I think being very close to certain suppliers making sure that we have our place in line if you will. It’s just a lot of hand to hand daily work which is the way we are managing through that. In a number of cases we’ve get monthly or quarterly sessions with vendors to make sure that since the operating company or Danaher at large is having its needs met obviously we need to make sure we’re calibrating the forecast with them vis-à-vis capacity in the like, but I think it’s really just a lot of daily work to make sure we have what we need to keep pace with this increase in demand.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: It’s not you are signing new suppliers and it sounds like you’re just working more closely with the existing chain?
Larry Culp: I think, by and large, but again we buy tens of thousands of components. In some cases and situations we will have to add or switch vendors. So I think by and large our preference and our practice is to work with the existing vendors, they’ve obviously been through rather rigorous qualifications with respect to quality and capacity, obviously price as well.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: I think the tax rate guide in the Q said you are now expecting it at a 26.5, is that because of strength in higher tax jurisdictions or is there something else going on?
Larry Culp: It’s primarily because the Congress, the R&E tax credits has not been put back in and a lot of people think it will be sometime this year which would probably bring the rate back down a little bit, but that’s the biggest driver.
Operator: As a reminder, we ask you to please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. We’ll now hear from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Any strong sense on you know, the extent to which you’re benefiting from, you mentioned stimulus and like of them, stimulus is not a big deal, but certainly inventory restocking could be, do you have any sense on that?
Larry Culp: I think we are getting a little bit of stimulus benefit. interestingly it is I think primarily out of Asia, China and Japan as opposed to the US right now and you are right it’s principally in med tech and Leica. The restocking I don’t think is driving a lot of this upside, I am sure there is some of it in particular distributors and in certain OEM situations, but by and large as we look at sell through and where we see demand on a direct basis, this is reporting very health conditions. So really again attribute, the vast majority of what we are seeing right now and certainly the basis score, the high double digit outlook for the second quarter to end user demand.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: I think now you mentioned the book-to-bill in test and measurements to 1.1. I know you don’t generally give those metrics, but you have in the last couple of quarters I mean how does that look for the entire portfolio?
Larry Culp: For Danaher at large, it’s slightly less and I think you are going to appreciate, that’s not a number I think we try to get out there with regularity, but I think it’s important to understand what’s happening in T&M right now. We had significant backlog build, again very strong order books and we talk about double digit growth there starting in the second quarter, is largely on the back of this very robust order book of late, again broadly based in TNM. We are going to make sure people understand the first quarter and the outlook in that context.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: R&D, you’ve mentioned a couple of times about, put something to work there, where do you think that goes this year. I mean the 6.1% for the first quarter, AB SCIEX coming there where I am assuming the R&D intensity is a little bit higher. What is a good number for the full year?
Larry Culp: No, I don’t have a number handy, but even with a pretty high organic growth, we kept R&D constant with a percentage of sales versus last year, but we’re ramping that up and we would expect that to continue to ramp that up, but we’re probably north of 6% for the year. That’s with obviously good core revenue growth.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: FX for the full year?
Larry Culp: Well, given the news this morning, when you get double digit returns on Greek bonds with the Euro down, I think it’s 132, 133 this morning. FX is probably neutral to revenues in Q2 and probably negative two to 4% in the second half, but clearly some headwinds there, also we had enough other good things going on.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: How much was your China specifically, your China business up in the quarter?
Dan Comas: It was up north of 25%.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. What would you expect I guess just geographic core growth dynamics to the rest of year I would assume that slows and the US and Europe pick up a bit. I mean can you talk about those dynamics?
Larry Culp: I think if you look at the first quarter, we saw that obviously the emerging market led by China was up double digit. North America was up threeish percent. Europe was positive but very modestly so. As we look forward, I think the emerging markets are good here in the second quarter. We might see a bit of a tail given China, but that is definitely going to lead the way. I think US could stay in this range get a little bit better I think Europe’s a bit of wild card frankly, and we would like to hope Europe does better than slightly positive but as Dan just alluded in that last answer, number of dynamics going on over there right now. I think Steve I think we feel good about the macro backdrop in the second quarter and don’t have major concerns about the second half.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right and then just an unrelated question what should we thinking about as the bar, is there a revenue number, is there a size of deal that you know where we would be stripping out and adjusting earnings. Is it a new platform you know because the EPS we are shipping out this quarter I guess it’s kind of a new platform but in med tech it’s not you know a $1 billion deal or from a revenue perspective, maybe you could just give us some sort of a bar so that we can you know when you guys announce these deals we can figure out if it’s going to be adjusted or not out of the EPS number.
Larry Culp: I mean the best way to be to look at some examples you know the only thing we are calling out this year is [indiscernible] transactions which are combined at the loss of a $1 billion. The other deals that we’ve done you know PaloDEx that were $200 million and some of the other deals in that size range you know we’ve not called out, no. So that would be as good a frame as that is we would have right now Steve.
Dan Comas: And we will give out the deals, Steve. I mean rest assured we will tell you what our intent in that regard is.
Operator: Next we hear from Ajit Pai of Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Just going back to the commentary that you provided in terms of business conditions by geography, ignoring the headlines just looking at Western Europe you said that it sort of was you know modestly positive the growth over there. The trend, in Europe right now is either improving trend, is it deteriorating or is it just sort of you know chugging along.
Larry Culp: I say it’s kind of straddling steady and improving.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay and then looking at China you talked about the 25% growth in China and then for all of 2009 it was about 6.2% of revenue. You probably seen the fastest growth if your business is larger for the geographies out of China. Do you expect China over next you know 18 months to break into double digits of the percentage of your revenue?
Larry Culp: I think even if they maintain that cliff, I think they don’t get that high that quickly. Given the growth for seeing everywhere else, but we have to take out some of the math.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay and then to the same point when you are looking at the emerging markets and you talked about your first sort of real acquisition in India. So the Indian market how are you looking at it, are you looking at it like what are you know the manner in which you looked at your investment in China about 10 years ago. You planned to be much more active in that market over the next 3 to 5 years. Are you saying things will be progressing more slowly there in terms of building up your presence there?
Larry Culp: Well despite the greater than 25% growth in China that we saw in the first quarter, they didn’t win the growth challenge in the quarter. The Indian team did. They did better albeit of a smaller base. We were on the phone in fact just yesterday with that team. I think the play work we are trying to run there is, is very similar, largely organic opportunity. But one we are frankly across all of our growth platforms particularly in med tech environmental, certainly in TNM and product ID as well, just a wealth of opportunity and we are trying to make sure that we are investing as aggressively and as smartly as we can there. We’d like to find the inorganic opportunities like the L&T situations, there are some, but anything much like we built this billion plus, billion dollars business in China, it will wisely be on the back of the organic play. Interestingly, SCIEX comes in, given their strong position with the pharmaceutical companies and other life science researches in India. They represent our -- one of our bigger footprints in India straightaway. That’s going to be helpful, not only as we help them accelerate their own growth as we will the rest of SCIEX. But I think that will have still a benefit for the rest of the group particularly as we think about Leica, Molecular Devices and some of the other lines there.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Just two quick questions. I wanted to circle back for a second or so to the fall through in margin and basically in med tech and professional instrumentations, instrumentation, when I kind of work them out here and I pull out the inventory charges, both look surprisingly low again, relative to the core growth in those businesses namely PI. Again, it sounds like from your commentary that’s where the biggest growth investments took place? But if you look at the fall through without those incremental growth investments, are we looking at something that’s closer to 35% or 40% fall through at the EBIT line in those?
Dan Comas: I mean both of those segments had north of a 100 basis points of core margin improvement and both of their fall through, when you strip out the acquisition, but including the growth investments, they were both in the 35 to 40% range.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: With the growth investments?
Larry Culp: Yes.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Larry, on the industrial tech side of the business. I am going to just assume the book-to-bill, was it as strong as it was on the PI side or electronic test side. Can we see revenue continue to retch it up from the first quarter base in industrial tech?
Larry Culp: If you look at industrial, we would certainly look to see both motion and [PID] in the high single digit range for the year. So I think they are off to a good start in building backlog.
Dan Comas: Most notably motion, we have given the order book the backlog despite the roughly 10% organic growth, that I wish you get better here in the next in Q2.
Larry Culp: Yes certainly easy comps and some momentum too.
Operator: Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: Just wanted to follow up on some of the color on the cadence on the organic. The 8 to 10% upper single digit, low double digits organic for 2Q, that’s essentially the pace you had in March and so you are expecting that to continue and then also to continue in the second half of the year roughly at that level. Is that the right color there?
Larry Culp: No, I think we are going to high single possible, double digit in the second quarter. I think that at this point we characterize the second half is likely to be in line with what we have seen here in the first quarter which is the 5.5%. Obviously if we continue to see the conditions that we have seen here recently even with the tougher comp in the second half, it could play out more favorably, but right now. I think that’s what we’re going to go with.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: You had talked about the potential for a snap back on a couple of quarter basis because of the under investment last year. And so that’s the cadence you’ve laid out there is sort of more consistent with that idea. And as you said, who knows where the second half goes from an upside perspective with CapEx and then it kicks in more. But I'm wondering if I could follow up on the expectations within that second quarter core growth, color around med tech kind of breaking out life sciences and diagnostics versus dental. And any color on the kind of orders to support that outlook be helpful?
Larry Culp: Sure. I think at med tech as we look at the core and obviously excludes the new businesses which by the way you are doing nicely, the integration is proceeding very well. I think med tech is likely to be up mid singles in the second quarter. I suspect we’ll see life sciences and diagnostics do better than dental. The consumables business has been a little sluggish here domestically, but the equipment business globally, has started, has bounced back a little bit better than we would have anticipated. But nonetheless, when you compare the two, I think Leica and radiometer are going to outpace cable and Sybron, but all will be positive. And with the product launches we’ve got in Sybron forthcoming, we could do a little bit better perhaps than we have done here right now.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then, just following on your comments on integration of AB SCIEX, I think that we had all looked back at some of the margins that that business did couple a years ago. They got into the low 20s at the EBIT level I think back in ‘06 or ‘07 and said, hey, why can't we get back there with the implementation of DBS in some time by 2011 or so. I think you guys are a little more cautious than that, thinking upper teens, mid to upper teens. Can you calibrate us on that?
Larry Culp: Sure, I think some of those data points Terry maybe molecular devices as opposed to SCIEX, but nonetheless I think just the update on the transactions is again the integration is going very well. I think we are very pleased with the way the team has embraced the new structure and certainly DBS, I want to underscore that SCIEX and molecular devices are two different businesses. And part of that kind of needed molecular devices so far is that we have kind of gotten them back to their independent status, reminiscent of what we did back in ‘02 is with Videojet and Gilbarco, the molecular science back on the door, we put in a dedicated full time President that is quickly becoming a very focused team and they are jazzed about their opportunities as we are. Obviously at SCIEX we are excited about the new product pipeline, we will have some news in the next month at the ASMS show. Eksigent, the bolt-on obviously very important force on the LT side. And keep in mind that there is another transaction the mix here that’s the Genetics deal that they would like a bid. Number of cross connections probably more than we even realized early on between Leica, Mole Dev and Genetics which we think will be interesting both on the academic and on the drug discovery side in time. In terms of margin expectations these are a 50% plus gross margin businesses Terry. So, I think as we do our normal drill 15% to 20% operating margins that’s the zone they are going to be in and obviously as you get towards the higher end of that we are going to look to make sure we are making the right decisions between margin expansion and growth investments. With those sorts of gross margins as you’ve seen it do elsewhere, the operating margins should be very healthy and the cash gen should be strong.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: And 2010?
Larry Culp: That’s where we are heading. Next year’s is a push, but we will be making a lot of progress here, this year, next year going forward in that very direction.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs: So in 2010 you are closer to low end of 15 to 20 range.
Dan Comas: They are below that, when we announced that not much has changed, SCIEX was double digit, Mole Dev was actually loosing money as already seem to have turned, so we are starting to build sort of bases, but ramping up.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions, Mr. McGrew I’d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing comments.
Matt McGrew: Thanks April. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and Daniel and I are going to be around all day for any follow up calls for those who want it.
Operator: That does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you all for your participation.

H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Good morning everyone. I’ll start this morning by providing an overview of what we’re seeing across our business and in markets to frame-up the backdrop for our quarterly results and our outlook for the first quarter. We are quite pleased with the way our business has executed and what was clearly a very challenging operating environment throughout 2009. Despite those pressures, we were able to successfully protect and nurture our organic investments while staying quite active on the acquisition front announcing or closing 18 transactions throughout the year. Many of our end markets have stabilized and our order book continues to improve. In the quarter, orders were down low single digits compared to 9% organic decline in shipments which includes the impact of four fewer selling days. Clearly a positive going into 2010. We believe by and large that the de-stocking that has occurred principally in our distribution channels in the US and in Europe has run its course. We continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share, ChemTreat, DEXIS, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Videojet, and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share in 2009 driven by our increased focus on EBS sales and marketing tools as well as our investments in innovation. After returning to modest growth in the third quarter, China domestically grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter with our Hach Lange and Leica businesses leading the way. We also saw a return to growth in Latin America, India, and other emerging economies. The US was in line with overall company results while Western Europe was relatively weaker. During the quarter, we again saw the benefits of the restructuring payoff as our core operating margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year. We were particularly pleased that our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up slightly over the prior year despite the 9% organic revenue decline. Our 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities are now substantially complete. Over the last five quarters, we spent approximately $320 million, eliminated 5100 positions, and closed 43 facilities. We expect $170 million of incremental benefit from these actions in 2010. So, with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.80, up 13% from last year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $1.12. For the full year, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $3.46, a 12.5% decline compared to 2008. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.53. Revenues for the quarter decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $3.1 billion with core revenues down 9%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 4.5% and acquisitions contributed 3% to sales growth. Our full year 2009 revenues were down 12% year-over-year to $11.2 billion with core revenues also declining 12%. Year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points to 45.9% largely relating to our 2008 and 2009 restructuring initiatives as well as lower commodity costs which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs in the quarter. Operating margin in the fourth quarter decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 12.6% with the impact of incremental restructuring costs more than offsetting the benefit provided by this restructuring and other cost reduction activities. Our core operating margin increased 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis despite the core revenue decline. For the full year, our operating margin was 13.8% compared to 14.7% in 2008. 2009 operating cash flow was $1.8 billion, a 3% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion and our free cash low to net income conversion ratio was 140% representing the 18th year in a row where we delivered free cash flow in excess of net income. The Danaher business system continues to be the primary driver of our cash flow performance. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 6 companies with aggregate and annual revenues of about $250 million to strengthen our environment, test, and measurement and dental businesses and to continue the evolution of our portfolio. For the full year, we closed or signed 18 transactions totaling approximately $1.1 billion in revenue and which will deploy capital of $1.9 billion. Heading into 2010, we believe we have more than $2 billion of additional M&A spending capacity to expand and strengthen the portfolio. As part of our portfolio evolution, we also completed three small divestitures during the fourth quarter. Now, turning to our operating results, professional instrumentation revenues decreased 1.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 10%. For 2009, revenues decreased 11% with core revenues down 12.5%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 80 basis points to 18.6% primarily due to the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities. Our environmental platform revenues increased 5.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 3%. For 2009, revenues were flat year-over-year with core revenues down 1.5%. Water quality core revenues decreased at a low single digit rate in the quarter. At Hach Lange core revenues declined at the same low single digit rate with strong growth in our service business more than offset by lower instrument sales. Our China business was up, more than 20% in the quarter resulting from increased enforcement of environmental regulations. Overall, we are beginning to see an increase in project activities which is a strategic focus of ours as we look to expand our install base and capture the recurring revenue stream from consumable sales. Restructuring actions taken throughout 2009 helped to expand fourth quarter operating margins more than 100 basis points over the prior year.  Trojan’s core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter with strong growth in drinking water applications primarily related to New York City drinking water project. Sales to industrial and commercial markets rebounded in the quarter after experiencing declines throughout most of the year. For the full year, Trojan core revenues grew at a mid teens rate, and they ended the year with a robust backlog. At ChemTreat, fourth quarter revenues were up mid single digits year-over-year driven by sales of our boiler cooler water applications primarily to commercial and industrial markets. We believe that we continue to capture share across many of our end markets and are pleased with recent wins in the chemical and petroleum verticals resulting from our DBS initiatives. During the quarter, we acquired CRISON Instruments, a manufacturer of electro-chemistry instruments and consumables headquartered in Barcelona. CRISON’s high quality, easy to use product, portfolio strength has been top-lined as E-chem lab and process business. Also in the quarter, ChemTreat acquired Trident Technologies, a provider of water treatment services to commercial, institutional, and industrial customers in the Western US and Mexico. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s fourth quarter core revenues declined in the mid single digit rate year-over-year. At Gilbarco, sales increased in a low single digit rate. Continued growth in our passport point of sales systems and payment solutions more than offset lower dispenser sales. Veeder-Root sales were down in the quarter partially due to a difficult year-over-year comparison around waiver recovery in California. Moving to test and measurement, revenues declined 10% in the quarter with core revenue down 18%. For the full year, core revenues were down 24%. Fluke core revenues declined at a low teens rate in the quarter with growth across the emerging markets and China more than offset by declines in other geographies. Importantly, bookings followed the outpaced shipments in the quarter, driven in part by the recent launch of several new products including the 233 digital remote display multi-meter and our Ti32 thermal imager. Also during the quarter, Fluke announced a $1.4 million award from the National Institute to the standards and technology to develop a new instrument to calibrate and measure the magnitude and phase of voltage and current for smart grid applications. This grant is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment to support research and to advance measurement science in areas of critical national importance. This award recognizes Fluke’s outstanding brand quality and is a testament to its robust R&D capabilities. At Tektronix we saw a strong sequential order growth in the quarter resulting from new product introductions and an improving R&D spending environment. In China, orders were up double digit year-over-year. Shipments, however, remain weak across all major product categories and geographies. We do though remain optimistic that the broad-based improvement in order activity is indicative of a strengthening in our end markets. Core revenues from our Fluke networks and Tek Communications businesses collectively declined at a low single digit rate in the quarter with high teens growth of network management solutions at Tek Communications more than offset by weak demand across most product categories. During the quarter, Tek Communications launched the G10, it’s next generation monitoring platform used to collect, correlate, and analyze signaling data for next generation IT telecom networks. Early feedback from customers has been quite positive. Also during the quarter, we acquired Sypris Test and Measurement and Davis Tech. These businesses are leading providers of calibration services, testing, and component screening products serving military, aerospace, avionics, and telecommunications customers. These two acquisitions, Sypris and Davis accelerate a key strategic initiative at Tektronix to expand its service offerings.  In the quarter, we acquired ClearSight a California based provider of network analysis tools for real-time application monitoring, protocol analysis, and troubleshooting. ClearSight came to us from Toyo, a longtime partner of ours in Japan. The business enhances Fluke Network’s protocol analysis product line and strengthens its access to the Japanese network monitoring market. Moving to medical technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 9% compared to the prior year period with core revenues down 2%. For 2009, revenues decreased 4% with core revenues down 5%. Med tech operating margin for the fourth quarter was down 220 basis points from the prior year to 8.5% due primarily to the impact of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs and transaction cost associated with pending and completed acquisitions. However, our core operating margin increased 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis as the result of the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2008 and 2009. Within our dental business, core revenues declined at the mid single digit rate in the quarter. Sybron core sales declined at a low single digit rate with strong sales of our orthodontia solutions and disinfection product lines more than offset by soft sales of general dentistry consumables. Sales of our Damon branded orthodontic system were up more than 20% in the quarter driven by an excellent response to our new Damon Q product and the introduction of Damon Clear. During the quarter, we expended the distribution channels for Sybron which thus far has been very positively received by the market. Cable revenues declined at a mid single digit rate in the quarter with improved performance on the sequential basis across most geographies and product categories. A number of recent product launches including the DEXIS Platinum sensor, the KaVo comfort drive hand-piece, the Gendex 8500 2D panoramic imager and the KaVo E70 treatment unit contributed to this improved performance. Additionally, we believe channel inventory reductions are largely complete, recent restructuring initiatives benefited KaVo’s bottomline with fourth quarter operating margins increasing more than 200 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we also closed the previously announced acquisition of PaloDEx, a Finland based manufacturer of dental imaging products which is expected to strengthen our digital imaging product portfolio in all key categories. Leica core revenues were essentially flat in the quarter with strength across Asia and Latin America offset by weaker demand in the US and Europe. I’m pleased to report though that for a second year in a row, Leica exceeded $1 billion of sales. Leica Microsystems continues its success in Japan where we have awarded orders totally more than $15 million including the large forensic order we referenced last quarter as part of that country’s stimulus program. In the US stimulus funding has begun to flow although microscopy awards to date have been modest. Subsequent to quarter’s end, we acquired Genetix, a UK based provider of imaging and intelligent image analysis solutions used by scientists and clinicians to facilitate the development of pharmaceuticals biotherapeutics, mainstream research and clinical diagnostics. The acquisition of Genetix strengthens Leica’s position in the high growth virtual microscopy market and expands our research and clinical businesses. Leica Biosystems core revenues increased at a mid single digit rate in the quarter. In October, we launched the BOND-III advanced staining system which combined with our BOND Max product contributed to a significant increase in instrument placements during the quarter. We have been very pleased with early customer demand for the BOND-III and we recently won a multi-unit order from one of most influential diagnostics labs in the UK. Overall, our advanced staining and instruments consumables business grew more than 30% in the quarter. Radiometer’s core revenue grew at low single digit rate for the quarter driven by continued strong consumable sales primarily in Europe and Asia. In 2009, we sold approximately 200 AQT instruments which is nearly five times the numbers sold in 2008 and the customer feedback has been very encouraging. AQT's launch in the US and Japan is still pending and we wait regulatory approvals. Moving to our industrial technology segments, revenues declined 9.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 15%. For 2009, revenues decreased 18.5% with core revenues down 16%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 11.5%, a 220 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin increased marginally on a year-over-year basis as a result of the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2008 and 2009. Product identification revenues were up 7% in the quarter with core revenues declining 1.5%. For the year, product ID sales decreased 10.5% with core revenues down 8%. Videojet’s core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the fourth quarter primarily a result of higher consumable sales. We saw sequential improvement across most geographies with the recovery in China outpacing that in the US and in Europe. While still a challenging market, we are very pleased with the performance of our refreshed CIJ product line during the quarter and we believe we continue to take share. Motion was down 24% in the quarter with core revenues down 30%. For the year, sales decreased 33.5% with core revenues down 30%. On the bright side, we saw sequential improvement in several technology and industrial end markets during the quarter primarily in the US and Asia. European end markets remain difficult. During the quarter, we received a $6 million multi-year order from a large power infrastructure supplier to provide an array of automation assemblies for a nuclear refurbishment project. And finally, moving into tools and components, revenue for the quarter decreased 9.5% with core revenues down 9%. For the year, revenues were down 18.5% with core revenues down 18%. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.5% and increased 70 basis points from the prior year due to the benefit of lower commodity costs, increased productivity, and cost savings attributable to 2008 and 2009 restructuring which helped to offset both lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Mechanics hand tool core revenues declined 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the year primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and professional channels. We were pleased with our sell-through in the quarter. Sales of our domestic China tool brand Sata grew at a double digit rate during the quarter, and in addition, our US Government business was up substantially in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect this growth to continue in 2010 with a solid backlog already in place. So, to wrap-up, we continue to execute well in a difficult but improving economic environment. Our investments in innovation, sales and marketing are driving market share gains. Our restructuring and cost reduction progress is evident in our margins. Our free cash flow remains strong and we’re putting it to good use in acquisitions and in strengthening our competitive positions and accelerating our sales and earnings growth potential. We believe we are well positioned heading into 2010 with DBS driving our focus on our performance. We are reaffirming this morning our full-year 2010 GAAP earnings per share guidance of $3.80 to $4.10. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.82 on flattish revenues. Both the full year and first quarter EPS guidance represents an approximately 8% to 15% increase over the comparable prior year periods.
Matt R. McGrew: That concludes our formal comments. We’re now ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities: So, you’re seeing some very nice trends in dental for the quarter, how much do you think is inventory and how much do you think is the genuine end market improvement, any relation to the year end budget coming through?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  Nigel I think it’s a bit of all the above to be straight. The inventory adjustments have been more pronounced for us at KaVo than at Sybron; we saw less of that in the fourth quarter, that’s now behind us. We certainly see a better uptake not only in terms of our sales in but our sales out, again, probably more so at KaVo than at Sybron as we ended the year; end of year on the equipment side often a positive or an uptake in buying; we didn’t really know how to best forecast that but we were pleasantly surprised with our results. It’s actually the most important data point for me having been at two sales meetings here in the last two weeks let along seeing a couple of weeks worth of orders, we’ve also gotten off to a good start; so, it’s not as if there’s a lot of business that got pulled forward or that was simply a year end phenomena there; I think we’re seeing a return to a more typical mindset on the parts of docs. I think we’re very much in a sweet part of the new product launch cycle as well that would apply to both KaVo and to Sybron. So, I think right now from a topline perspective, we’re not going to suggest to blow out the topline here at dental, but I think particularly at KaVo we should have a better year in 2010.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And then on KaVo, you talked about the revenue trends, can you address the margins; obviously you had a tough 2009, can you tell where they are right now and then maybe switching gears to industrial and tools margin, typically it was a sizable step down from Q3 to Q4, can you talk about that as well?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  Nigel, on the KaVo question, we did have a good Q4 at KaVo; it is seasonally the strongest quarter in terms of margins, but on a year-over-year basis, we were up about 200 basis points; we went from kind of extra restructuring mid single digits last year to high single digits, 7%, 8% in the quarter. We do benefit from some higher buying but we also got a lot of restructuring done towards the end of the year at KaVo as well, and it gives us some confidence going year end 2010.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And the margins for industrial and tools?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Tools, some of that is the incremental consumer business which is at slightly lower volumes in the fourth quarter; on the industrial segment, some sequential improvement at motion which is a lower margin than our product ID business.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, principally a mix rather than inflation.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  Yes, not atypically either.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank Securities:  And then, obviously we saw the announcement yesterday on AB Sciex, when is your best guess on getting that close and give us your best guess on the AQT launch in US and Japan?
Daniel L. Comas:  Nigel, we now have all regulatory approvals. We are finishing up a couple small final transition issues and we expect to close very shortly.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  Nigel, as you can appreciate, the authorities like us to limit what we say about timing both here in the US and in Japan. Suffice to say we’re hopeful that we’re through both those efforts at some point in 2010.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Larry, I’d be very interested in hearing your comments regarding potential restocking; you said de-stocking has run its course but based on your assessment of channel inventories, you think they stay low here for a while or are there any indications that restocking will waive this?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr. : Deane, I think it’s a little hard to call right now, but again I’m encouraged by what we’re seeing both in terms of sell out and sell in early in the year; other companies have reported as well a strong finish, an encouraging start does not a year make; but I think that will be helpful to certainly a company like ours particularly where we’re going to market through distributions. I would also add that when we turn the year like this, distributors are not necessarily going to be out aggressively loading up; we are at low levels in a number of places and in some cases probably too low; I think we like to work with a short supply chain with a number of those distributor partners so that they don’t have to blow in a lot of inventories, they can rely on our quick turn and our manufacturing capability to provide some of that, but undoubtedly some of that will seep in if we see this rising tide last for a bit longer at the start of the year.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  On that point on the start of the year, we heard that Med Tech has gotten off to a good start in January, can you just calibrate for us since the meeting at December and what experience you’ve seen so far in January across the businesses just in terms of what changes at the margin you’d call out?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr. : I think that we’ve finished a little bit better than we would have anticipated; certainly if you look at Tek and Motion businesses, it certainly felt the brunt of the downturn; they’re certainly in a good place, built backlog; we did that in Med Tech as well, more so at Leica and in dental; then we did a Radiometer; so I think that that backlog build was encouraging during the fourth quarter and I think by and large we seemingly have not missed a beat here thus far in January; again, I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself but we were thrilled to walk in with the backlog and I think even more so to see just the general pulse across the businesses. What I’m describing is really not limited to one pocket or another, its broad-based at this point; but again, it’s early.
Deane Dray - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  About backlog, we don’t normally hear Danaher talk about backlog, at the end of third quarter, you called out $100 million in backlog, how did you finish this quarter without that backlog burn through and how that might have added to the core revenue growth this quarter?
Daniel L. Comas: As Larry talked about in the prepared remarks, while the shipments were down 9%, our orders went down a couple points year-over-year, so we built another comparable about $100 million of backlog in the quarter and that’s one of the reasons as you know when we’re together in December we talked about the first quarter probably being down organically, we now are talking about it being relatively flat.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Can you give us a little more color on your first quarter outlook in terms of what businesses are doing well, what are on the soft side?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think as we talk about, again as Dan highlighted, probably a flattish outlook compared to a slightly down outlook that we had back in December. I think Med Tech is going to lead the way; it will probably be Med Tech and T&M fighting out with water slightly behind in terms of the start here. I think we’re going to have some challenges at Gilbarco and Tools; probably in industrial is where we’ll lag a bit, but again, certainly encouraged by the sequential trends; for no other reason, the exposure obviously is a little later cycle and that will down in all likelihood double digits in 2010. So, all in all, I think the businesses that led us in the fourth quarter, particularly from an orders perspective, a backlog build perspective were the ones that were going to be strong for this year and certainly getting stronger at the outset.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: What’s the balance in the first quarter of the restructuring benefit versus some of the temporary cost recoveries and possibly the cost price catch-up in terms of matching of price and materials?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  As we confirmed again today, we expect about $170 million of restructuring benefit in the full year; we’ll probably get at least a quarter of that or maybe a little bit more than that in the first quarter; it should be on a relative basis the biggest beneficiary of the restructuring benefit as we got some of the other stuff during ’09. In terms of the one-time stuff on the cost side, we talked about it being about $60 million headwin and that should be roughly $15 million a quarter; so obviously the restructuring benefit a lot more than the headwin from some of the one-time cost actions. We did see in the fourth quarter a little less price benefit and a little bit more commodity inflation, but it is hard to quantify; I think it will be a slight headwind, but it is not going to be big number for us.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital: An update on AB Sciex, both timing and accretion?
Daniel L. Comas: Bob, we have got all regulatory approvals and we expect to close this very shortly. We’re not going to provide any update beyond what we’ve already done until we get to close, and then as I said it is imminent.
Operator: We’ll take our next question comes from Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: The first question is around that core gross number again; down 9% versus where you talked about being up 4% for the full year back in December. As you look at that and you talk about the first quarter, now more flat versus your prior thoughts of it being down and the progression; it is still going to require very dramatic increase for the rest of the year. Do you see that having changed your mind as you have talked about some of the businesses?
Daniel L. Comas: I think Steve what we said in New York is we thought we would be up 1% to 5%, but we wouldn’t be positive until the second quarter. I think with the finish; again, yes we were down 9%,but keep in mind orders, and we don’t want to talk a lot about orders, but I think with the tide changing, it is important; we were probably down 2% in orders and that’s with fewer days, four fewer days, which obviously works against us in the quarter. So, I think with the order book, the backlog billed, and the start of the year, and the new news today is we think we will be flattish; I think we’ve got an outside shot at a positive number in the first quarter that simply makes it easier for us to in that 1% to 5% range or potentially higher.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: I might have missed this, but Tek specifically in Q4 was down how much?
Daniel L. Comas: Tek communications was up in the fourth quarter; Tek instruments was down comparable…
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: It was down 25% to 30% I think in the third quarter.
Daniel L. Comas: What you saw was that Tektronix was down comparable in the fourth quarter, but orders were up sequentially double digits and year-over-year was down in the mid teens and we had a significant book to bill; it was about 115% in the quarter.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Were you able to hold margins?
Daniel L. Comas: We saw, outside restructuring, Tek Instruments improved sequentially from 10% to the mid teens in the fourth quarter. You do get a little bit more seasonal lift, but a clear sign that the restructuring paid off pretty nicely there.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Something I just want to understand; you took R&D down from 5.3% to 4.9%, about 40 basis points. Your product vitality and other things; how should I think about R&D reductions?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Steve, I think you should look at it as a very modest sequential decline in terms of the dollars spent. We had a couple of programs wrapped, some of that expense went to the launch, you saw a lot of those launches highlighted in New York; I really don’t think it is particularly meaningful.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: So, there was no shift in particular businesses.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: There is no strategy shifts, there is really nothing to report behind that; that slight sequential downtick.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: On the SG&A increase, that 130 basis points, does that include the restructuring or not; the increase for SG&A?
Daniel L. Comas: That includes the restructuring. It also included, as Larry talked about the significant go to market launches with something prior to what we introduced in the mid year and the third quarter.
Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: On return on capital; that looks like it was down year-over-year again also; how should we think about that, your goals for return on capital going forward this year?
Daniel L. Comas: The decline in ’09 was clearly a function of the lower sales and lower earnings. You should see an improvement consistent with our earnings growth during the year, but factoring in that when new acquisitions come in they come in as a lower return.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan.
Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: I may have missed this, but the first quarter dynamics from an earnings perspective; is that because you’re going to take some charges when you close these deals; it just looks a little bit light from a seasonal perspective.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think Steve it is fundamentally in line with the increase for the year that we talked about back in New York. I realize that may cash some people this morning, but I don’t really think there is news there. We’re going to continue to invest as we have here in the fourth quarter in our innovation and growth activities, begin to get more of that $170 million of incremental restructuring benefit with some other costs going back into the business, but that’s just I think a clarification of what we’ll do here in the next 90 days based on what we said we would do for the full year in December.
Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: So nothing unusual, charges or anything to hold into the first quarter or like that?
Daniel L. Comas: No.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think if you look Steve at our profitability in the first quarter versus the full year over time I think on a seasonal basis it is very consistent looking back over time.
Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: I was just looking at the EPS stuff; bit of a busy morning here. Professional instrumentation very strong, but Med Tech was wide on the margins; was there anything specific in the quarter that led to that; was it a mix impact, a little bit lower than we would have expected even axing out the restructuring.
Daniel L. Comas: They did; on a reported basis they had more restructuring dollars in any segment, but if you adjusted out the restructuring they ran about 14% which was up over a 100 basis point year-over-year, and the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement came out of dental equipment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: The R&D decrease in overall spend or at least a percent of sales; should we think about that 4.9% being more or less the run rate from here or will you have to ramp up for another product cycle somewhere down the road?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think we’ll take that up in 2010 even with a little bit of a better top line environment and we don’t necessarily target that per se; we’re really trying to fund the strategy, if you will Scott, more than trying to hit a number, but as you’ve seen we’ve been taking that up with the increased emphasis there. I suspect that we will be meaningfully north of 4.9% what we were in the quarter on a full year basis. I think on a full year to full year basis we will be up modestly as a percent of sales.
Daniel L. Comas: Scott, if you look at the full year we were at 5.7% which was flat versus ’08 and it will be 5.7% or as Larry suggested a little bit higher than that in 2010.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: It’s hard for us to picture how the spend can be that volatile; it just seems like most of R&D spend would be people, and not sure how that changes quarter to quarter; is there something I am missing there?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Scott, sometimes in a project not all of the human costs, if you will, are on your payroll, third parties, contractors, and the like, programs tailing off, some of that becomes variable expense, some of that money in the P&L will go out of R&D into sales and marketing for the launch; that’s really all you’re seeing again sequentially in terms of the dollar let alone the ratio.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: That makes sense. Just a bigger picture question, but when you do make an acquisition, let’s say the size of Tektronix, I know that was your bigger one, and maybe Sciex, let’s say; how do you integrate the R&D, do you keep them decentralized and focused on specific projects or is there a way to get some scale out of that spend?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Scott, I think the way we’ve always operated it with respect to innovation and technology as well as other areas is to make sure first and foremost that that activity is very focused around that business, those customers, those applications, those problems; and then only if you will quite tactically if there are touch points, be it in optics out of Leica, microprocessing say out of tech where there is that sort of core technology capability that can be ported elsewhere, you’ll see us do that. In fact, I need to see a couple of announcements through the year, they may not be material, but I think they’ll be evidence that we are connecting some of the potential share technologies across businesses in often not so obvious ways.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley: I think I understand; it’s more application specific R&D, and where you can cross pollinate, you do so; is that what you’re saying?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Whether we’re at Hach solving water quality challenges or at tech in test and measurement, we want those folks first and foremost focused on their customers and those applications. We don’t run a corporate R&D center, but what we do is to make sure that where there is challenge in one business and a potential solution in another, then with a light touch we bring those folks together to see if there is something there; again a light touch, not a big corporate apparatus.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Baliotti - FTN Equity Capital Markets.
John Baliotti - FTN Equity Capital Markets: I was just curious; you said you closed 43 facilities and the market seems to be having this generalization that customers are going to start inventories back, and your base of locations is obviously smaller. So, you individually, I wouldn’t expect to be certainly not out of the gate ramping up your inventories, your CapEx to where you were entering this downturn, right?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think that’s fair.
John Baliotti - FTN Equity Capital Markets: Right, and you guys are pretty realistic and pretty concerned; I would imagine that you’re expecting your customers to act much differently than they are right now?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: It’s hard to generalize, but I think again, with the finish and with the start, lots of people I talked to are becoming more confident about what could happen in 2010.
John Baliotti - FTN Equity Capital Markets: If you look at durables and so on, so far the trends have been that orders are turning into shipments right away, that the backlogs really aren’t being filled; I guess what I am saying is that it seems like you guys are pretty realistic about the expectations given your own patterns and probably your better customers acting pretty efficiently, pretty prudent; is that…
Daniel L. Comas: I would rather think that we are taking a prudent approach to thinking about the sequential ramp; the scenarios that could occur in 2010, not getting too far ahead of ourselves, but at the same time making sure we’re not so conservative that we don’t have the labor plan or the material plan in place to catch the wave, whatever size it may come in.
John Baliotti - FTN Equity Capital Markets: I can appreciate that; I am just thinking, looking at all that you’ve done to the portfolio over the last five to ten years, as you’re going through this, what are you thinking the profile of the firm looks like, of your company looks like; let’s say through this next cycle, is it higher core growth, is it more offsetting cyclicality, is it steadier longer-term growth; as you’re going through options, how do you think about what the eventual look would be?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think what we’ve tried to do with the moves, say since the last five years or even the moves we made in 2009, John, is to make sure that first and foremost that if we were never to do another acquisition that we have a high growth, high margin, innovative science and technology oriented portfolio that can perform over the long term, and I think that very much is in place. Certainly, as we look forward, we have an opportunity to do quite well from a core growth perspective given what we have done both from a product and a go to market side. With respect to acquisitions, if you look over the last year, the last five years, I do believe that we have improved the quality and capability of this company. So, we’ll look to add like-type business, again with an emphasis towards higher growth, higher margin, more global, more technical businesses where our DBS skill sets are applicable and gain value.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Inch - Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: I want to go back to the first quarter dynamic; historically your first quarter is about 20% of your year and if you take the mid point, $0.80 and the mid point of your guide of $3.95, it would be $0.20, but the first quarter had flat organic revenues; you were thinking you were going to do up and even in your analysts appendix roll forward, there was $0.10 to $0.40 of contribution from the positive organic trend that is coming beyond the first quarter, and then I think Dan you even called out the fact that the cost headwinds were going to be linear, equally spread; I am just trying to understand, why would the first quarter not be low relative to the sequential ramp which you’re actually expecting but which is not really embedded in the dynamic of the first quarter being 20% of the mid point.
Daniel L. Comas: One thing I did say is on a relative basis Q1 will be the biggest beneficiary of the 2009 restructuring.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Yes, you did; how much is that?
Daniel L. Comas: That’s probably a penny or so, a penny or two. Our full year guidance is at 2.5% to 3% core and we’ve got zero here; that cost is a couple of cents from a follow-through perspective, but that should be roughly offset with the restructuring, and it is early in the year; so that’s kind of our best look at this point. If we thought organic was going to be down the first quarter, our Q1 guidance would have been a little bit lower. So, we think it captures it at best as we can at this point, but I understand the question and the point.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: But you’re still expecting to get, call it $0.25 at the mid point from core growth spread over the next three quarters, right?
Daniel L. Comas: We had an exceptionally strong margin performance across the business in Q4; sort of our confidence that we can replicate that the next quarter is pretty high, but going out four quarters, there are more unknowns and probably we factored that in a little bit as well.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: That’s fine, I am just trying to gauge and make sure that there is nothing else unusual, that you’re just being conservative. The following question really is; what’s going on in Europe, if I remember last year, Europe all of a sudden deteriorated for you and I think a lot of it, somewhat on a relative basis, deteriorated for you and I think it has to do a little bit with your mix; what are you seeing in Europe versus in terms of the sequential; how does that look with your outlook for the year?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: John, I would say that what we’re seeing in Europe broadly defined is just a more slower, maybe a more sluggish sequential improvement; I wouldn’t say it is universal in every single one of our businesses, but it is not coming back. If I look at China, if I look at India, it has come back during the second half very strongly; the US has been getting better month to month, but not nearly and as pronounced a way in Europe. Europe is just in that third slot, it’s just getting better, but on a relative basis much more slowly.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Is there any reason to think it could pick up for any reason based on your business mix or other trends or do you think it is just going to lag throughout the year?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think there is a potential for Europe to lag, more of a Macro call than a Danaher call, but I would think it would be hard for Europe to sit out what appears to be strengthening outlook for the global economy at least here in the early half, the first half of 2010.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: I am sorry Larry, you talking about Danaher or about Macro Europe?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I am talking about Macro Europe and obviously it has got a big footprint there, John. I think if you were to look at the emerging markets, the US, and Europe as your three big buckets of growth potential or improvement, I think Europe will be in that third slot when all said and done for 2010, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t getting better; it’s just getting better at a slower relative rate.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: I understand, and that’s consistent with what you’re seeing on your order book; that’s what you’re saying?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: Indeed.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague - Citi Investment Research.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citi Investment Research: I actually have a couple of questions left despite people asking five or six at a time on the call here. Larry, two strategic type of questions; I know this MDS thing is probably a tad sensitive, but were you surprised given that the concentration was only going to take the players from four down to three that there was an FTC objection, and I am really asking that even from a bigger picture type of things; when some of these sub-niches that you’re carving out in Med Tech, is there concentration issues that maybe are going to make the navigation of the M&A a little bit more difficult?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think what I can share Jeff is we had a productive conversation with the authorities. As Dan indicated, that has come to a positive conclusion, and I suspect that going forward we may well have other light conversations, but I think we’ll continue to be an active acquirer this year in and around the businesses that we highlighted in December, and I don’t really see any reason to think that the landscape has changed in a way that will prevent us from continuing to put our acquisition capital to good use in the neighborhood.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citi Investment Research: On the flip side, on the divestiture side, those sound small, but what’s the circumstance there? Are you guys actually getting some reverse enquiry from people who know what’s non-core to Danaher and expressing some interest or are you actively looking to prune a few things?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I would say Jeff, it’s more the latter; there are certainly things on the margins that we thought might be in better hands elsewhere, and with the economy stabilizing, this is probably a better time for us to do that here at year’s end, and obviously there were some folks who were keen to be the counterparty if you will. It is probably important strategically more so than it is financially, but I would suspect we will continue to look for those opportunities where we can over time.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citi Investment Research: What was the annualized revenue divestiture that you completed?
Daniel L. Comas: About $50 million.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: The first question I think is to do with your consumable business; you talked about strength on the Videojet side, but across your portfolio, your consumables seem to have held up quite well during the downturn, but could you discuss the pricing; could you discuss whether there was pushback on pricing or what the sustainability was, particularly in the product ID side, but also in the other businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: I think with respect to pricing, as Dan indicated, we were positive again in the fourth quarter, but we’ve seen sequential softening through the second half. I think by and large the consumables, and frankly our entire after market exposure which is about 30% of our business now has held up pretty well. Is it sustainable, frankly I think we have seen in the downturn, let alone in good times that we can get price in the after market across the business, not only at Videojet but at Hach and with the medical businesses; I would suspect that going forward, we’ll be smart about price and should get it. I guess that makes it sustainable.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: The second question would just be regarding your M&A on a go-forward basis, you talked about continuing to be active there; over the past decade you’ve diversified internationally quite substantially, but where you are right now, do you think that is still a focus to further diversify your business internationally or do you think that right now the activity is likely to be equal and that’s not really your focus anymore?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: In terms of the international exposure?
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes, the international exposure.
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.:  I think that you’ll continue to see us both organically and inorganically focus our energies globally with a particular emphasis as many companies are on the emerging markets. When I look at our new product cycles, I look at some of our localization efforts in China and India; I’m very encouraged by the progress in that regard; you heard us talk about a Brazilian acquisition this year, we’re working on and hopefully soon we’ll complete the Indian acquisition of Gilbarco Veeder-Root; so, we’re going at those markets aggressively inorganically as well as organically and clearly there will be a bigger part of our business I suspect, a bigger portion of overall revenue every year going forward.
Operator:  We’ll take our final question from Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Larry, when I look out to calendar 2010, when I look at the midpoint of the EPS guidance back up to the operating margin line, it looks like may be you need about 120 basis points of improvement there year-over-year; with all the puts and takes, which platform is absorbing restructuring cost, if you just look at the four platforms, can you just characterize which of the four you would expect the greatest margin improvement to occur given the trailing restructuring efforts are largely complete?
H. Lawrence Culp Jr.: We think that it will be pretty broad-based. I think if you looked at the ’09 margins and you back out the incremental restructuring, we ended the year probably about 15%. I think to get to the midpoint, we have about 2.5%, 3% organic growth, I think we need more like 70 or 80 basis points of core margin improvement. I should be most pronounced in medical technologies and biggest driver of that hopefully we’re encouraged by what we saw here in Q4 will be KaVo, but also should see some nice lift at Leica as well. The second largest contributor should be industrial tech and professional instrumentation and tools will be probably the lowest; we have a low bar here for Q1 in tools, but thereafter, we’ve got a pretty touch comp; suspect for the full year, tools and components could be the smallest year-over-year contributor, but it’s also as you know the small segment.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Dan, as you referenced earlier, the Med Tech piece in the fourth quarter excluding the restructuring was around 14%?
Daniel L. Comas:  Yes.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Is that a margin that we can hold?
Daniel L. Comas:  There are lot of one-time costs coming in, but absent that, we would expect well over 100 basis points year-over-year margin improvement in Med Tech; now the 14% is we do get the seasonal volume lift in Med Tech but it might not be a bad target overall again outside Sciex.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Lastly on price, are we treating that as neutral for the time or are we going to attempt to get some gain on it?
Daniel L. Comas:  We still have got a point of price here in Q4 and we think price will be positive in 2010.
Operator:  There are no further questions at this moment.

H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : We’ll start this morning by providing an overview of what we are seeing across our businesses and end market to lay a frame work for our quarterly results and our outlook for the balance of the year. We are pleased with how we are executing in a stabilizing yet still challenging economy. Results within our professional instrumentation segment were essentially in line with our overall business results. Environmental continues to be relatively resilient while test and measurement saw sequential improvement though overall remains weak. Our medical technologies segment with the exception of KaVo largely outperformed as a result of its high consumables mix. The industrial technologies segment absent our niche aerospace and defense businesses improved sequentially particularly in North America while tools and components businesses continued to experience soft demand. Even in this environment we continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share Videojet, ChemTreat, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, DEXIS, Radiometer and Matco are among the businesses where we believe we have taken notable share from competition. Geographically, China was our best performer with mid single digit revenue growth in the quarter. Europe and the emerging economies continued to be very soft while the US saw modest sequential improvement in many end markets. Our margin performance was again strong in the third quarter with our core operating margins improving sequentially by 140 basis points from 14.2% in the second quarter to 15.6% in the third. In addition, each segment saw sequential improvements in core margins.  Additionally, our cash flow was once again robust as we generated $472 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Despite the incremental restructuring costs and lower volumes experienced across our businesses, year-to-date free cash flow was down only modestly. During the quarter we announced a top up to our previously communicated 2009 restructuring initiatives which are now expected to approximately $250 million and are expected to provide annual cost savings of approximately $220 million.  With that as a backdrop let’s move to the details of the quarter. We reported today third quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.05 representing a 5.5% decrease from last year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.89 which was $0.02 above the high end of the $0.77 to $0.87 adjusted EPS guidance range we provided in July. Revenues for the quarter decreased 14.5% year-over-year to $2.75 billion with core revenues down 14%. The impact of currency translations reduced revenues by 2% offset by acquisitions which contributed 1.5% to sales growth. Across our businesses orders solidly outpaced shipments as we built approximately $100 million of backlog during the quarter. Year-over-year gross margins for the third quarter increased 90 basis points to 48% largely due to year-over-year cost savings relating to our restructuring initiatives and ongoing cost reduction efforts as well as lower commodity costs which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and additional restructuring costs in 2009.  Operating margin in the third quarter increased 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%. With lower sales volumes across most businesses and the impact of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs more than offset by a onetime gain resulting from the litigation settlement with Align Technology and the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities.  Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 19.1% as compared to 24.5% in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by discreet tax benefits of $37 million or $0.11 per share related to the favorable resolution of various international and domestic tax matters which was previously included in our guidance for the quarter. For the balance of the year we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Operating cash flows for the third quarter were $503 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. For the first nine months operating cash flows were $1.3 billion, a 3% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $472 million and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 134%. Our year-to-date cash flow performance includes $136 million of cash payments as a result of our restructuring initiatives. Of particular note, we reduced inventories by over $113 million or 10% year-to-date which is roughly in line with our core sales decline of 13%. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will remain strong over the balance of the year and as a result we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 18th year in a row.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition of six companies with aggregate annual revenues of about $130 million to strengthen our environment, test and measurement, product identification and dental businesses. We also announced our intention to acquire AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and [Paladex]], all of which we anticipate closing in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to deploy capital in this environment and are encouraged by our active opportunities.  Now, turning to our operating segments perpetual instrumentational revenues decreased 12.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 13.5%. For the first nine months of 2009 revenues decreased 14% with core revenues down 13.5%. Operating margin for the third quarter declined 450 basis points to 15.6% primarily due to lower sales volumes and the incremental impact of year-over-year restructuring costs incurred during the quarter.  Our environmental platform revenues declined 2.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 2%. For the first nine months revenues decreased 2.5% with core revenues down 1% year-over-year. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single digit rate during the quarter. At Hach Lange core revenues declined at a low single digit rate but with lab and processing sales improving sequentially from the prior quarter due to an increase in project activity. Despite the top lines declines and prior year restructuring costs, Hach Lange’s operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points over last year.  Trojan’s core revenues grew at a double digit revenue rate during the quarter with strong growth in waste water applications as well as continued shipments for the New York City drinking water project. ChemTreat’s revenues were up low single digits year-over-year driven by sales of our boiler cooler water applications. New account generation continues to be robust and we believe we are capturing share in many of our end markets.  During the quarter we acquired [Inaudible] Scientifica a Brazilian based distributor of laboratory instruments, microbiology products and basic lab equipment. [Hexis] is the primary distributor of Hach Lange products in this strategically important emerging economy. Also in the quarter we acquired Para-Chem Technology, a US based provider of geothermal solutions for steam, brine and cooling water systems. The geothermal segment is an attractive adjacency for ChemTreat and provides access to end markets poised for accelerated growth in the coming years as demand for clean and renewable energy increases. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues declined at a high single digit rate year-over-year. At Gilbarco sales declined at a low single digit rate as continued growth in our passport point-of-sale systems was more than offset by lower dispenser sales principally in Europe. Veeder-Root sales were down in the quarter with sales of our enhanced vapor recovery solution slowing in advance of the yearend implementation deadline in California. Moving to test and measurement, revenues declined 23.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 25.5%. Fluke, Tektronix and Fluke Networks all improved sequentially from the previous quarter with signs of stabilization in the US and China while Europe continues to experience weak demand. For the first nine months of 2009 core revenues decreased 25.5%. Fluke core revenues declined at a mid teen rate in the quarter with sales decline of core test products in Europe more than offsetting growth in China. Across Asia we shipped more than 100 thermography units which are being used for H1N1 flu detection at airports and schools. In the US we believe that the inventory reductions in the distribution channel are largely behind us. During the quarter Fluke launched a series of new important products including the 233 digital remote display multi meter with wireless capabilities and the TI31 thermal imaginer thermography at the mid price point range. At Tektronix, sales were down across all product categories and geographies as customers continued to delay investments. Like Fluke, we believe we have worked through the US distributor destocking issues and in the third quarter our orders improved at a high single digit rate over the second quarter.  Sales from our Fluke Networks and Tek Communications businesses collectively declined at a double digit rate partially due to a difficult year-over-year comparison at Tech Communications which benefited from a large Australian network management shipment last year. During the quarter we acquired AirMagnet a leading enterprise Wi-Fi analysis and security provider based in California. This business compliments Fluke Networks by providing chronic leadership in wireless test solutions. Moving to med tech revenues for the quarter decreased 8% compared to 2008 with core revenues down 8.5%. For the first nine months of 2009 revenues decreased 9% with core revenues down 6%. Med tech operating margin for the third quarter was up 960 basis points from the prior year to 21.9% due primarily to the one time litigation settlement gain. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin was essentially flat versus the prior year.  Within our dental business, core revenues declined at a mid teens rate in the quarter. Sybron core sales were relatively flat in the quarter with higher sales of our orthodontia solutions and disinfection product lines offset by soft sales of general dentistry consumables. Sybron enjoyed mid single digit growth in orthodontics driven by a strong response to our new [inaudible] product which provides dentists greater treatment flexibility, easier wire change overs and a smaller bracket profile for improved patient aesthetics. During the quarter Ormco announced an exclusive collaboration arrangement with Align technology to jointly develop and market an orthodontic solution combining Align’s Invisalign system and Ormco’s Insignia custom orthodontic bracket and arch wire system. We remain very excited about this strategic opportunity. Cable revenues declined at a double digit rate in the quarter with weak demand across the major geographies and product categories as dentists continued to delay capital spending. In addition, channel inventory reductions continue in center geographies.  In the quarter DEXIS launched its new platinum sensor which has the ability to take vertical and horizontal bitewing x-rays with a single sensor thus eliminating the cost and inconvenience of using multiple sensors. While the environment remains challenging we are encouraged by the cost actions we have taken and with the recent number of new products. We believe that we will see sequential improvement in both top and bottom line performance in the fourth quarter.  During the quarter we announced the acquisition of [Access] Dental a leader in dental rotary instrumentation. [Access] provides Sybron with a strong sales force, an established brand and valuable channel relationships in the sizeable rotary segment. Subsequent to quarter end we also announced our intention to acquire [Paladex] Holdings, a finished base manufacturer of dental imaging products. With the pending addition of Instumentarium Dental and SOREDEX we will add two strong brands to our imaging group which is expected to strengthen our product portfolio in all key categories of digital imaging. This acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Leica’s core revenues declined at a mid single digit rate in the quarter with strength across Asia more than offset by weak demand in the US and European industrial and life science research markets. During the quarter Leica received a $10 million microscopy order in Japan, the largest single order in the company’s history. This was a great win for the team in a region where we have significant local competition. The order will begin shipping in the fourth quarter and will continue in to next year.  In addition, Leica launched the SCN 400, a new digital pathology slide scanner during the quarter and additional feedback in the US and in Europe has been quite positive. Recent reports from our sales team indicate that orders related to US stimulus funding have increased sequentially however shipments have only begun to materialize. Leica Biosystems’ core revenues were essentially flat in the quarter with strong growth of our advanced staining consumables offset by soft instrument sales.  In Europe distributor inventory levels were adversely impacted pending launch of the new BOND-III system which is due out this month. The BOND-III advanced staining system provides faster staining capability, greater flexibility and increased efficiency to the histologist.  Radiometer’s core revenues were at a mid single digit rate for the quarter driven by continued strong consumable sales primarily in Europe and Asia resulting from past success in growing our install base. In Asia sales benefitted from double digit growth in Japan as well as the recent launch of the ABL80 compact blood gas analyzer in China. In the quarter we announced the pending acquisition of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices. As a reminder, AB Sciex is a leading designer and manufacturer of mass spectrometers used by researchers and clinicians to identify and quantify specific molecules in complex samples. Molecular Devices provides high performance bio analytical instruments and consumables that accelerate and improve research productivity and effectiveness in life science research and drug discovery.  The acquired businesses will expand med tech annual revenues by more than $650 million to nearly $4 billion. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions but we believe we are on track for closing in the fourth quarter.  Moving to industrial technologies, revenues declined 20% for the quarter with core revenues down 18%. For the first nine months of 2009 revenues decreased 21.5% with core revenues down 16.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 17%, a 120 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower sales volumes across the segment as well as incremental restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Product ID revenues were down 11% in the quarter with core revenues decline 8.5%. For the first nine months product ID sales decreased 15.5% with core revenues down 9.5%. In Videojet we have begun to see stabilization across most geographies with printer placements improving sequentially from the prior quarter. We launched the 1610 small character continuous inkjet printer ideal for high speed application in the quarter, the third version of our 1000 series product platform. While it’s still early market feedback is again, for this new product, being quite positive. During the quarter we acquired FOBA Technology, a German based manufacturer of laser based marking and engraving systems. Though the strength in Videojet’s channel in Europe and North America in core parts marking applications it increase its exposure to fast growing niche verticals such as medical and smart cards. Also in the quarter we acquired Wolke inks and printers based in [Harris Brook] Germany. Wolke markets a leading thermal inkjet printer with significant channel presence with major pharmaceutical customer and OEM. The business expands Videojet’s presence in the attractive pharmaceutical vertical market with specific functionality targeting track and trace applications. Motion revenues were down 34% in the quarter with core revenues down 30.5%. Year-to-date sales decreased 36.5% with core revenues down 30%. We saw sequential improvement in several end markets during the quarter including electronic assembly, semiconductors and elevators particularly in the US though overall levels are still soft. European end markets did not show the same sequential improvement as customer factory shutdowns across Germany continue to impact performance. During the quarter Kollmorgan launched the AKM Servo family of drives designed to expand machine performance and increase integration speeds with easy to use plug and play compatibility with Kollmorgan motors. Customer feedback has been very favorable here as well. Finally, moving to tools and components, revenues for the quarter decreased 20.5% with core revenues down 20%. Year-to-date revenues decreased 21.5% with core revenues down 21%. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.6% an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year due to the benefit of lower commodity costs, increased productivity and cost savings attributable to prior year restructuring initiatives which helped offset both lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter.  Mechanics hand tool core revenues declined 16% in the third quarter and 11.5% year-to-date primarily due to lower sales to both consumer and professional channels. Performance in the third quarter was also negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison with the Advanced Auto stocking order which occurred in the prior year period. Sales of our domestic China tool brand [Sada] grew at a low single digit rate during the quarter.  To wrap up, we continue to execute well in a difficult economic environment. Our investments in innovation, sales and marketing are clearly driving market share gains. Our restructuring and cost reduction process is evident in our margins. Our free cash flow remains strong and we’re putting it to use in acquisitions and in strengthening our competitive positions and accelerating our sales and earnings growth potential. We strongly believe that we will emerge from this downturn as an even stronger and more competitive company in 2010 and beyond. Our expectation is for the fourth quarter core revenues to be down about 10%, a sequential improvement from the third quarter notwithstanding four fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. Given our strong performance in the third quarter we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook from $3.28 to $3.48 per share to $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share outlook is now $0.99 to $1.09. The additional restructuring charges that we approved in April and August are expected to reduce GAAP EPS by approximately $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.45 per share for the full year. As a result, we expect our GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter 2009 to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.75. For the full year 2009 we expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.41. These ranges include the additional restructuring items just mentioned but exclude the impact of acquisition related costs for deals we have not yet announced resulting from the adoption of the new business combination accountings standard that went in to effect in 2009.
Matt R. McGrew : That concludes our formal comments, we’re not ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: A couple of questions, first would be just give us a sense of how the month of September tracked versus your earlier comments in the quarter that July and August had done well or just above expectations? Then if you could, you don’t often comment about backlog and I’m interested to hear more about that $100 million in backlog. Would that be contributing to core revenues or just what’s the mix within that backlog?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Dean, I think as we look at September, it more or less played out as we had anticipated and certainly had hoped. We really went I think wire-to-wire through the quarter with good in flow. We certainly saw I think some of the destocking early in the quarter but that was a firm dynamic throughout. I think we kept waiting for Europe to show itself in September a little stronger in line with what we were certainly seeing in the US and certainly in China and India and that really didn’t materialize but I don’t think we were expecting that. I think all-in-all we were pretty pleased with the way the quarter started and certainly with the way it ended. With respect to the backlog clearly we don’t talk about that a lot but certainly there’s a lot of interest out there with what’s happening sequentially with the current book of business so we threw that out there just to provide a little bit more color. Certainly, building backlog as we did during the quarter would suggest that our order books were up year-over-year more strongly than the core revenue number that we printed and we’re certainly encouraged by that particularly given that we built some backlog in some businesses that have really felt the full brunt of the downturn like test and measurement. All-in-all I think it’s one data point among several that suggests we do have a stabilizing economy in hand and the business is by in large pretty well in it.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: Larry, just to clarify, within the composition of that backlog will that all flow through core revenues or is there a mix in there?
Daniel L. Comas : That will all come in the next couple of quarters.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : When we ship it will be core.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: Then just lastly, the commentary about gaining market share and you gave a full array of businesses and maybe it’s tough to generalize but how much of that is coming from new product launches or is it pricing competition or maybe even some of your weakened competitors? How would you characterize that?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think it’s tough to paint the full parade chart out. I would not attribute much to pricing or us being advantage vis-à-vis weaker competitors as a result of the economy. I think it really comes down to two things and it’s hard to quantify but clearly we’re in a very good place with our new product launch cycle. You’ve heard us talk about the new products at Videojet as one example, this new DEXIS sensor, it’s something that we’re very excited about. Gilbarco has done a great job both with the point-of-sale program which we call Passport and what they’ve done with advance vapor recovery.    You heard in our prepared remarks a number of new products coming to market here in the fourth quarter, the slide scanner at Leica and other exciting technology we’re going to bring to market so that’s one big piece. The other is a lot of what we’ve done I think to improve our go to market. Making sure that we’re protecting our spend in that area as we have obviously cut dramatically throughout the organization elsewhere. You see that ChemTreat, we’re just putting feet on the street, good selling execution there is helping us. I think you see that with the improvements that we’re seeing at Videojet. Certainly what we’ve been able to do in some of our international markets I would attribute to just better sales and marketing execution as those growth tools within DBS I think get greater traction across Danaher.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: Just the down $0.10 called for 4Q, you called out the four fewer selling days, it was four not three right?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Yes, four.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: What impact is that having? It seems if I just do some back of the envelop calculations it’s maybe a seven point impact from the sales days but could you just maybe try and put some numbers around that please?
Daniel L. Comas : It’s a little hard to calculate. I think you could mathematically say that it’s four or five points. I don’t think it’s that much. It has more of an impact on the consumable business which is kind of more of a daily order run rate business less on kind of the capital purchases. My guess is it is a two to three point impact if you want to quantify but I don’t think it’s the full mathematical impact.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: Then you just called out the fact that the consumables business will be hit harder than the equipment businesses is. Obviously consumables is higher margin, does that mean we should expect maybe a bit more pressure on the gross margin in 4Q?
Daniel L. Comas : No, I think we’re very pleased with our sequential improvement in margins and I think we’ll see another improvement in core margins here in Q4. I haven’t looked enough at the gross margin mix for Q4 but I don’t think it will be that much of an impact.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: Do you want to give maybe a bit of detail on the segment by segment core revenue outlook for 4Q?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think from a revenue perspective Nigel we just look at it from a segment perspective. I think we’ve got the potential for instrumentation to be a little bit better. I think that med tech should be significantly better in part because we’re going to get through a lot of the stocking that we’ve seen around KaVo. I think industrial will probably be in line, maybe a little better and I think tools will be better if for no other reason because of the absence of the Advance Auto comp that we talked about in the prepare remarks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: Previously you had been saying that you had about $160 million of cost savings I think rolling over in to 2010. We’ve done more in the way of restructuring, maybe you can just go in to a little bit of detail about maybe what you’ve been doing on all of this restructuring. I think yo8u had programs that started in last year’s fourth quarter where [inaudible] ratchet them up over the course of this year and you had increment in the current quarter. What is the outlook for 2010 in terms of a short term benefit? And, maybe a little more color on what’s been going on with all these restructuring programs?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Let me just provide a couple of key points. I’d start with just reminding everybody that we’re always in restructuring mode. We’re always looking to take cost [inaudible] out of the business. That’s a key tenant in the Danaher business system. We celebrated that activity beginning late last year, you saw us call that out as we did in the fourth quarter. With the program that has been further accelerated during the course of the year, we’re going to end up spending the better part of $250 million this year on top of the $80 plus we did last year so we’re talking about an investment all up of approximately $320 million. What we’ve done is obviously exited a number of positions out of the organization as well as reduced our overall footprint both in manufacturing and in selling and other administrative activities. If you look from a facility count we’re going to end up being down 42 rooftops when this program is over. We will have exited about 10% of our associate population, about 5,100 jobs. But again, I think we feel optimistic that the execution has gone well this year, that’s why we topped it up a few months ago yet again and see that really occupying our activity really through the rest of the year. We’ll try to protect obviously selling and R&D as best we can and root out the waste and unnecessary capacity everywhere else. I don’t think Bob you should expect to see us top this up yet again this year. I think it’s our hope that as the economy stabilizes we’re not talking about these sorts of call outs next year but that we will perhaps get back to a quite restructuring, pay as you go sort of activity that you see us implement in more normal times.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: You mentioned stocking and destocking a couple of times in discussing various businesses. Where would you characterize the whole destocking phenomena when you look across the whole portfolio of Danaher businesses and are you in fact benefitting a little bit from some restocking in some businesses? How would you characterize that evolution in stocking and destocking?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think on balance we are certainly being helped by the end of the destocking but I don’t think we’ve yet seen a material positive effect from restocking. I mean certainly in environmental we don’t do a lot of distribution, much of what we do is direct at Hach Lange, there’s some where obviously distribution is more important as in Gilbarco Veeder-Root. I don’t think we’ve seen a positive benefit there. Certainly the absence of some of these dramatic declines in test and measurement as we indicated are going to help Fluke and Tek even before we see a pick up.  I think med tech is certainly where we have seen the most dramatic perhaps inventory reductions in the channel particularly around KaVo and to a less degree at Sybron. But, even Sybron felt a little bit of that around the consumables business here in the third quarter. I guess the sell out numbers at retail were certainly better in the US than our sell in numbers. [Inaudible] by in large a direct business, that doesn’t apply thought internationally we’ve certainly seen some of the smaller distributors take down consumables.  Motion we’ve certainly seen it but again no positive effect yet from any restock and tools has certainly felt it both in industrial distribution and at retail. But again, I think net-net we welcome the stability. We await the restock but are really watching sell through at this point to see when the real uptick will present itself.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: The final question for me, how would you characterize the benefit to Danaher from holding price relative to some of the commodity price declines you’ve seen in the last nine months relative to any hedges you have in place? I mean, are we still getting a bit of a tailwind there or how is that working?
Daniel L. Comas : We are and you can see it most notably Bob in the tool margins where our core margins were up 300 basis points year-on-year. The tailwind was less in Q3 than it was in Q2 and it will be less in the coming quarters. I would note that the core margin increase in tools probably about half of that is commodity benefit but half of that is execution so we’re not going to see the big multi hundred point improvement in margins in tools because it’s going to become much less of a tailwind commodities. But, I think because of execution we’re still going to do fine from a margin perspective there.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: How come you guys haven’t gotten more pressure to give up price in some of those markets?
Daniel L. Comas : I would say we have a little bit. Our overall price has gone from 1.5 to more like a point or .2. That is a sign that we’re still getting roughly the same amount of price in consumables but more the industrial equipment products we’re getting a little bit less price. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Could you give us an update view of your thoughts around capacity for new acquisitions coming up over the next couple of quarters given the $1.6 of cash that you’ve now got and the CP lines?
Daniel L. Comas : Of the $1.6 that we ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in spoken for between MDS and the [Paladex] deal, both of which are signed and announced but not closed. But I mean, If you just look at our next five quarters of cash flow, our $1 billion of capacity under commercial paper, it’s probably well north of $2 billion in the next three or four quarters without even having to think about really having to raise any term debt or impact to our credit rating.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: As you talk about MDS, given the complex deal structure is that closing still on track timing wise?
Daniel L. Comas : Yes, we just got shareholder approval at MDS. There was some regulatory approvals we’re waiting for the we think are coming shortly and we’re still confident there will be a fourth quarter closing.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Is the environment, the bid ask spreads that are out there continue to improve to your favor?
Daniel L. Comas : I would say the fact that we’ve signed eight deals in the last eight weeks is a positive sign and I think a number of discussions we are having right now are encouraging.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: If you look at the impact of acquisitions in your free cash flow for the quarter can you give us some color about that?
Daniel L. Comas : I’d have to look at it. We actually have a little bit of a negative now because under the new accounting rules your expenses run through your cash flow but I can look up that off line Steve. I don’t think it’s a big impact because we didn’t have a lot of acquisitions the last three or four quarters and the deals we just closed we closed late in September so I don’t think they had much of an impact to Q3 cash flow.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: As we look at the sequential changes in the sub reported business segments from the second quarter to the third quarter and the first, that dental business again endodontic and consumables is what’s dragging that down versus orthodontics and infection because that’s the one that is down mid teens now versus low double digits from last quarter?
Daniel L. Comas : We probably weren’t as clear as we could have been in the stick. The Sybron business was essentially flat in the quarter and ortho was up a little bit, general dentistry was down, the equipment business was down 20% and that blended to a down low teens.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: And the equipment business you’re explaining mostly through inventory destocking still?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, I think the first issue there Steve clearly is a lower level of spend particularly for big ticket items both in the US and Europe. I think that coupled with the destocking that we’re seeing this year are I think the two primary reasons why we’re down the way that we are. But again, I think we have a lot of improvement opportunities in front of us at KaVo. I’m encouraged by what I’ve seen. I was in with the team in Europe two weeks ago, I’m with the team in the US in fact, tomorrow. I think we’re beginning to get the traction I’d like to see us having in that business.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: A final comment on Tek margins would be helpful.
Daniel L. Comas : The Tek margins absent restructuring were comparable to Q2, just low double digit. We believe they’re going to move sequentially to mid teens here in the fourth quarter again, absent restructuring.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague – Citigroup.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Could we just follow up a little bit more on restructuring Larry or Dan and just help us thinking about the benefit variance as we move from ’09 to 2010?
Daniel L. Comas : Jeff, the way we’re looking at is of the $250 million spend this year, there’s an annualized benefit of $220. Roughly a quarter of that we’re going to get in the second half or let’s call it $60 million in the second half. We’re pleased with what we got in the third quarter and we think we’re tracking well in that regard. And, we’ll get about $150 to $160 million benefit rolling forward in to 2010.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: That’s the incremental on top of the $60?
Daniel L. Comas : Yes. So, $220 total, $60 this year, $160 left over for next year.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: And I see there’s a comment in the Q that some of this $250 maybe actually doesn’t get spent or executed on until the first half of next year. Does that weight those benefits then for next year more in to the second half or does that kind of come through in a linear fashion over the course of the year?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think that’s right. I think as we’ve tried to highlight we think we’ve bitten off a lot here to get done. Some of it may spill in to early next year in terms of the spend and if we execute on that path clearly some of the benefit will be more back loaded and potentially a little less. But, I think we are pleased with the execution we’ve seen through nine months. There’s a lot of work to do here in the fourth quarter and we’re hopeful we’ll get through that but it will be tight which is why we flagged it again in the Q.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Is there any spillover benefit in to 2010 from the $80 million of ’08 actions?
Daniel L. Comas : Very little. I mean, we thought we’d get $100 million this year and we’re tracking awfully close to that. 
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Larry when you were just piecing together kind of the GAAP walk on guidance, can you just true us up maybe Dan on just kind of the tax items? You said tax 25% in Q4 so there’s no more unusual in tax?
Daniel L. Comas : That’s correct. In the fourth quarter, and we have posted this on our website, kind of a quarter-by-quarter look with the onetime items, we’ll have about $0.30 of restructuring in the fourth quarter and probably about $0.04 of M&A expense and that’s primarily the deal expenses on the [Paladex] and the AB Sciex deal. So, at the midpoint of $1.04 of adjusted EPS you have $0.70 GAAP EPS adding back to get to adjusted $0.30 of restructuring and $0.04 of M&A expense.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Just on deals, just the complexion of things like as you said Dan, eight deals in eight weeks. Obviously AB Sciex is sizeable but is there anything to glean here from what we’ve seen? Should we expect to see a lot of little deals, is that’s what’s breaking free or are there actual sizeable things in the pipeline?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Jeff, I think what you’re seeing is another frankly typical Danaher acquisition year where you’re going to have a couple of big deals and we put the [inaudible] of pairing in that zone, some smaller situations and a number of bolt ons to put together an average year of 12 to 15 deals. I think that distribution is shaping up as it has in years past but the six deals that we have flagged here that some of you may have not known about that we closed out in the quarter tended to be our bread and butter but there certainly are some larger situations still very much percolating in the M&A process that we’re optimistic about.
Daniel L. Comas : I’m not sure you can glean too much prospectively but of the six deals closed and the two deals pending the collective purchase price is about 1.5 times revenue which is lower than the last couple of years. Now, part of that reflects lower margins given the downturn but that often bodes well from a return perspective is going in at a little lower revenue multiple. 
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Just kind of maybe one other thing that’s got two parts, I think all companies here are kind of struggling with trying to get their arms around what costs actually come back. Everybody has leaned on 401k and merit raise and all kinds of things as we’ve progressed through ’09. I’m sure you’re looking at some commodity cost pressure in to 2010 and is there anything else that just kind of leads in that we should be thinking about as we’re thinking about this kind of restructuring walk that we talked about a little bit earlier in my set of questions?
Daniel L. Comas : Jeff, in addition to that some potential commodity headwinds next year and again, that would primarily be around motion and tools for us. We, like a lot of companies, have done things around wages this year whether its’ furloughs, wage freezes, decreases, by in large lower bonuses. We are in the process of looking through a lot of that as we go through budgets. Some of it will depend upon how the overall environment is and we’ll talk more about this in December but there will be some headwinds for those types of items.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : We’ll have some restructuring investment type activity around AB Sciex given the nature of that carve out from the two parents which probably falls in that bucket.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steve Tusa – JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: I might have missed this, what was the restructuring benefit in the quarter? You said $60 million in the second half or was it in the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas : Well, it’s probably my guess $20 to $25 million from what we’ve done year-to-date plus what we did in Q4. We thought we would get $100 million this year and we’re roughly tracking $25 million a quarter so you it might be $20 from what we’ve done this year and $25 from what we’ve done last year and you see that in the sequential lift in core margins Q2 to Q3.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: On the commodity front, you talked about tools being half commodity does that include modest price benefit of tools or is that all just the cost side of the equation? Maybe you can just tell us for the company what the cost side of the equation benefited you?
Daniel L. Comas : Steve, I don’t have that outside of tools because it’s not that significant outside of tools. But, I would say sequentially commodities was more of a headwind than it was in Q2. 
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: So quarter-over-quarter?
Daniel L. Comas : Yes, quarter-over-quarter we got significant margin improvement and that was despite sort of higher commodity costs. 
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: In the Q you had an added disclosure around tax legislation that’s being debated and the last sentence said that changes here would adversely impact you guys, is there anything specific that we should be watching that would hurt you guys more than any of the other changes?
Daniel L. Comas : Nothing specific other than what some of the general discussions about raising the effective tax rate for US multinationals. 
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: One last question, just on the deal, the M&A expenses, which deals were those for, the $0.04 was for which deals?
Daniel L. Comas : It’s for deals that we have signed like AB Sciex and [Paladex] that we know we’re going to have here in the fourth quarter. There’s also a small amount of kind of onetime non-cash charges related to inventory step up and deferred revenues from deals we closed in the third quarter. 
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: So these are like smaller deals?
Daniel L. Comas : Yes.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: So going forward given these deals, you guys do a ton of small deals every year, are we going to have basically an adjusted EPS number every quarter now given that you’re going to do a few deals every quarter and you’ll be kind of like showing $0.02 to $0.03 a quarter or will this kind of be absorbed going forward as the economy improves?
Daniel L. Comas : I suspect Steve given the new accounting rules which again, particularly the expense, having to have transaction expenses run through the P&L which I don’t think is indicative of the performance of the business we’ll be calling it out.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Isn’t that though part of your ongoing business? Wouldn’t you considering doing deals given the frequency of that just basically a part of what you guys do as a company?
Daniel L. Comas : Yes and that’s very much reflected in our cash flow statement. I don’t view it as – my view and I think others have the view that is part of the cost of buying a company, the transaction costs. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ajit Pai– Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai– Thomas Weisel Partners: One main question and one follow up, the main question would be just looking at your businesses in terms of geography. Can you give us some color on how much China is a percentage of your business right now and emerging markets as a whole. Then also, looking at the three major geographies North America, Europe and Asia, where the trends are the most positive and where they are the most negative across your businesses?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, certainly Asia is the most positive when we focus on China and on India which in aggregate probably will be about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We were pleased, they were actually both up in the third quarter. We hadn’t seen that pairing in a while, they were both up about a mid single digit range. But, as we said in our prepared remarks, the rest of the fast growth or so called emerging markets were soft. We saw that in Latin America and we saw that in Eastern Europe. But, China and India were the standouts for us. The US I would say was probably number two not that we were growing but again, I think the stabilization was encouraging, the backlog build was encouraging. Of the three I would slot Europe last just given that its stabilization did not firm up as much as it did in the US but obviously a pretty big gap between what we saw in North America and in Europe compared to those two high growth countries in Asia.
Ajit Pai– Thomas Weisel Partners: The second question would be just looking at the business development environment and looking at acquisitions, in the pipeline of acquisitions you have right now is it mainly sort of add on and bolt on and maybe significant acquisitions in existing verticals that you’re in on the strategic platforms or is there some material sort of potential to get an additional platform?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think as we were talking a moment ago the funnels are always chock full of every type of opportunity from big potentially transformational situations all the way down to small channel or product bolt ons. I think as we look forward here certainly for the rest of this year, I continue to believe that it is highly unlikely that you’re going to see us create a brand new platform. Obviously with [inaudible] coming in the med tech business is going to be close to $4 billion in size, what we think of as our life science diagnostic group is going to be up 40% which is not a small number obviously. So, we’re excited about that. Obviously, lots of activity around product ID, test and measurement and environmental as well but again, I just don’t think we’ll see a new platform in the near term. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jason Feldman – UBS.
Jason Feldman – UBS: You’ve already covered quite a bit but just a few quick ones here, specifically at motion a couple of distributors in that industry have been commenting on increasing pricing pressure. Has that business been more problematic than most from a pricing perspective lately?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Not to date but I wouldn’t refute what you are hearing from distribution in that business. 
Jason Feldman – UBS: There specifically as well is kind of destocking more or less as far as it can go from your perspective or is there still some room to see some additional destocking going forward?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Those are very different questions. I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that we could see it go down further but I doubt it. Again, I think there as we lead in some other businesses I think folks are pretty close or at the level that they’re comfortable with. We might argue that maybe they’re a little light. But, at this point I think the destocking absent another external shock to the system is probably by and large run its course though again, we’re going to see a little of that for us at least still play out around certain demo lines and to a degree in tools. But otherwise, particularly in motion I think we’re pretty close.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Larry, in the past you’ve talked about certain pieces of your business being kind of internal maybe leading indicators. I think the motion business fell in there, product ID, if you were to take a snapshot of that at the end of September, just characterize where we are. It sounds like we’re maybe a little past stabilization in the US and maybe not quite there in Europe? How would you characterize those businesses that you look at as being leading indicators?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well clearly Rick we look at a lot of data points both in our own order books and the sell out and build schedules with our own customers. It’s hard to circle a data on the calendar but I think we’re clearly at a point where the US is quite firm whether you look at the book to bill at T&M, sell through at Fluke, just again this inventory issue assumingly having run its course, what we’re seeing say with the consumables at Hach Lange and Videojet as well, just a lot of different data points would suggest the worst is over and we’ll build off of this phase.  I think you’re spot on, Europe is just not there yet and [inaudible] as clear of a way as we see it here in the US. But, I don’t want to suggest that Europe is in a bad place I think it just feels, if you will, it feels like it’s behind a bit what we’re seeing in the US right now. Again, I think the real contrast is everything kicking in, in our types of businesses at least right now in China and in India. 
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Then just the last question, Larry on the dental equipment side and again maybe I’m weighting this incorrectly but certainly dental equipment being down 20% plus I think would seem worse than the industry. We have an easier fourth quarter comparison, I think last year dental equipment was down low double digits, how do you expect that business to perform? And, am I correct or incorrect saying at least in that piece of the business it feels like you’re underperforming the industry a bit?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Rick, I think we made no bones about the fact that KaVo is short of its full potential. I’ve said that externally, I’ve said that internally. But, I also want to reiterate my confidence for us to achieve that full potential in the business. I think sequentially as we indicated in our prepared remarks we would anticipate much better performance at the top certainly on the bottom as well. We have dedicated a fair bit of restructuring monies that we’ve spent this year to adjusting the cost structure particularly in Europe and elsewhere around the world.  But again, I think this is also a good growth market over the long term. We’re in a bit of an air pocket if you will right now. I think others see that as dentist postpone upgrading operatories, upgrading their practices but I think that will past, I really do and as the market recovers and we improve we should be undue beneficiaries of that. That’s the objective, that’s what we and the team have agreed to but again, work to do and we’re not there today but we’ll be working hard to be there in the not too distant future.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: I just have one quick question and again, I just want to come back to Tektronix. Can you give us a sense of the book to bill where you’re at now, kind of where you’ve been tracking through the years to get a sense of when the comps get easier next year?
Daniel L. Comas : Well the book to bill through the second quarter was running below one. Instruments and tech communications were both over one in combined but 1.1 so obviously an encouraging sign there. That will be a slight benefit in Q4 as the book to bill grows it should help going in to 2010.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: What’s the typical lag when you see an order and when you make a delivery?
Daniel L. Comas : It’s all over the map. When they were a public company they would talk about two to three quarters when the book to bill would flip, one way or another would be two to three quarters before you see that really play out in shipments.
Operator:  Mr. McGrew I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt R. McGrew : Just as a reminder the replay number is 888-203-1112 in the US and 719-457-0820 internationally with confirmation code of 8728742. Dan and I will be around all day for follow up calls. Thanks everybody.

H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : As some of you know, Matt McGrew is our newly appointed Vice President of Investor Relations and has been in the role for a couple of months now. Matt has been with Danaher since 2004 and has been an outstanding partner within both internal audit and M&A, most recently serving as our director of M&A finance. I think Matt is a great addition to the IR team and we’re happy to have him in this role. Let me start by providing some color around what we are seeing across the businesses and end markets so as to provide some context to the results we delivered in the second quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Clearly, conditions remain challenging, geographically Europe decelerated across most of our businesses in the quarter while the US and emerging economies remain soft. On a relative basis, China continues to be our best performer notwithstanding the difficult year-on-year comparisons due to sales generating in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics last summer. Despite the environment, I’m pleased with how we are executing. Results within our professional instrumentation segment were essentially in line with our overall business results as strength in our environmental platform helped to offset continued weakness in test and measurement. Our medical technologies segment absent KaVo largely outperformed as a result of its consumables mix and our med tech segment is now approaching the combined size of our industrial technologies and tools and components businesses and as a result its performance helped mitigate the larger decline seen in those two segments due to their industrial and consumer exposure. In this environment, we continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share, Sybron, Videojet, Radiometer, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Matco and ChemTreat are among the Danaher businesses where we believe we have taken notable share from competition. Our margin performance was again strong in the second quarter despite a sequential deterioration in our core growth, our decremental margins were similar to our solid first quarter performance. Additionally, I’m pleased to report that cash flow, perhaps the most significant metric for Danaher was once again robust as we generated $438 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Despite the economy we expect strong cash flow for all of 2009.  As previously announced we anticipate a total of $150 to $170 million of restructuring spending for 2009. In the second quarter we spent $46 million of these funds and eliminated approximately 1,000 positions. This amount is approximately $34 million or $0.08 per share higher than our original budgeted plan for the second quarter but consistent with our guidance provided last quarter. We believe these restructuring actions will position us well to weather the storm and to outperform when the economy improves. With that as a backdrop, let’s move to the detail of the quarter. Today we reported second quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.89 representing an 18.5% decline from last year. Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to deliver EPS within our guidance range primarily as a result of the savings generated by the restructuring actions initiated last year and taken in the first half of this year as well as the ongoing hard work of driving material costs and operating expense reductions across the company. Results for the quarter decreased 18.5% year-over-year to $2.7 billion with core revenues down 15%. The impact of currency translation reduced revenues by 5.5% offset by acquisitions which contributed 2% to sales growth. Year-to-date revenues decreased 16% to $5.3 billion as core revenues declined 13%. Year-on-year gross margin for the second quarter decreased approximately 30 basis points to 47.2%. This modest decline is primarily explained by our 2009 restructuring spending as our cost savings have largely offset the impact of the revenue decline. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 28.4% compared to 26.2% a year ago primarily due to reduced leverage on our SG&A cost base as a result of the lower sales volumes and additional restructuring costs in 2009. For the quarter, research and development spending as a percentage of sales was essentially flat year-over-year at 5.9%. Operating profit for the quarter was $344 million representing a 33% decrease over last year. Incremental restructuring spending over the prior year accounted for approximately one quarter of this decrease. For the first six months, operating profit was $684 million, a 26% decline over the same period a year ago. Operating margin in the second quarter declined 260 basis points to 12.9% primarily due to lower sales volumes across most businesses and the impact of year-over-year restructuring costs partially offset by the benefit of restructuring and cost reduction activities. Year-to-date operating margins decreased 170 basis points to 12.9% primarily as a result of these same factors.  Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 6% as compared to 24% in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by discreet tax benefits of $60 million or $0.18 per share related to the resolution of various international and domestic tax matters which we included in our guidance for the quarter. For the balance of this year, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% absent the impact of additional anticipated favorable discreet tax item. Net earnings were $296 million for the quarter, a decrease of 18.5% compared to the prior year, a result of lower revenues and additional restructuring spending offset partially by the previously mentioned tax benefit. For the first half, net earnings were $533 million, a decrease of 16.5% over last year. Operating cash flows for the second quarter were $486 million, a 16.5% decrease year-over-year. For the first six months operating cash flows were $802 million, a 12% decline over last year. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $438 million and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 148%.  DBS is the driver behind this significant and sustained cash flow performance. Our first half cash flow performance includes $900 million of cash payments as a result of our restructuring initiatives. Of particular note, we reduced inventories by over $90 million in the quarter. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will remain strong over the balance of the year and as a result we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 18th year in a row. Financially, we’re in great shape with $1.3 billion of cash on hand and over $1 billion available under our CP program. As we referenced in our prior earnings call in early April, we completed the acquisition of three companies with aggregate annual revenues of about $50 million to strengthen our environmental, test and measurement and sensors and controls businesses. We remain confident in our ability to deploy capital in this environment and are encouraged by the opportunities in our acquisitions funnels today. Now, turning to the operating segments, professional instrumentation decreased 17% for the quarter with core revenues down 15.5%. For the first half, revenues decreased 15% with core revenues down 13.5%. Operating margin for the second quarter declined 500 basis points to 15.1% primarily due to lower sales volumes and the incremental impact of year-over-year restructuring costs incurred during the quarter. Year-to-date, operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 16.4% when compared to 2008 due principally to these same factors. Environmental platform revenues declined 3.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 1%. For the first half revenues decreased 2.5% with core revenues flat. Water quality core revenues declined at a low single digit rate in the quarter as Hach Lange core revenues declined at that mid single digit level as growth in consumables and aftermarket service revenues was more than offset by soft instrumentation sales. Despite the top line performance Hach Lange’s operating margin expanded more than 50 basis points in the quarter. Trojan’s core revenues grew at a double digit rate in the quarter with strong growth in waste water applications as well as continued shipments for the New York City drinking water program. This project is expected to positively impact Trojan’s revenues for the balance of this year. During the quarter Trojan received a prestigious Stockholm Industry Water Award awarded by the Stockholm International Water Institute in recognition of several recent Trojan installations that illustrate the potential of UV treatment for waste water reuse applications. At ChemTreat revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as unseasonably cool weather in April and May briefly delayed sales to boiler cooler applications. New account generation was robust in the quarter and we believe we are capturing share in many of our vertical markets. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues were up low single digits year-over-year. At Gilbarco sales grew at a mid single digit rate, solid growth in our passport point of sale systems where we think we are taking share were partially offset by lower dispenser sales. Veeder-Root sales were down in the quarter with sales of our enhanced vapor recovery solution slowing as regulators delay enforcement actions until later this year. Moving to test and measurement, revenues declined 30.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 30% reflecting a very challenging market environment. All businesses were down significantly with the exception of Tek communications. For the first six months revenues decreased 26.5% with core revenues down 26%. Fluke core revenues declined as sales of core test products in Europe decelerated rapidly during the quarter. Inventory reductions in the distribution channel at Fluke continued to adversely impact revenues.  At Tektronix, sales were down across all product categories and geographies as customers continued to delay investments. Electronics and computer end markets were particularly soft. Sales from our Fluke Networks and Tek communications businesses collectively declined at a mid teen rate as weak demand in our enterprise management systems were partially offset by strong sales to North American carriers. Despite the weak top line performance Tektronix achieved double digit operating margins in the quarter absent restructuring costs. Moving to medical technologies, revenues for the quarter decreased 12% compared to last year with core revenues down 7.5%. For the first six months revenues decreased 9% with core revenues down 4.5%. Med tech operating margin for the second quarter was down 100 basis points to 9.8% due primarily to incremental restructuring costs incurred in the coffee. Operating margins for the first six months decreased 80 basis points to 10.3% as compared to the first six months of last year, a resulting incremental restructuring costs and lower sales volumes. Within our dental business core revenues declined at a low double digit rate in the quarter. Sybron sales declined at a low single digit rate with higher sales of our disinfection product lines more than offset by soft sales of general dentistry consumables and orthodontia products. Sales of total care disinfectant wipes used for medical applications were particularly strong in the quarter with infection control experts using them to help prevent the spread of the H1N1 swine flu virus. Despite the soft top line, we believe Sybron is capturing market share across a number of product categories. KaVo revenues declined at a high teen rate in the quarter with a general slowing across all major geographies and most product categories. The economic downturn continues to significantly impact sales of new dental equipment as many doctors postponed capital investment in their practices. A bright spot within the business has been our European demand for KaVo’s E70 treatment unit which we launched earlier this year. While we expect the third quarter to remain challenging, we are encouraged by the medium term outlook. We just completed a terrific sales meeting with a key distribution partner and are launching some important new products in the second half and we are seeing positive results from our cost reduction activities.  Leica core revenues declined in a mid single digit rate in the quarter driven by weak demand in the industrial and life science research markets. While we have seen increased quote activity, a number of customers are delaying new equipment purchases pending the release of federal stimulus funding or qualified programs. Leica Biosystems core revenues declined at a high single digit rate in the quarter as a difficult year-over-year comparison and soft instrument sales more than offset sustained growth in our advanced stain and consumables. Encouragingly new orders continue to grow at a mid single digit rate in this business. Radiometer’s core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate in the quarter driven by continued strong consumable sales primarily in Europe and Asia resulting from past success in growing our install base. China sales also benefited from the launch of the [8VL80] compact blood gas analyzer.  Moving to our industrial technologies segment, revenues declined 25.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 19%. For the first half revenues declined 22% with core revenues down 16%. Operating margin for the second quarter was 15.7%, a 140 basis point decline compared to last year due primarily to lower sales volumes as well as incremental restructuring costs incurred during the quarter. Year-to-date operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 14.7% largely due to these same factors.  Product ID revenues were down 19.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 12.5%. For the first half, product ID sales decreased 18% with core revenues down 10.5%. At Videojet, sales of consumables and aftermarket services declined at a lower rate than equipment sales in the quarter. We believe our medium and low price point CIJ printers which we launched the end of last year are continuing to take share in a tough market.  Motion revenues were down 43.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 35%. For the first half, sales declined 37.5% with core revenues down 29.5%. Further deceleration in our elevator business which was down nearly 50% and flat panel displays which is down more than 70% impacted our performance during the quarter. Additionally, customer shutdowns particularly in Germany contributed to a meaningful slowdown in our European business.  Finally, moving to tools and components, revenues for the quarter were down 23% with a core revenue decline of 22.5%. For the first half, revenues declined 22% with core revenues down 21.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 14.5%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior year due to the benefit of lower commodity costs, increased productivity, cost savings attributable to prior year initiatives as well as some favorable mix which helped offset both lower sales volumes and incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Year-to-date operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 10.6% with the difference from the three month period largely a result of legal and commodity costs recorded in the first quarter.  Mechanics hand tool core revenues declined 12% in the second quarter and 13% for the first six months primarily due to lower sales to both consumer and professional channels. We were pleased with our sell through at Sears in the quarter which was the strongest in nearly two years helped in part by good Father’s Day sales. Sales of our domestic china tool brand [Sada] also rebounded this quarter.  To wrap up my prepared remarks, as we are all aware, these are unprecedented economic times but it is during times like these that we believe we have the ability to outperform. When the economy and our end markets improve we believe we will emerge as an even stronger and more competitive company. Our expectation is for third quarter core revenues to be in line with those of the second quarter. For the full year, we are forecasting core revenues declines approximately in line with the first half of this year.  The additional restructuring charges that we announced in April are expected to reduce EPS by approximately $0.08 per share in the third quarter and $0.25 per share for the full year. We expect the reductions in our tax reserves will increase EPS by approximately $0.12 per share in the third quarter and $0.30 per share for the full year. As a result, we expect our earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. For the full year we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. These ranges include the tax and additional restructuring items just mentioned but exclude the impact of future acquisition related costs resulting from the adoption of SFAS 141R.
Matt R. McGrew : That concludes the formal comments. We’re now ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: Maybe just first of all give us a little help Larry with how the quarter tracked April, May, June, I mean was the exit rate June significantly worse than the 15% organic growth decline?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : No, I think as you look across the last three months we were pretty much in line with what we reported during the course of the quarter, no real change in that regard, certainly not a decal as we exited June. Some of the leading indicators whether it be quotations or funnels, our look at many of our distribution partners inventories, I think on balance were stabilizing and in some cases dare I say encouraging but in terms of what went out the door it was by in large linear in the quarter. 
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: When you talked about gaining market share in a bunch of these businesses, some of the heavy lifting on restructuring, do you think you’re setting Danaher up to grow faster than the 5% to 7% going forward in a comparable economic environment? Is that something that is the back of your mind at all in some of these programs?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, I think everything we do Bob in that regard both organically and frankly, inorganically is aimed at delivering core growth in that range. Obviously, we would like to think over time that we could do better. I don’t think we’re going to reframe that long term core growth rate on the call today. I’m optimistic that we will be in a different economic environment at some point but right now I think we’re well served by being tough on costs, being aggressive on share, continuing to stock the acquisition pipeline which again, we’re very optimistic about and just play our game. When the headwinds subside, let alone when the tailwinds present themselves, I think we’ll be in good shape.
Robert Cornell – Barclays Capital: One final thought Larry, is it fair to say the change in guidance is a function of the drop in Europe?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think that’s a large part of it Bob. We saw in Europe a marked decel from the first quarter. Now, we were working probably against one of our tougher comps over there but Europe got soft in almost every business during the second quarter in a way I think hopefully is not a permanent state but it was a shock to the system.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America. 
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: I guess sharp declines in test and measurements opens the door that that could rebound quite quickly. How do the book-to-bill ratios look in those businesses?
Daniel L. Comas : Unlike the first quarter, where our shipments were clearly better than our bookings, we saw more equalization of that in the second quarter. I’m not sure we’re forecasting a turn here in the second half but it was an encouraging sign.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: How does the new product launch cycle look for Tektronix sort of second half of the year and maybe in to 2010?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think the new product pipeline there Nigel is one we’re pretty encouraged by. I think that team has certainly over the last two years been more focused around where we’ve been spending that money and they obviously have a long history of being outstanding in bringing new technologies to market. I would just add to your question, another area that we’ve been working hard on in Tek is to improve the global go to market capability. It’s one thing to have great products but we need to be able to sell those effectively, present that value prop to customers around the world and I think as we anticipate that rebound that you just referred to that will come, we just don’t know when, I think from a product and go to market perspective we’ll be in much better shape when we went in to the downturn here.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: In that regard, how much of an opportunity to you think the 3G launches are in China?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, I think China is hard for us to read right now but within the comp side at Tek we are comfortable with our positioning but obviously we want to see that play out a bit more than it has thus far.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank North America: Then just one final one for me, the industrial margin strength was a bit of a surprise given the volume headwinds. Could you just sort of breakout price inflation? Maybe juts for the whole of Danaher just the price inflation gap through the quarter and in particular within tools and industrial tech?
Daniel L. Comas : Nigel, specifically on price we got about a point and a half of price across businesses and roughly in those segments. I think we were pleased the way price held up and that clearly benefitted margins in the quarter. I think particularly with motion and tools we are getting some commodity benefit right now and you saw that play out with the very good tool margin performance. I would add to that we’re executing well in the factories both in the tool and margin side and I think that’s helping as well and we’ve also got some commodity relief really start to play out here in the second quarter in those two businesses.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steve Tusa – JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: It’s tough to tell what the dynamics are on the margin in professional instrumentation but, where do the margins in Tektronix stand? I guess if you could just talk about that versus just the margin dynamics between that and Fluke in the quarter?
Daniel L. Comas : Tektronixs all up absent the restructuring was about 10% operating margin. Fluke remained north of 20%.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Then just looking at the back half of the year, any change in your foreign exchange assumptions?
Daniel L. Comas : Basically based on where it was, right now about 1.40 which is pretty close to where it was in April.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: I’d like to pick up on your comment to Bob’s earlier question regarding M&A and you said that you’re optimistic so just give us the latest update in terms of pipeline, asking prices for assets and more specifically about how much acquisition capital you think you’re willing to commit at this stage?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Dean, I think again we certainly are very busy right now on the M&A front. I think we’re pleased with the progress that we’re making both around frankly the active deals as well as in our monthly funnel reviews with all the businesses. I think as we’ve said during the course of the year time is our friend here as the 52 week highs come down with the [inaudible] and the economy just wears on many private owners. So, I think as we look at the balance sheet, clearly with the cash on hand and we mentioned the CP availability as well, I think we’re very comfortable with the prospect of deplying9 billions of dollars in this environment. Again, I think we’re going to try and be as smart as we can both strategically and financially as we deploy that capital but we have a lot of conviction that these are the types of times in which we want to be an aggressive strategic investor in our businesses. Obviously, not a lot necessarily through the first six months to show in that regard but again, I think this is going to be a good year for us as the environment only gets better.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: Should we expect a larger deal or a number of smaller bolt ons? You’re probably not willing to give more clarity on the billions but can you narrow that down at all?
Daniel L. Comas : Deane, one way to frame that up is we have roughly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. If we have comparable cash flow in the second half as the first half that’d be another $725,000 and as Larry mentioned we have $1 billion of availability on our commercial paper program. So, that could kind of frame up our kind of latitude if you will over the next two or three quarters from a capital structure point of view.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Deane, we never plan it this way but obviously if you look at every dozen or 15 deals that we do, obviously the majority of those tend to be important bolt ons with one, or two, or three larger transactions that are also consistent with the strategy. So as we try to [inaudible] you with a little bit of color, looking forward I don’t think that the future will be much different than that past performance.
Deane Dray – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., LLC.: Just a follow up for Dan, at EPG you all were quite explicit to say that you were managing more to a decremental margin at this stage of the downturn and 25 was the bogey and it looks like you slipped a little bit above that. How precise can that be managed and what are your expectations going forward?
Daniel L. Comas : Well Deane on the second quarter if you exclude the incremental restructuring our decrementals are actually about 23% which were a little better than what we did in the first quarter. Clearly, if you add the incremental restructuring we were slightly north of 25%. So, we were very pleased with our decremental margin performance here in Q2 resulting from a couple of things: one, the actions we’ve taken on the restructuring side; two, the fact that we still are getting some price; and finally, we are getting some commodity relief here. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague – Citigroup.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Just on the Tek versus Fluke it appears that the margins in Tek are coming down much more sharply than they are in Fluke. A, is that correct statement or is that just a function of where you’re at in the integration?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think it’s a function of a couple of things Jeff, one is the Tek’s down a little bit more of Fluke, the gross margins are a little higher at Tek so that top line dynamic creates a little bit more downward pressure and the third bit would be just what you described, we obviously are much further along at Fluke than we are at Tek. One business we’ve had for a decade, the other for a couple of years now. With that said, I think as we move through the second half of this year, I think we’d anticipate showing some sequential improvement in the margins at Tek. I think they’re doing a very good job on the cost side and as Nigel alluded to earlier, when the volumes come back I think we’re really going to like the performance out of that business.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: The favorable price cost that you saw in the quarter, I guess particularly for tools but also in the motion and some of the other industrial businesses, do you have that magnitude of the benefit in the third quarter or does it start to diminish from here? How do we think about that?
Daniel L. Comas : Well you’ve seen some rise in commodity prices so it may not be quite as much. We’ve been told if everything works well in the second quarter, our execution, price, commodity, we also had some favorable mix, within in tool I wouldn’t expect quite as much of a year-on-year improvement. That’s probably more related to mix and maybe a little less commodity benefit.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Is there any favorable LIFO dynamics going on in the margins currently?
Daniel L. Comas : Well, I think we kind of bleed through the high commodity costs even though commodities came down the end of last year it actually took getting through the last quarter to really see the benefit and it really rolled in to the second quarter.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Then just finally for me, on Trojan a nice bright spot, how long does that project play out over the next several quarters? And, anything else going on in the bid and proposals side of that business?
Daniel L. Comas : Regarding New York City we will recognize most of that revenue this year and we’ll have a strong second half, both quarters, regarding Trojan.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Jeff, we haven’t really seen a dramatic tail off in the big quote activity there which is encouraging. I think that’s where the Stockholm Award is particularly important because with everything going on in places like Australia and California the whole idea of this waste water reuse is getting more attention and I think Trojan is very well positioned in that regard.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Are there any stimulus that’s actually pointed towards Trojan in some direct or indirect way?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think our view is that both Trojan and Hach Lange will get some of this targeted water quality money. It’s just this stuff is far from shovel ready as they say so it’s probably more of a dynamic for next year and maybe even more so in ’11 than anything we might dial in here for the second half. I mean in contrast whether you’re talking about the US stimulus or maybe even what the Chinese and Japanese are trying to do, we would anticipate maybe seeing a little bit more of that show up in med tech particularly in Leica on the research side a little sooner. But quite frankly Jeff, we don’t have a lot of that dialed in here to the second half. Obviously, Fluke’s got some exposure both around weatherization and the so called smart grid but again, it’s on the margins my in large and we’re not going – what we’ve presented here is not a fourth quarter waiting for a handout.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Baliotti – FTN Midwest.
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest: Larry or Dan or I guess maybe collectively obviously the balance sheet is very strong and you guys have had a very long history of deep due diligence even on small deals so I’m just wondering, we’ve seen some headlines on some macro data that makes people think things are getting better. Some companies are saying it’s less negative or things are stabilizing. Is that manifesting itself in any of the targets?  Do they have the impression of hey they made it this far so maybe they’re not looking for the kind of valuations that they may have been considering earlier in the year? Given that your restructuring is going up, it would appear that you guys are certainly not expecting things to just come right out of this any time soon. I’m just wondering are the targets less realistic than you are?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, some may be listening in so I don’t want in any way to –
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest: Okay, how about academically?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Academically, of course. John, I think everyone is mindful of the environment. Obviously, what we do is driven by a long term perspective on what’s best for Danaher. I think the general stabilization that we’re seeing perhaps in a number of markets at least here in the US is helpful, it’s constructive because in certain situations it’s been tough to talk about the numbers, to forecast the model with things moving around the way they have the last six to nine months. So, I think in a number of situations where people have perhaps decided to have conversation with us or others, the current environment is actually again constructive because we can talk to a set of numbers that have perhaps less variability and risk in them then they might have three or six months ago.
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest: It’s obviously not just you guys because there are a number of companies that have a history of consistent M&A and they’re pretty quite also and they’re also very conservative and also very thorough and it just seemed consistent that no one seems to be doing very much right now and the equity market running in spurts it seems like some people are thinking that we’re just going to come right out of this and spending is going to resume the way it was going in to it.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I would encourage you not to too tightly link the absence of any announcement with the level of work that’s being done.
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest: Oh no, I would expect it to be just as much if not more but it seems like there’s obviously no panic on anyone’s part given what’s going on out there. Is that fair to say?
Daniel L. Comas : John, I’d add a couple of things maybe along the lines of what Larry referenced, the improvement in the equity markets here the last couple of months actually has helped a few discussions. There’s a little bit less of a mindset from sellers that they’re selling at the absolute kind of bottom and actually that plays in to price discussions. I would also add that the expectation among sellers of a very quick recovery, I would say has significantly dissipated versus our discussion four or five months ago. As we talk about forecasts with potential sellers you are seeing a lot fewer kind of V shaped recoveries or if you do, as you really drill down with them, they realize that’s kind of optimistic. I think just the economic climate, the fact that it’s been now out there for three quarters does weigh on sellers particularly around how good things could look or perhaps things may not turn that quickly when they do turn and that again, helps in terms of the price discussion.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: A couple of questions, one on restructuring you had talked about the $150 to $170 million targeted for ’09 charges that would lead to ’09 savings of about $150 and annualized to about $250. You’ve talked a lot about that this call but could you give a little more color on sort of how we should think about that quantitatively in terms of your progress against the savings side of that?
Daniel L. Comas : What we reference was the $150 to $170 would generate about $50 million of savings in the back half year and about another $90 million next year, about $140 million in total. I think what you’re referencing, the $250 million in total of savings includes what we did in the fourth quarter of last year. So roughly the $250 of spend will get an annualized savings of $250. In terms of the pay back we’re seeing, we’re pretty comfortable and we see it kind of playing out in the decremental margins that we’re getting a kind of one year pay back on what we’ve done so far and we’ve seen that play out pretty favorably here in the first half. As you know, we’re pretty high gross margin, high contribution margin business and our ability to sort of keep the decrementals down to sort of 25% has been the result of what we have done. So, at least what we’ve executed so far, the pay back has played out as we expected.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Why not increase the restructuring at this point in terms of the forward commitment? Is it a function of we feel like we have our hands full already, just trying to balance capital allocation? How should we think about increases in the actual charges?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well Steve obviously as Dan’s walk just suggested, we did that not too long ago. I think virtually every one of our businesses is pretty busy in that regard. But, you’ve raised a good question and I wouldn’t want to discount the possibilities as we get a little further down the road this year as we see those types of projects present themselves, if we continue to make the progress, executing the approved programs, we may come back and do just that. 
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: On working capital, I think I looked at inventory sort of a couple of days better than prior quarter, a couple of days worse than prior year, receivables a little bit longer by a few days, payables about in line, not dramatic changes, as you look at that in the current environment, what kind of dynamics are you seeing going forward?
Daniel L. Comas : Overall, we were very pleased, particularly if you look at the end of the first quarter and what we did in the second quarter, taking out about $90 million of inventory out of the system. That’s clearly a little bit of a negative to the net income line as we kind of put less overhead in to inventory but clearly the right thing to be doing from a cash flow perspective and managing the business appropriate with the top line picture. I mean overall I would say Steve we’re pretty pleased with what we have done in the working capital side here in the first half particular in the second quarter.
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: In terms of the receivable side, customer liquidity are you seeing less pressure on your customers as well?
Daniel L. Comas : Steve, on the margin it’s probably gotten a little bit better, it’s still a little bit more of a challenge in the emerging economy as you’d expect and that’s where we’re seeing challenges, it tends to be in those economies. 
Steven Winoker – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.:  I guess my final question in light of all the acquisition discussion, you’ve talked about Tek versus Fluke a little bit and given the core growth down over so dramatically how are you thinking about what’s evidence of integration success here? So, as we think about it should another major acquisition come along we can or not point to Tek as an example of Danaher’s successful DBS implementation?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Well, I just think that if you look at the margin performance both on an absolutely and a decremental basis, in light of the economy, to me the performance stacks up pretty well. I also think if you look at what we’re turning in here relative to competition, we fair pretty well. Some of the things are a little harder Steve to give you visibility on that I look at relative to the teams’ embrace of DBS in the lab. On the sales and marketing side what they’re doing relative to what will move the share needle if not the overall top line going forward.  I think this is has been a very well executed integration. I give that team out in Beaverton very high marks in that regard. Has it been perfect? No but an excellent effort in many ways. Again, I think as some folks mentioned earlier, we simply need a little bit of tailwind in that market place for this business to be a very strong contributor to the overall Danaher performance.
Daniel L. Comas : Steve, just one data point, as you know when we acquired the business it was about a 12% operating profit business. This quarter top line was down over 30% and we still achieved 10% operating margins. For a 60% gross margin business you can imagine the fall off when you lose 30% of revenues. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs. 
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: I got on the call a little bit late so I may have missed this but I’m wondering if you can talk about expectations for second half free cash conversion? It won’t be as strong as this quarter which was much better than we thought but it’s still pretty [soft].
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : We thought that while we’re proud of the second quarter and at such a high bar at a minimum we thought we’d have strong conversion in the second half and certainly thought the full year would be north of 100% Terry.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Then Larry can you talk about maybe the two swing factors that might push you to the high end of the range for the back half guidance and the two or three swing factors to the low end?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think given what happened in Europe in the second quarter that’s probably on both lists Terry to be frank. I think one of the swings to the upside could well be inventory levels in the channel. We’ve seen such a dramatic drop even in the face of sell through being down but relatively stable. Depending on how folks maybe come back from labor day and are looking at their inventory levels we could see a little bit more pop in the top line than frankly what we’ve dialed in. I think we’ve got a generally conservative top line outlook for the second half just given the environment. But, that’s where I would look to see a little bit of potential upside. In terms of the downside, I think Europe is the geography that we have our eyes on right now.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Then lastly, buyback is that on the radar screen at all or are you just that optimistic about acquisitions that you want to remain in position for that?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think right now given what’s in the pipe we’re going to be very focused on the M&A front.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Richard C. Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.
Richard C. Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Larry just a couple of things from a geographic perspective. One is, could you just lay out maybe the second half as it applies to China in terms of your expectations? I mean, can we see some growth there year-over-year in the second half?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : I think we’ll see an improving situation in China. We’ve seen a lot of projects get pushed interestingly at a time when the government is trying to stimulate the economy. But, I think we’ve got an eye on returning to growth perhaps more so in the fourth and for the full second half.
Richard C. Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Would it be fair to say that any follow on restructuring program or additional incremental restructuring program in the second half again would be perhaps targeted more towards the European assets given where sales trends are? Are you comfortable that you’ve scoped out enough cost savings given the relative decline in volumes out of Europe?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. : Rick, I think that’s a very fair assumption but I wouldn’t limit it to Europe largely because as we tend to transform these cost structures in our best businesses and some of our businesses with the most improvement opportunity, regardless of where they are located, one improvement sets you up to go get the next one. So, there are things that we’re working on now even in the US that may well set us up to access that next level of costs coming out. But, you’re point about Europe I think is very relevant at least in our business and I suspect others.
Operator:  That does conclude our question and answer session. We will now turn the conference over to Mr. Matt McGrew for any closing or additional remarks.
Matt R. McGrew : Just as reminder the replay number is 888-203-1112 in the US and 719-457-0820 internationally with the confirmation code of 7112404. Dan and I will be available today for any follow up calls. Thanks everyone for joining us.
Operator:  That does conclude our conference call. Thank you for your participation.

So with that I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Andy, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start this morning by providing some color around what we're seeing across our businesses and end markets so that to provide some context to the results we delivered in the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. We are clearly operating in a difficult economic environment. Geographically, both the U.S. and Western Europe are extremely soft. And most of the emerging economies have also experienced significant declines. For us, the exception was China where our business was down, but only modestly in the first quarter. On the positive side, most of our Medtech businesses, which we did not own during the last economic downturn had solid performances in the quarter. In addition, both our Water Quality and our consumables businesses are holding up pretty well. Finally, despite an overall softer top line we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter while continuing to invest for the future. Our motion, test and measurement and cable businesses have been the most significantly impacted by the global downturn. But none of these businesses have been immune. On the whole, discretionary corporate and consumer spending remains weak, particularly at higher price points or commitment levels. So we're obviously in a share gain game right now. And we are accelerating our cost reduction actions. In addition to the 2008 cost reduction efforts and the $50 million of ongoing restructuring activities built in to our 2009 plan, the economic outlook has us digging deeper. Accordingly, we have begun taking $100 million to $120 million of additional restructuring actions throughout the Company. In total, these initiatives are expected to generate annualized savings of approximately $140 million. I'm pleased to report that cash flow, the hallmark of Danaher was once again robust as we generated over $280 million of free cash flow in the quarter, down only slightly versus the same period a year ago. Despite the economy, we expect strong cash flow for all of 2009. Financially, we are in terrific shape with more than $900 million of cash on hand and over $1 million of availability under our CP program. During the quarter, we completed a 10-year $750 million bond issuance. The proceeds of which will help ensure we are well positioned to be active on the acquisition front. While we are not expecting a near-term improvement in current economic conditions, we do believe that our solid portfolio of businesses rooted in the Danaher Business System, which is the backbone of our operating model and the foundation of our culture, coupled with our seasoned leadership team will allow us to out execute our competition and as a result take share in the markets we serve. So with that as backdrop, I'd like to move now to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.72, representing a 13% decline from last year. Earnings per diluted share declined 19% as compared to last year on an adjusted EPS basis. Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to deliver EPS within our guidance range, primarily due to the savings generated by the restructuring actions initiated last year as well as the ongoing hard work of driving material cost and operating expense reductions across the Company in the first quarter. Revenues for the quarter decreased roughly 13% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, with core revenues down 10%. The impact of currency reduced revenues by 5.5% offset by acquisitions which contributed 2.5% to sales growth. Revenues also benefited from four extra days in the first quarter. The corresponding offset of days will be realized in the second and fourth quarters of this year. Year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter increased approximately 110 basis points to 47.9%. Excluding the impact of prior year Tektronix charges, gross margins were up slightly despite the revenue decline. This was primarily due to the impact of recent restructuring activities and lower raw material costs. SG&A expenses decreased 7.5%, but as a percent of sales were 28.8% compared to 27% last year primarily due to reduced leverage on our SG&A cost base as a result of the lower sales volumes. For the quarter, Research and Development spending as a percentage of sales was essentially flat year-over-year at 6.1%. Operating profit for the quarter was $340 million, representing a 17.5% decrease over last year. Operating margin in the first quarter was 12.9%, a 70 basis point decline from 2008, core operating margin in the first quarter was down 130 basis points compared to the prior year period due to lower revenues across most businesses and partially offset by the benefit of recent restructuring and other cost reduction actions. Despite the tough top line environment, we continued to make significant progress on the cost front across Danaher. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 25% as compared to 26.5% in the prior year period. For the balance of the year we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% absent the impact of anticipated favorable discrete tax items. Net earnings were $238 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year, a result of softer revenues and the negative impact of currency translations. Operating cash flows were $317 million in the quarter, a 5% decline year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $280 million and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 118%. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will remain strong over the balance of this year and as a result we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income what would be our 18th year in a row. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of three companies, comprising about $50 million of annualized revenue to strengthen our environmental, test and measurement and sensors and controls businesses. We believe the acquisition environment is becoming more attractive and that we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities. Now turning to the operating segments, professional instrumentation revenues decreased 12.5% for the quarter with core revenues down 11.5%. Operating margin for the first quarter was up 120 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting the prior year impact of inventory and deferred revenue charges related to the acquisition of Tektronix. Core operating margin declined 45 basis points in the quarter, a significant restructuring and cost reduction activities helped to offset core revenue declines. Environmental platform revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 1%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. At Hach Lange, core revenues were essentially flat and solid growth in consumables and aftermarket service helped offset soft instrumentation sales. Despite the flat top line performance, Hach Lange's operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points in the quarter. Trojan's core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter as we continued to see solid demand from China for our waste water and drinking water UV disinfection products. During the quarter we began shipping product to New York City drinking water project which should positively impact Trojan's revenues for the balance of the year. Trojan exited the quarter with a robust backlog of more than $85 million. At ChemTreat, revenues were up at a mid single digit rate as ChemTreat share gains across multiple vertical markets continued. Gilbarco Veeder Root core revenues were essentially flat year-over-year, a strong performance given the economy and a difficult prior year comparison due to a large tender in India. Veeder Root grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to strong sales of its enhanced vapor recovery solution. Gilbarco enjoyed solid growth in our passport point-of-sale system where we continued to take market share. But that was offset by lower dispenser sales. Of note, in March we recognized a significant achievement when we installed our 5,000th passport PoS system. Subsequent to quarter end, Gilbarco Veeder Root completed the acquisition of Postec, a New Zealand based provider of automation solutions and outdoor payment systems used primarily in emerging markets. Moving to test and measurement, revenues declined 23% in the quarter, with core revenues down 22%. Fluke and Tektronix both declined by approximately the same amount. At Fluke, lower overall demand for our core test products and inventory reductions in distribution drove the majority of the decline. At Tektronix, we experienced lower sales across all product categories and geographies as customers continued to delay investments. Electronics and computer end markets were particularly soft. The team has accelerated further cost reduction efforts to help offset this broad based market decline. The bright spot in test and measurement was Tech Communications, our network management business which continues to perform well as telecom system providers rely heavily on our technology to keep their fixed and mobile networks running smoothly. We have seen especially strong adoption of our test and optimization solutions in the mobile space. Subsequent to quarter-end, Tech Communications completed the acquisition of Aaron technologies, a Dublin based supplier of customer experienced management solutions for wireless carriers, enabling those carriers to provide high quality, uninterrupted service to their customers. Moving to Medtech, revenues for the quarter decreased 5.5% compared to last year, with core revenues down modestly 1.5%. The addition of this segment to our portfolio since the last recession has clearly helped protect our top line during these difficult economic times. Medtech operating margin for the first quarter was down 70 basis points to 10.8%. Absent acquisition impact and restructuring activities in the quarter, year-on-year operating margin was relatively flat. Within our dental business, core revenues declined in a mid single digit rate in the quarter. Sybron grew at a low single digit rate, led by higher sales of our SybronEndo twisted files and Total Care's disinfection products. We also saw some modest sequential and year-over-year improvement at Ormco. KaVo revenues declined at a low teens rate in the quarter as expected with a general slowing across all major geographies and product categories. The economic downturn continues to significantly impact sales of new dental equipment as many doctors are postponing capital investments in their practices. Leica core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter, driven primarily by sustained demand in life science, research markets as well as low double-digit growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostics and consumables business. Industrial market demand slowed in the quarter. Clinical demand also softened due to reduced capital spending budgets and customer delays as hospitals attempt to better understand potential stimulus plan benefits. Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate for the quarter driven by continued strong consumable sales primarily in Europe and Asia resulting from past success in growing our installed base. Moving to industrial technologies, revenues declined 18.5% for the quarter, with core revenues down 12%. Operating margin for the first quarter was 13.7%, a 110 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower sales volumes across the segment. Product ID revenues were down 16% in the quarter with core revenues declining 8%. An increase in our service business and a modest decline in consumables was more than offset by weak demand for new equipment at Videojet. Despite the top line being soft, Videojet's operating margin expanded by more than 100 basis points in the quarter. Our medium and low price point continuous inkjet printers which we launched late in 2008 are continuing to capture market share as we have now placed more than 1,000 printers with our customers in the quarter. Motion revenues were down 31% in the quarter with core revenues down 23.5%. While we expect the Motion to be impacted as a result of the industrial downturn, we did not foresee a decline of this magnitude. Our elevator business was down more than 30% in the quarter, and flat panel display revenues were down more than 50%. We expect this softness to continue and as a result we are deploying significant cost reduction efforts here. Post quarter's end we completed the acquisition of Diagnostic Monitoring Systems in the industrial technology segment, headquartered in Glasgow, Scotland. DMS is the leading management actuary of diagnostics smart grid technology used by electric utilities to better manage and monitor their large grid based assets. Finally, moving to tools and components, revenues for the quarter decreased 21% with core revenues down 20.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%, a decline of approximately 510 basis points from the prior year, largely due to lower sales volumes, particularly in our higher margin Matco and Hennessy businesses. The impact of litigation settlements also negatively impacted operating margin. Absent planned restructuring charges, we anticipate operating margin improvement in tools sequentially as we move through the year. Mechanics hand tool core revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and professional channels. Sales of our domestic China tool brand were also soft although we saw sequential improvements through the quarter. In March, we were awarded a new multi million dollar contract from the U.S. Marine Corps to supply tool kits which we will begin shipping in the second quarter of this year. So to wrap up my prepared remarks, we are all aware these are unprecedented economic times. But it is during times like these that we believe we have the ability to outperform. And when the economy and our end markets improve, we do believe we will emerge an even stronger and more competitive Company. As I mentioned earlier, given the environment, we are accelerating our cost reduction and restructuring activities, which now total $150 million to $170 million this year. These initiatives will result in the elimination of 2,300 positions and 16 facilities and provide annual cost savings of approximately $140 million. This is in addition to the more than $100 million of savings we discussed with you during our year-end call. In addition, we anticipate a reduction in our tax reserves of approximately $100 million resulting from the favorable settlement and our statute expirations of certain international and domestic return years. Our expectation is for the second quarter core revenues to be slightly worse than the first. And for the full year, we are forecasting core revenue declines approximately in line with our first quarter decline of 10%. The $100 million to $120 million of additional restructuring charges are expected to reduce EPS by approximately $0.08 per share in the second quarter and $0.25 per share for the full year. We expect the reductions in our tax reserves will increase EPS by approximately $0.18 per share in the second quarter and $0.30 per share for the full year. As a result, our earnings per share guidance for the second quarter will be in the range of $0.85 to $0.95. For the full year, our earnings per share guidance will be in the range of $3.30 to $3.70. These ranges include the tax and additional restructuring items just mentioned.
Andy Wilson: Thank you, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). And our first question today comes from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: Yes, thanks. Couple of things. One is, in the volume declines, you didn't mention anything about destocking. I know it's hard to measure it, but maybe give us an idea of what you see there.
Larry Culp: Bob, good morning. We certainly saw I think both our channel partners where we go to market through distribution and a number of our OEM customers take stock down during the course of the quarter. I think given some of the uncertainties out there, I don't think we would declare that today that, that resetting, that destocking that has been going on is finished. I suspect we're still going to see the effect of that in our order books and in our shipments during the course of the second quarter and perhaps some of that will play out in the second half. But it certainly had an effect. It's hard to say when that will conclude but we saw that in many businesses to be sure.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: You didn't make a specific comment on the impact of price on the volume in the quarter. Maybe you could comment there. And are you guys seeing an increase or decrease in price competition and how are you on the whole price cost issue?
Larry Culp: Well, I think with respect to price, we had positive price in the first quarter about a 0.5, a little less than we saw obviously in the fourth quarter and during the course of last year. So, it's clear in many markets given the volume declines that competition is heating up. But I think by and large, there are lots of ways to manage price, like the work that we're doing. But as we look forward, certainly mindful that, that competitive pressure will remain, if not heightened, we would expect that the price will be a lesser positive impact for us, but a positive impact for us as we go through the year. With respect to cost, obviously a lot of prepared commentary, maybe some additional follow-on questions relative to the additional restructuring. But the other cost activities whether it's around procurement, commodities, other things that we buy and the like, I like where we are. I think you see that play out both in the core margin performance, down 130 BPs on 10% revenue declines, I think is indicative of that progress as is the cash flow performance.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: One final question from me, Larry. I think you said just now the organic growth you saw in the second quarter will be worse than the first, but the year will end up at 10, can you just flesh out that thought, please?
Larry Culp: Sure. Well, I think given that – given the way the year has started and given what we see here in the near-term, I think the idea that we're going to not benefit as we did perhaps from a couple of extra days in the quarter and a number of our businesses still wrestling with tough demand conditions leads us to offer up that guidance today relative to the sequential decline or the increased decline. But for the full year, Bob, I think as we wrestle the second quarter, we know we have a couple of offsets there. It is our toughest comp given we were up 5% a year ago. Obviously, that's less of an issue for us in the second half. We get to the fourth quarter where we have I think the easiest comp that we will work against. So that's what we think we'll wrestle with in the second quarter. I think that's the way the second half will play out at this point. So net it all out for the year, we think we'll be in and around that core performance that we registered in the first quarter.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thanks, Larry. Lots of really questions, but I'll let other people ask them. Danny, I thought –
Dan Comas: I was just saying, with the guidance of the full year being down in line with the first quarter, we're basically not sort of expecting any sort of recovery here in the second half. Very difficult to call. I mean, I think if we do get some stabilization in the second half, we obviously would do better than the numbers we just talked about.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: Lots of questions but I'll let other people ask them. Thank you.
Dan Comas: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: Yes. Thanks. Good morning.
Larry Culp: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: Just wanted to pick up that thought from Bob. We don't know how much inventories impacted the first quarter performance but let's assume they did. So – and basically flat lining the organic growth of full year, assuming some benefit from comps in 4Q. You're not really assuming any moderation of inventory declines or are you seeing some of the stronger performances, such as Leica and Radiometer will start to turn.
Larry Culp: Well, I think again, it is hard to call the inventory resets but we have to be closer to the end of those than not given what we saw play out in a number of our businesses. Many of which go to market in part or largely through distribution. So I don't think that we would claim to have a clear crystal ball at this point, Nigel, but I do think that moderates for us during the course of the year, particularly so in the second half.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Obviously it's difficult to forecast in this environment, but can you just give us a bit more color on how the quarter trend in terms of core growth and maybe on some of that throw in some book-to-bill ratios?
Dan Comas: Overall, Nigel, in terms of bookings, it was pretty linear during the quarter, not much of a change. In terms of shipments, January was a little bit better just because we had a little bit of backlog. As you know, we're primarily a book and ship business but we do carry some backlog here and that benefited us in January. In terms of overall orders, it's been pretty steady.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then just one more from me. The tax rate of 25%, I think Larry called out some discrete items in that number, but the $100 million you talk about in the 10-Q, that's not within the 25%.
Dan Comas: That is correct. The 25% is our expected ongoing provision. The $100 million is a discrete item that we expect to book this year.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Larry Culp: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jeff Sprague of Citi Investment Research.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: Thanks. Good morning. Just put a finer point on the sales comps. The four extra days, do you think about that as on a calendar basis or kind of work selling day basis, just want to understand if we're kind of calling kind of really the core of Q1 down, what 14% or 15%?
Larry Culp: Jeff, I don't think it would be that much. I mean, it's very hard to tell in a number of our businesses, I think, just how much impact we would have had. But it's probably couple hundred basis points in that range, which is part of I think what we're suggesting here that will continue, not worsen as we look at the second quarter.
Dan Comas: I think for – two-thirds of our business being kind of equipment and instrumentation, days tend to have less of an impact. We also had January we had so many customers just shut down. So it is I think harder in this environment to sort of kind of quantify the impact. I think with our consumables, roughly a third of the portfolio that's where we probably saw some impact, Jeff, from the extra days.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: And there was a couple consumables comments laid through your prepared remarks there. And it sounds like except maybe for Videojet they were up across the board but could you give us a little more color on is there any inventory destocking or anything going on as it relates to consumables also that kind of colors your view?
Larry Culp: Well, I think, Jeff, you got a pretty good feed there. You look at Medtech where we had I think good performance, particularly with consumables, principally at Radiometer and at Sybron to a lesser degree at Leica. I think we did see – those are largely direct businesses. We did see I think hospitals or even specialty dental professionals reducing what they got in their stock rooms and their closets. But nonetheless, I think we enjoyed good performance there. In environmental, instrument sales were soft as you would expect. People were still running plants, still complying with clean water rules. That was a pretty steady business for us and even at product ID where we saw plant shutdowns as Dan just alluded to and I think some destocking in inventories just as the year got off to a sluggish start, that held in pretty well, again despite some of the capital equipment purchases being pushed out a bit. So I think where we have that consumable exposure, that 1/3 that we referenced very good performance.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: And just finally from me, I know there's a lot of macro questions but to drill on to something micro here, this small deal in Motion that you said plays into the grid in smart grid, where are you going with that and are we opening the door maybe to a new sub-platform here?
Larry Culp: We'll walk before we run there, Jeff. What we're really doing is adding some additional remote diagnostic and monitoring capability to our Qualitrol business. One of our really nice niche instrumentation businesses inside of sensors and controls. They got an excellent worldwide position with the electrical utilities, particularly around transformer instrumentation and this gives them a nice additional play, obviously, if the smart grid initiatives play out.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: Thank you.
Larry Culp: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Larry Culp: Hey, Steve.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Just on the, getting back to the price cost, you said that the raw material costs were actually down in the quarter. I think you got about a point, point half of price. Can you just maybe talk about how you see that playing out for the rest of the year, maybe how much of a benefit was it to the margin this quarter?
Dan Comas: Well, Steve, you saw that over – if you factor out some of the Tektronix noise from a year ago, overall gross margins were flat which was pretty impressive performance given the top line. I think that's a reflection of both getting some price, the commodity reductions and particularly our Q4 restructuring benefit. As Larry indicated, we think price will be positive, but it will – I think it will decline somewhat during the course of the year, but both because of the restructuring and the commodities, we should do pretty well on the gross margin line throughout the year. But I can't quantify more than that.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Dan, and then free cash flow, there were some relatively big swings in receivables and payables. Is anything going on there?
Dan Comas: Primarily I would say it's just a reflection of the lower core growth. I think I've also noted we funded about $50 million of restructuring in the quarter that was part of Q4 expense but actually got funded in the first quarter. So actually year on year absent restructuring, our free cash flow would have been up.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Okay. And then one more just on Tektronix. How is the business from a profitability's perspective running relative to where you ended the year last year?
Dan Comas: We were slightly north of 15% in the first quarter, which was down from the high teens we were running in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the volume, we had terrific margin performance in the quarter, but clearly getting impacted by volume there.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: And you would expect that to kind of bleed lower through the rest of the year or you expect to sustain that?
Dan Comas: I think we would be at that sort of level which would be a decline year-on-year, but nowhere near what you would expect given the revenue decline as they have done such a good job on the cost side and we are working on other actions as we speak.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: Good morning, guys.
Larry Culp: Hey, Scott.  
Dan Comas: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley:  Is there anyway – I know it's hard, but is there anyway to kind of quantify the payback time period of the restructuring when you think about maybe the tailwind you could see in 2010?
Larry Culp: Well, I think that certainly when we talk about spending the 150 to 170, we're still trying to pin down a few things. But as we have accelerated that list of projects, got clearly we're incorporating a few that have a little longer payback in them. But again I think it's probably $140 million that by and large we should walk into '010 with. We're clearly not going to try to get too far ahead of ourselves. We typically talk about the next year in December, not April. But I think when I step back and look at what we will have accomplished on the cost side exiting 28 facilities, 4,000 positions between what we did last year and what we keyed up for this year, in addition to all the other cost reduction measures that have put in place, couple that with some of the revenue dynamics that we talked about, the channel destocking, some of the share gains – and note, we're not a big backlog Company so we're not working off a lot of backlog here. I think the reality of the economy is kind of front end center for us right now, not to mention the billion dollars of cash sitting there earning less than 1%, that I would hope that we deploy this year in some smart acquisitions. So whenever this economy flushes itself out, I like where we're going to be. I think when those end markets come back we're going to be well positioned to be full beneficiaries.
Dan Comas: Scott, it's obviously early, but our best look of what we plan to do for the balance of the year, as Larry mentioned, it will be $140 million annualized benefit. We think we'll get about 50 of that primarily in the second half so a net benefit going into 2010, we're about looking around 90 million.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Good precision. And maybe I'm just tense here on Thursday morning but I didn't understand the tax credits. Can you just remind us where they come from again?
Dan Comas: Sure. We've kind of highlighted on our filings the potential reduction of tax reserves over the last couple years and then our K we thought we have up to about $150 million of reduction of tax reserves. These relates to the expectation of a favorable settlement of prior year audits or the statute of limitations on audits and other reviews. We've been able to sort of kind of fine tune in our best look, obviously it could change a little bit, over the next couple quarters we think we'll book about a $100 million after-tax benefit of reduction of prior year tax reserves.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then last question, just more specifically on product ID, the 8% down volumes wasn't really that bad when you look at your comps, better than comps. Was there any timing issues of contracts or share shifts, anything that kind of explains your outperformance there?
Larry Culp: Well, it would appear – it's early obviously and looking at the full comp set, I think the Calypso printer is doing well at BJ. I think our consumables business seems to have held in better than perhaps it has elsewhere. And it was a positive quarter four exactly so relatively to the timing of some of their programs so I really roll those three together, Scott.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Thanks, guys.
Larry Culp: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Inch of Merrill Lynch.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning.
Dan Comas: Good morning, John.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys. So Dan, you called out the linearity of your order trends, but if you guys were to look at the more cyclical components of Danaher, they call it motion, some of the other companies have called out economic or end market stability in March and April. Are you seeing that kind of a trend of stability in some of the more economically sensitive or non-consumable pieces of Danaher, just maybe talk a little bit about that progression through April?
Larry Culp: John, I think we're optimistic about where we stand from a competitive perspective there, but I'm not sure we would declare stability given the storm that we're in here on the back of a couple of weeks worth of orders. But I think the rate of decline clearly seems to be moderating. I think the sense that we have, particularly in those businesses, as we sit here in mid-April is different than it was in mid-January. That may well be more commentary, John, frankly on January, where it was very hard to determine where things were. Budgets weren't set. Folks were shutting down, slashing inventories and the like. So, I don't want to suggest that we're going to call a hard bottom here and now, but because we don't work through a lot of backlog, we think we are dealing with the reality of things here now in our shipments. We like the fact that we see some of that – those declines moderating and if that indeed continues for a while then perhaps we have found that bottom. But again, as you see in our guidance, we are expecting the corporation at large to decline through the course of the year on balance with the rate that we registered in the first quarter.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: So, okay, just to make sure I understand what you're saying. You're basically – we know you're conservative. You're effectively saying the rest of the year is going to be based off of what you saw in the first quarter. But that if – is it – would it be fair to say if the trend toward the end of the quarter continues, maybe you do a little better, is that fair?
Larry Culp: Well, I think that that's certainly possible, John.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Want to ask you just about Videojet. I guess Dover talked about the prospects of improvement method, going into the second half. I know that you guys have called out some sort of pushback on higher ticket items. A lot of those equipment, lot of those machines aren't that expensive. Do you think that business as you think about your businesses stands a better chance of improving as the year goes on or perhaps there is some other businesses that you would like to call out.
Larry Culp: I think there's a lot of things that team is doing with respect to new products, some things we're doing in the channel, some very smart tactics around pricing, some things that we're doing internationally that give me confidence that we're going to continue to out execute during the course of the year. We got to do that and we've certainly have some good competition which we respect, but I feel good about our ability to execute the macro backdrop there, should I think be more clear as things play out, budgets are set, factories are running at more normal rates but that all still needs to play out.
Dan Comas: John, I mean it's – if you look at the last downturn and obviously probably a different downturn, but it's at least a plausible theory because we look back at our Videojet business, we did have three, four quarters of very weak instrument sales about the time we were buying the business but it did bounce back and pretty quickly. Probably quicker than some of our other kind of equipment type businesses.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Yes, that's what I was leading to. Nothing really different about this time around versus those other times if the economy plays out similarly?
Larry Culp: Again, that was our – the experience last time.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Let me just ask one more here, more strategically. I really want to hit on the Tektronix acquisition. Larry, one of the hallmarks of your tenure of CEO has been to generate a portfolio or shift the portfolio to become less cyclical. Clearly, you couldn't have anticipated this recession. On the other hand, Tektronix has put up some pretty weak performance that debatably makes Danaher more cyclical at the margin with respect to that acquisition. So I am curious as you think about your healthy balance sheet and these opportunities, have you shaped or reshaped possible opportunities within Danaher to think somewhat differently about where you want to be focusing your resources?
Larry Culp: Well, John, I think that we've always said that the focus on the acquisitions will be around our high growth, high margin businesses, with particular emphasis around Medtech, a business we built from scratch since the last downturn. Obviously, T&M is a bigger and I would argue stronger business over the long-haul with Tek on board. Environmental still a key area of interest for us and while it's small, I'd like to think that product ID continues to garner attention for us because we think the secular trends there are important, attractive and just have lots of legs going forward. So I think that that frame is something that by and large is intact as we look at how we spend the next billion, the next $5 billion that we've got. Clearly, John, as you highlight, we want to make sure that we have growth that is sustainable, growth that is predictable and is less cyclical, less volatile as we can. But it's one dimension, not the only dimension that we look at relative to how we create value for our shareholders over the long-haul. And while I appreciate you're saying it that none of us could have predicted what we've seen here, I think when we get to the other side, what Tek and what Fluke are going to be able to do on a global basis in the markets that they serve are going to serve our shareholders very well.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Maybe just the way to also frame that is simply has there been a lesson learned given this downturn that I mean Tektronix was the biggest deal you have ever done. As you think about other acquisitions that may apply to perhaps shaping some of those future transactions or the thought process.
Dan Comas: Well, I certainly think that we – I like to think that we learn from every deal and we learn from every toss and turn of the ship in this storm whether it be that business or others. So, certainly as we look at assets, John, that we may want to bring in, how they are performing both at the top and at the bottom in this storm is something that we're analyzing very carefully.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks very much.
Larry Culp: Thank you, John.
Dan Comas: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Baliotti of FTN Equity Capital Markets.
John Baliotti – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Good morning, Larry.
Larry Culp: Good morning, John.
John Baliotti – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Seems like as we're listening to other companies report and kind of what John was alluding to earlier, it seems like a lot of the companies that are maybe calling the bottom are calling some stability to a degree actually supply into OEMs, some of them like you and also distributors that you sell into. I'm just wondering, is that inconsistent? I mean you said the rate of decline in the quarter lessened. Is that consistent what you're hearing? I'm sure you guys are monitoring some of the other quarters that are coming out from the other companies.
Larry Culp: Well, I think that – again, we're not going to try to get out too far here on the macro call. I think that we know we got hit disproportionately with some of the – I don't want to call them one-timers but the sorts of negative hits to volume like the channel destocks and the like that should moderate and the sooner we get back to end use demand, the better off I know our company will be. But as to when that occurs, we're certainly closer to it than not but I just don't think we're going to say that in the third week of March things have stabilized. But again, I would share with you that I think just the tone and the visibility to contrast mid-April here to mid-January is better. Doesn't mean we're still not talking about declines. We talked about the second quarter already but I do think that a little bit of – a little bit more clarity here though it isn't great, is going to be helpful to the psychology. And again, I think as we work through the quarter, I'd like to think when we're talking here at 90 days forward that we do have a better handle on that. But I'm cautiously optimistic in that regard, but not going to pound the table that we found that hard bottom in mid-March.
John Baliotti – FTN Equity Capital Markets: So you like to see a more sustainable trend than what you've been seeing recently?
Larry Culp: Maybe John is right relative to our posture being a bit conservative but certainly not the way we operate. Again, I think that as we look at the environment there's a lot of things that we can control that we're pleased with. It has been a rather fluid start to the year. I think there are some uncertainties still out there. A number of you had written about those. But by and large we know at a minimum those destocks are going to play themselves out here over the next quarter or so.
John Baliotti – FTN Equity Capital Markets: I mean, I think it's – I think given the environment, I think it's the right way is to not expect things to dramatically change given what you've just seen, especially given the history that your Company has and I don't think you want to change that playbook at this point.
Larry Culp: Thank you, John.
John Baliotti – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Sure.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steven Whittaker of Sanford Bernstein.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning, guys.
Larry Culp: Good morning, Steve.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Hey. Just a few questions. First, back to Tek, could you lay out in a bit more detail how you're performing versus – in terms of DBS implementation, saving estimate, margin expansion in light of the volume deleveraging there, how should we think about that sort of from a return on capital perspective and where you're headed?
Dan Comas: I mean, couple points would be, if you look at the first quarter, we – I think just to kind of put it to the Street numbers and then try to talk to some other points, we missed the top line by $60 million clearly that was the lower core growth. But our earnings came – we were a penny short of consensus but including in that was $0.03 of restructuring. We also had about a penny from litigation settlement and expense as well. And our decremental margins were in the low 20s and with a business with gross margins in the mid-40s I think it gives you a sense of kind of the benefit of the Q4 restructuring. I think overall we were very pleased with sort of the payback we're getting at what we did in Q4.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Okay. But – and then diving into sort of the DBS implementation at Tek and how it's on track, I was also looking at the 225 basis point take-out on the acquisition related costs for professional instrumentation that would have changed how I thought about those margins. Just trying to get a sense for is this on track and to what at Tektronix?
Dan Comas: Steve, the $225 million was the one-time charges from Tektronix a year ago.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Yes.
Dan Comas: I'm not sure that's really (inaudible) DBS process.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Yes, but I'm looking at sort of the fact that it was we're saying that it sort of performing better versus last year and once you take that out from last year, I'm just trying to understand is to what extent is any part of the DBS implementation at Tek off track or on track, given the much tougher top line environment?
Larry Culp: Steve, I would share with you that with respect to the integration and the embrace and the use of DBS at Tek, we are ahead of where we could have ever hoped to be at this point. Again, a difficult sales environment for the business, but I think across many functions at Tektronix at senior levels, at lower levels in the organization, this team has done a fantastic job, really learning the tools, understanding the methodology, and their implementation, have done a I think just a terrific job really putting them to good use at Tektronix. I was out there just a few weeks ago at their engineering conference. I just saw lots of examples where their new product development processes had been improved, certainly within manufacturing, selling, and back offices, just we could take the rest of this call talking about the job that they've done to improve deliveries, to improve efficiencies reduce costs, be more innovative. I like the way that business is performing from that perspective but obviously like more revenue. It would be more impactful on a call like this, but I think you should have no worries about where that team is with respect to DBS.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: Okay. And then on the restructuring, additional restructuring dollars, how are you thinking about – how should we think about allocating that across the different businesses?
Larry Culp: Well, I think that, again, we bit off quite a bit last year, Steve, and the execution has to-date been very good. So the further acceleration I think is timely for us, not to mention the economy. I think that as we look at the execution, all businesses are going to be impacted in one way or another. But as you might expect, those businesses that are feeling the brunt, the full brunt of the downturn are going to be more active in this next waive of cost reductions. So the spend and the benefit will correlate pretty well with the revenue that we turn in here in the first quarter and in turn what we're talking about for the rest of the year.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein: And then just one final sort of more micro question in terms of the spending in municipalities on water quality and water infrastructure. Is the – how do you view sort of the trade-off between financing problems, lower tax base, et cetera and potential additional stimulus coming out there in your businesses?
Larry Culp: Well, certainly the – where we see that playing out today, we have really seen no impact whatsoever at Trojan, those big programs which by and large are hard to stop have continued well. I think we've seen some trimming, some postponing, some uncertainty around muni budget that have impacted some of the instrumentation sales. And I would say that's not only a U.S. phenomenon. We saw a bit of that in Europe as well and in parts of Asia. But consumable sales have stayed very steady. All those businesses I suspect will be beneficiaries not in big chunks but in more subtle, more persistent, and consistent ways from any stimulus spending that we may see, again, not only here, but elsewhere around the world.
Steven Whittaker – Sanford Bernstein:  Okay. Thank you.
Larry Culp: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And we'll go next to Richard Eastman of Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Just a quick follow-up again on Tektronix. Did you say or did Dan say that the operating margin in the first quarter was 15%? Does that exclude any restructuring costs?
Dan Comas: That's actually – that's before the non-cash intangible amortization, but yes, that was the operating margin of the business.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And could you just size the network management piece of Tektronix just in dollars, roughly?
Dan Comas: Give me a second I give you too.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Roughly. Maybe in the meantime in terms of – nice work on the capital structure here, early in the year and the question would be as you look forward and you look into the acquisition pipeline that you have, do you feel more comfortable at this point with your ability to assess the target companies EBITDA that you're looking at. I mean we talk about stabilization of the economy and the business models. Are you feeling increasingly confident that you know what you're going to be paying for here going forward?
Dan Comas: I think the short answer there, Rick, is yes. Again, we're not trying to call a hard bottom here but with the fourth quarter and the first quarter behind us, we've seen a lot of the noise that's going to impact any potential business we would like to bring on and we can see how it has played out. Come to a point of view obviously as to what has become. So it's a bit of a pressure test, a stress test if you will to use the popular term that every business has taken here. So I think that is a constructive part of the analysis as we look to deploy that capital
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Does it lead you down the path of larger potential acquisitions given that the risk maybe is minimized, is more minimized?
Larry Culp: I think that's – I think you could have a good debate around whether that's true or not for a Company like ours. I mean small companies like the three we've just brought in, you could argue that that sort of spending mitigates risk in one way. Obviously, a large Company that we understand well, that fits well for us, where DBS is going to be applicable and add value. That's certainly a possibility and we're going to look at those just as we will the dozen or so smaller bolt-ons we typically do in the course of the year.
Dan Comas: Rick, on your question in '09 we expect Tek on to be a little greater than 25%.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Of Tek?
Dan Comas: All of Tek, which has obviously grown as they kind of outperformed the general test and measurement space.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then did you also say that Accu-Sort was up year-over-year?
Dan Comas: They were up slightly, given the timing of some projects, given obviously some cutback in spending here. We think they will be down in the second quarter.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Well, okay.
Larry Culp: But they were up slightly in the first.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: In the first. Alright. Well, finally. Hey, thanks.  
Dan Comas: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: And due to time constraints our final question comes from Nicole Parent of Credit Suisse.
Larry Culp: Our final call and maybe your final question.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: It is. Thanks, Larry. Two final questions. Could you give us a sense, I mean, you talked about U.S. and Western Europe being soft. Could you give us a sense just in the context of the incremental restructuring how much is happening in the U.S., how much is happening in Europe and where you think we are in Europe relative to the U.S. deceleration?
Larry Culp: I think that with what we – to take the second one first, Nicole, I think when you look at what we saw in the quarter, Europe and the U.S. were down pretty much in lock step with each other. I think that the way '08 played out, my own view is that the U.S. will come back sooner than Europe will or at least the moderation in the declines will occur here first in all likelihood. With respect to the additional cost actions, as we look at the U.S., non-U.S. split there, it's actually pretty well balanced again, where we have some of our cost imperatives in Europe, I think accelerating the list will allow us to take some roof tops out that are not wildly economic for us but there are things that we can still do in the U.S. which we're going to tee up as part of this acceleration.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just one last one. I think over the last 12 months to 18 months or 24 months you guys have really benefited from some strong new product introductions. You stepped up the R&D. How do we think about R&D as a percentage of sales for the remainder of the year and as you look into 2010? And how do you kind of think about investment in new products in this type of an environment?
Larry Culp: Well, I think as we reduce cost, the way we talk about it internally, we want to make sure we're dynamically allocating resources to protect the real growth drivers and to fund fully to the extent possible the good out year contributors. So you saw us hold R&D as a percent of sales in line, suggest a decline in the first quarter. By and large that was an FX effect. A little bit of the Tek restructuring and resetting there going on and a couple of the bigger programs like Calypso at BJ, AQT at Radiometer slowing their rate of spend. But I'm heading out Monday night to our innovation conference where we're going to bring that group together. I think that's a group that's very important to us. Those investments are ones by and large protected even in this environment. And I think if you look at the first quarter, where we've outperformed, I think you can attribute it to a number of the innovations that have come to market. Whether we talk about some of the new Medtech products, like the twisted file at Sybron, we talked a bit about Calypso and product ID, Gilbarco doing very well in the payment space and obviously in California around enhanced vapor recovery. So that's an important part of this business and our strategy. No less today than it was a year or five years ago and it will be the case through this year and next and going forward. No changes there.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: Good to hear. Thank you.
Larry Culp: Thank you, Nicole. Best of luck.
Operator: And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Andy Wilson for any additional or concluding remarks.

Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Andy Wilson: On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today’s call and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor section of our website Danaher.com under the heading Earnings and they will remain there following the call. Our year end Form 10-K has not yet been filed. We have included the part of the earnings release, the fourth quarter and full year income statement, year end balance sheet, full year cash flow statement. In addition, we’ve included data in the release reflecting our business segments as well as supplemental income statement data to facilitate your analysis. Also, the audio portion of the call will be archived in the investor section of our website later today under the heading web events and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of the call will also be available until January 30. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the US and 719-457-0820 internationally, with a confirmation code is 4986181. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for any late arrivals. During the presentation we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted the year over year performance. Please refer to the accompanying slide presentation, our earnings release and other related presentation materials supplementing today’s call for additional factors that impacted year over year performance. Also, all references in this presentation to earnings, revenues and other company specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher’s business unless otherwise noted. Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Included in our 2008 earnings are certain non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition for fair value adjustments to recorded inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced total net earnings by approximately $5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and approximately $44.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share for all of 2008. These charges are included in our reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. Throughout the call, all references to the non-cash acquisition related charged for Tektronix relate to these items. In addition, in 2007 charges for purchased in process research and development as well as fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue related to Tektronix acquisition reduced earnings in the fourth quarter and full year by approximately $66 million or $0.20 per diluted share. I’d also like to note that we will be making some forward looking statements during the call, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward looking statements that we might make today. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward looking statements. With that I’d like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Today we reported fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.92 representing a 5% decrease from last year. Included in fourth quarter earnings were pre-tax charges of $82 million or approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to restructuring activities previously announced during the quarter as well as $0.01 per diluted share related to the non-cash acquisition charges for Tektronix. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.11 essentially flat compared to last year. We deployed approximately $82 million toward restructuring initiatives during the quarter of which approximately 60% related to SG&A activities and the remaining 40% impacted cost of goods sold. These actions resulted in the elimination of more than 1,800 positions and the closure of 13 facilities globally and are expected to generate in excess of $100 million of savings in 2009. For the full year, earnings per diluted share were $3.95 which also reflect the $0.18 of restructuring charges and include the impact of non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year 2008 were $4.23 an increase of 10.5% compared to 2007. Revenues for the quarter increased roughly 1% year over year to $3.2 billion with core revenue down 1%, acquisitions contributing 6% and a negative currency affect of 4%. Continued growth in our environmental, acute care diagnostics and life sciences businesses was offset by softening demand in certain segments of the portfolio including KaVo whose networks, product identification and tools. Our full year 2008 revenues were up 15% year over year to a record $12.7 billion with core revenues growing 2.5%.  Year over year gross margin for the fourth quarter decreased approximately 50 basis points to 45.7% primarily due to the restructuring charges. Gross margin for the full year increased 110 basis points to 46.8% due to the impact of higher gross margins in recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, leveraged from higher sales volumes in the first three quarters of the year as well as the positive impact of cost savings initiatives which more than offset fourth quarter restructuring charges. SG&A expenses were 27.1% of sales compared to 24.5% a year ago due primarily to fourth quarter restructuring charges, incremental investments and emerging market sales resources and higher SG&A levels in our newer businesses. For the full year SG&A expenses as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points to 26.3% primarily due to these same factors. For the quarter, research and development spending as a percentage of sales decreased 160 basis points to 5.3% due to the write down of in process R&D or IP R&D in the fourth quarter of last year related to the acquisition of Tektronix. After this prior year charge adjusted research and development spending as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points as we continue to invest for the future. Operating profit for the quarter was $424 million representing a 9% decrease over last year which includes the approximately $82 million of restructuring charges. Adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 4%. For the full year, operating profit was $1.9 billion a 7.5% increase over the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3% a 150 basis point decrease from 2007. Restructuring actions and related charges partially offset by the Tektronix IP R&D charges in 2007 accounted for the majority of this change. Core operating margin in the fourth quarter was essentially flat compared to the prior year despite a modest decline in core growth and the increase in R&D. For the full year our operating margin was 14.7%, a 110 basis point decrease from 2007. Restructuring actions and related charges negatively impacted full year margins by approximately 65 basis points. Core operating margin was essentially flat compared to 2007. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24%, that’s compared to 26.3% in the prior year period. Our fourth quarter tax rate includes the benefit of the research and experimentation credit which was extended as the result of the emergency economic stabilization act.  Net earnings were $306 million for the quarter a decrease of 4.5% compared to the prior year primarily resulting from restructuring charges, softer revenues and the negative impact of currency fluctuations. For the full year, net earnings were $1.3 billion an increase of 8.5% over last year. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were essentially flat compared to last year and were up approximately 13% for the full year. Despite the difficult macro economy we continue to generate record operating flows in 2008. Operating cash flow increased 9.5% to $1.9 billion for the full year. Our free cash flow was $1.65 billion an 8.5% increase over 2007. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 126% making 2008 the 17th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded our net income. The Danaher business system is the driver behind this significant and sustained cash flow performance. During the fourth quarter we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of company stock at an average price of just under $54. There are currently 2 million addition shares remaining under the existing authorization. Our ability to generate free cash flow during these challenging economic times has also allowed us to continue to strengthen our portfolio by way of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter we made six acquisitions comprising about $85 million of annualized revenue to strengthen our environmental, test and measurement and life sciences businesses. For the full year we completed a total of 17 acquisitions representing approximately $325 million of annualized revenue. We believe the acquisition environment is becoming more attractive and that we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities. We remain in excellent financial shape. In addition to the acquisitions I just mentioned and the share buy back we deployed our robust free cash flow towards reducing our outstanding net debt position by more than $1.2 billion during 2008. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of the year was 21%. Let’s turn now to some of the highlights from the operating segments. Professional Instrumentation revenues increased 13.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the full year revenues were up 37.5% with core revenues contributing 4%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 17.8% as compared to 16% last year driven primarily by core margin improvement of 130 basis points. For the full year operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 18.7% when compared to 2007 due primarily to the impact of new acquisitions principally Tektronix and the impact of restructuring actions and related charges. Environment platform revenues grew 7.5% in the quarter and 15.5% for the full year with core revenues up 6.5% in both periods. Water Quality core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the fourth quarter as our Hach Lange business continued to see solid demand across all major geographies. The team once again delivered stellar performance in China where our revenues were up by more than 20% in the quarter.  Sales of our Ultra Pure analytical solutions grew at a mid teens rate in the quarter the result of continued strength from new product sales including our new TOC or Total Organic Carbon analyzer utilized in pharmaceutical applications. ChemTreat’s revenues grew at a mid single digit rate in the quarter as continued investment in ChemTreat’s best in class sales and service organization continued to drive share gains. Trojan’s revenues grew at a mid teens rate in the quarter with broad based strength across most major geographies and applications. In China, Trojan was voted the number one disinfection brand for the second year in a row by a leading trade group. Trojan is entering 2009 with another record backlog. During the quarter we completed four acquisitions in water quality the largest of which was Sea-Bird Electronics with approximately $25 million of annualized revenue Sea-Bird Electronics provides connectivity, temperature and depth instrumentation and provides calibration services used by research institutions and government agencies to help explore and research the relationship between ocean dynamics and climate change. Sea-Bird more than doubles the size of Hach Hydromet business. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate in the quarter due in part to increased sales of payment and point of sales systems particularly in the US. In October Veeder-Root received regulatory approval from the California Air Resources Board or CARB for enhanced vapor recovery solutions. Following this approval Veeder-Root shipped more than 1,100 vapor recovery solutions to retailers contributing to their mid teens growth in the fourth quarter. Moving to Test & Measurement, revenues were up 20.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 3.5%. For the full year revenues grew 70.5% with core revenues coming in flat. Fluke core revenues decreased at a low single digit rate in the fourth quarter as robust demand for thermography products was offset by reduced sales of more traditional industrial products. Inventory reductions in distribution also negatively impacted the quarter and the currency exchange rate volatility in emerging markets particularly in Eastern Europe and in Mexico. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Hawk IR a manufacturer of infrared panel sight glasses and ports used in many of Fluke’s thermography products. Fluke network sales decreased at a mid teens rate during the quarter resulting from continued soft telecom demand as well as the affect of slower IT spending. At Tektronix revenues declined at a low single digit rate in the quarter. At Tek communications our network management business grew at a high single digit rate with a large number of new carriers added during the fourth quarter. Tek is entering 2009 with the leading share position in network management solutions and the highest backlog level the business has ever experienced. In instruments sales of oscilloscope declined at a high single digit rate primarily the result of softening market conditions and distributor partners working to reduce their inventories. In November we marked the one year anniversary of the Tektronix acquisition. Looking back over the past year we are very pleased with progress we’ve made on all fronts at Tek. The Tek team has embraced DBS and as a result we are now working a growth plan which should help us long term drive sustained growth. We remain committed to investing innovation while at the same time actively managing our bottom line. We far surpassed our one year cost reduction objectives and improved operating margin by more than 400 basis points. Despite the challenges we face on the top line in the near term we continue to believe that Tektronix represents some compelling strategic acquisition to Danaher that will deliver excellent returns to our shareholders. Moving over to Med Tech, revenues for the quarter decreased 2.5% compared to 2007 with core revenues essentially flat. For the full year revenues were up 9.5% with core revenues up 4.5%. Med Tech operating margin for the fourth quarter was 10.7% compared to 15.3% a year ago due largely to restructuring actions and related charges as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses.  Core operating margin declined 80 basis points in the quarter primarily due to lower volumes in our KaVo business. Full year operating margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% compared to the prior year primarily result of these same factors.  Starting with Dental, Sybron grew to mid single digit rate in the quarter led by strong sales to SybronEndo twisted file and total care system products as well as continuing demand for our general dentistry consumables at Kerr. Sales of our traditional orthodontia products declined in the quarter as many patients postponed orthodontic procedures due to the general economic situation. KaVo revenues declined at a mid teens rate in the quarter with a general slowdown across all major geographies in product categories. The economic downturn is significantly impacting sales of new dental equipment with many dentists delaying new investments in their practices. Notwithstanding this tough environment we experienced robust sales growth for the Gendex CB-500 our new medium field of view 3D imaging unit which we launched in Europe in the fourth quarter. For the quarter core revenues for all dental declined at a mid single digit rate. Leica core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter driven by confocal microscopy demand as well as more than 20% growth at Leica Biosystems our pathology diagnostics instrument and consumables business. We experienced growth across all major geographies with solid demand both in Asia and in North America. In 2008 Leica’s revenues surpassed the billion dollar mark more than double its revenue when we acquired the business in 2005. We are extremely pleased with this achievement and with the continued success of the Leica team.  During the quarter we acquired Surgipath Medial Industries with annual revenues of approximately $40 million. Surgipath is a manufacturer of consumables and things used in pathology laboratories. The acquisition broadens Leica Biosystems core histology offering at furthers its objective of becoming the leading provider of complete solutions for pathology labs. Radiometer’s core revenues were at a mid single digit rate for the quarter driven by strong consumable sales. Instrument sales were also healthy growing at a mid single digit rate due in part to shipments of our new compact ABL80 analyzer which was launched during the quarter. Sales of AQT in Europe are progressing well with more than 100 units currently in the field. Moving to Industrial Technology, revenues declined 4.5% in the quarter with core revenues essentially flat. For the full year revenues increased 3.5% with core revenues contributing 1.5%. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.7% a 260 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to restructuring actions undertaken in the quarter. The core operating margin improved 80 basis points in the quarter. Full year operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16% due primarily to our restructuring activities. Product Identification core revenues were down 8% in the quarter and 3.5% for the full year. Continued growth of consumable sales and service in our install base was more than offset by slowing sales in new equipment as many customers delayed making purchases. Despite the challenges based in the broader equipment market we’ve been very pleased with the early results of Videojet’s new 1,000 series family of small character ink jet printers. These printers provide customers with industry leading up time and a more predictable maintenance schedule. These products address a wide variety of coating applications in such verticals as food, beverage and pharmaceutical. Since launching the high performance CIJ 1510 in the third quarter we’ve seen strong demand with December being our highest shipment month thus far. During the fourth quarter we launched the lower price point CIJ 1210 which is ideal for lower volume printing needs. Motion revenues were down 3.5% in the quarter with core revenues contributing a 1% offset by the negative impact of currency fluctuation. Our aerospace in defense elevator and flat panel display businesses benefited from backlog reductions during the quarter but were mostly offset by soft demand in the US and Europe for standard motor and drive products and in factory automation as a result of widespread capital spending reductions. Due to the weakening of many of the major end markets we serve here we are not forecasting this level of sales performance in 2009. For the full year Motion sales increased 4% with core revenues up 1% with net positive currency affects. Moving to Tools & Components, revenues for the quarter decreased 15% with core revenues down 14.5%. For the full year core revenues decreased 3.5%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 9.8% a decrease of approximately 200 basis points from the prior year largely due to increased commodity costs primarily steel and the impact of lower production levels as well as restructuring actions and related charges. These negative factors were partially offset by insurance recoveries collected in the quarter related to a plant fire that occurred in 2007. In 2009 we expect some relief from these higher commodity cost levels as we have consumed the majority of inventory purchased in 2008 at these record price levels. Full year operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 12.2% due principally to these same factors. Mechanics’ Hand Tools core revenues declined 14.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and profession channels. During the quarter we began shipping the general mechanics tool kit for the US Government, this is a contract expected to generate over $100 million of new revenue over the next five years. For the full year Mechanics’ Hand Tools core revenue declined 6%. To wrap up, despite an unprecedented global economic slowdown we are pleased with the progress we’ve made over the last year. We enter 2009 with a stronger balance sheet having reduced our outstanding net debt by over $1.2 billion. We completed 17 acquisitions in 2008 strengthening our Med Tech, Test & Measurement and Water businesses.  Our restructuring investments that began in 2007 in which accelerated in the fourth quarter 2008 and our talented team many of who were part of the company in the last downturn have contributed to the solid results we delivered in the year and give us the ability to outperform in what we believe will be a challenging 2009. With this outlook we expect earnings per share in the first quarter 2009 to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 and we are reconfirming our full year 2009 earnings per share guidance of $3.70 to $4.10.
Andy Wilson: That concludes our formal comments. We’re now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: You gave us some sense of Motion trends and what you’re thinking for 2009 versus the fourth quarter and full year ’08. How should we think about some of the other sub segments in terms of core growth relative to what we’ve been seeing? Could you give us a sense of margin performance as well?
Larry Culp: Within Motion core or more broadly?
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: More broadly. You gave us a sense in your comments that Motion was going to be below the current trend level.
Larry Culp: As we reconfirmed the full year guidance we’re probably not of a much different mindset then we were when we saw you in December. The core outlook for 2009 is still going to be in that down 2% to down 6% for Danaher with the first quarter representing a very challenging start, the first half likely to be tougher than the second half.  If you look at the full year for a moment, if you take the midpoint of that down 2% to down 6% what we would anticipate is that the dispense of businesses, the businesses that are clearly demonstrated already in the fourth quarter here their resilience it should be safe to call flat to slightly positive. Obviously Water, dental consumables, Sybron, Radiometer and Leica then you’re talking about $4 billion of our $12 billion in revenue. The businesses that we would expect to be down low to mid single digits; Fluke, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, possibly KaVo, Product ID and certainly Tools. These businesses are going to be down mid single maybe a little bit more. F Net Tech and the company mentioned in your question Motion given what we know and given what we don’t know right now.
Dan Comas: From a margin perspective if we’re down in that core being negative 4% we would expect core margins to be down slightly year on year, 25 to 50 basis points.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: Within the Test & Measurement sub-segment could you give us a sense of the end market strength and weakness that you’re seeing like you did in the Motion?
Larry Culp: What we’re seeing is on balance at Fluke general softness, as you know we’ve got a very hot product lineup in Thermography, it’s a new application across a number of verticals. As we look at the general industrial and electronic markets that we serve there customers have pulled back, channel partners are taking a cautious position in inventories as we’ve both ended the year and have started the year. At F Net we certainly have seen both a core telecom business there and more importantly the general IT spending get pushed out, get deferred which is why they were down so much and why we think they could have a very tough ’09. At Tek we really have two different dynamics going on there. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks very good performance in our network management business. We think that’s a market space which has held up well. We believe we’re taking share. The team there is doing a very good job. General purpose instrumentation where we have about two thirds of that business clearly a global slowdown that was pronounced in the fourth quarter which again is why we have the sober outlook for that business that we do here in ’09.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: On restructuring a minor nuance but I think you actually spent a little bit less than you were indicating. Any thoughts on that and the ability to find more to do?
Larry Culp: We spent approximately $82 million in the quarter. When we were together in New York we thought we’d be somewhere in the $90 million range. The other interesting data point there is we talked about 1,700 positions being eliminated as part of that. We actually got more positions out in the quarter. We ended up about 1,800. Probably the best way to characterize it we perhaps planned a tad conservatively. The business is on balance and they executed well. We also stand by what we said in December relative to the commitment to do more in ’09. We set aside in our roll forward $40 to $60 million of additional restructuring spending this year. That of course is embedded in the guidance that we’ve offered up. I see no reason for us to pull back from that level of expectation given the uncertainties that are out there.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: On M&A that’s done in the pipeline what type of revenue impact are we looking at just what you have on hand a point or two or not even that much now that we’ve lapped Tek?
Dan Comas: We added about $300 million annualized and if you took half of that so it’s probably about a point and a half benefit going into ’09.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: On Dental, I missed what you said in Sybron could you repeat that and give us a little additional color on how weak Ortho was and the trends you’re seeing among some of the more discretionary items.
Larry Culp: Of the major pieces at Sybron the Ortho piece is probably the most discretionary but hopefully people still will invest in their children’s oral health. As we look at that business we were down modestly in the quarter but had some very nice offsets. We mentioned in the prepared remarks what we’re doing in the Endo field a number of new products there helping us drive share. Our disinfection business given all concerns in that space generally both in dental and in medical had a very good quarter. Some of the other smaller business at Sybron did as well. All in balance we’re pretty pleased with the performance. Kerr, certainly in the general consumables business saw some slowing but it was not nearly as pronounced given that many people would look at those general products, if you will, more in the pain management category far less a discretionary item than something like orthodontia or implants.
Jeff Sprague – Citi Investment Research: To be clear then Ortho is down modestly or the whole Sybron franchise is down modestly?
Larry Culp: Ortho.
Dan Comas: Sybron was up mid single digit in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: I wondered if you go back and flush out the sequence of the fourth quarter, remember we talked about October was up a little bit and November was flat then December started out so weak you guys understood the quarter was going to be negative, it came out negative just 1%. I was wondering if December finished better than it started. Maybe you could give us an idea of how January started?
Larry Culp: We did a little bit better than we thought relative to core in the quarter. When we entered December like most companies we had no idea when people were going to head home for the holidays customers. Things were not anything to brag about I think we did a little better than we anticipated so we were pleased with that. I do want to note as we mentioned a couple times already we were working down back log in a number of areas. We certainly saw orders weaken through the course of the quarter. That in large part is why we’ve offered up the type of framework, thinking about ’09 that we have.  Thus far while it’s early things haven’t been horrible but I wouldn’t say they’ve been anything to brag about by and large they have been in line with what we were thinking and what we were discussing in mid December.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: Other companies talk about de-stocking as well as end market issues. Are you able to gauge what de-stocking effect you’re seeing as a depressant on your organic growth?
Larry Culp: It’s hard to quantify that on a pan Danaher basis. We certainly saw in a number of our businesses that go to market through distribution where our sales out the door were softer than the sell through at the counter at retail as a result of those inventory reductions. It definitely happened across a number of our businesses and I would offer up that I don’t believe that that has settled out yet.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: What were orders up or down in the fourth quarter, if you referenced it I don’t remember hearing it what you said?
Dan Comas: They were down about two or three points more than the -1% on the shipments.
Bob Cornell – Barclays Capital: What’s going on with pricing and are you starting to see customers come back at you with lower commodity costs and the headlines and put pricing on you and how are you matching the price issues versus the commodity declines?
Larry Culp: We certainly are seeing isolated examples where that’s surfacing in our conversations with customers and our conversations with our businesses. I would suspect that will be an increased topic of discussion as we go out through the year just as we are with our vendor base. Given what’s happening in the commodity markets and obviously with the economy at large.  We continue to believe as we think about ’09 that we can get some positive price and get more than our fair share of the reduction in the decrease in commodity prices broadly across the portfolio. Net net that will be a positive for Danaher those two elements in 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: To pick up on that last point and to dovetail with what you said about tools and raws. Assume raw material costs now that you’ve anniversaried the higher input costs, assume that raw material costs stay where they are today. What kind of profit benefit does that give the Tool segment in 2009?
Dan Comas: Across the company at current levels it could be a 20 to 30 basis point benefit to margins. Within Tools that would the lion’s share of it so it would probably be north of 100 basis points of benefit. The offset here is the continued challenges here on the top line.
John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Do you have to give some of that back in terms of price? When Larry is describing the price is going to be up is that disproportionately weighted to some segments then Tools you expect price to be down? How should we think about that?
Dan Comas: We got about two points of price in the fourth quarter that will prove more challenging though we think it will be positive here in ’09. The areas where I think price will be stickiest will be our consumable business across Product ID, Med Tech and it will be more challenging clearly to get price in Tools though right now we’re not looking to give up price.
John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Was Tools down in price in the fourth quarter?
Dan Comas: Tools we had positive price in tools as well.
John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Emerging markets you guys are a big company in China, what are you seeing there. I understand that you’re probably outperforming but could you give us a little more color on what you’re seeing in end markets specifically China. You read about the economy in India is taking a real hit. How about a little update in terms of what’s going on in these important economics.
Larry Culp: With respect to China we certainly saw solid performance across the portfolio really up until early November. Since then China has softened significantly. We mentioned in the prepared remarks certainly Eastern Europe and Mexico, other parts of South America have been wrestling with the currency issues as well. Some of that has stabilized but by and large the turmoil that you read about it certainly is more than what we saw toward the end of the year. It’s been reduced a bit in those places, India included here at the beginning of the year. We still have a cautious view about what we can expect from those geographies in ’09.
John Inch – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Worse than what you saw before or does it ultimately is it not that significant?
Larry Culp: The currency noise added to all the underlying macro weakness in December as you saw those currencies fluctuate as they did. On the margin we’re probably more cautious about emerging markets in ’09. In general as you heard us in December we’re trying to go sober about the environment that we’re wrestling with this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa – JP Morgan
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: On the working capital front you guys did a good job on the inventories and receivables. Can you talk about the dynamics there and was there anything unusual? Receivables was a particularly strong benefit.
Dan Comas: It’s a little bit of a softer top line can help a little bit but if you look at the last couple years we’ve been able to generate pretty good cash flow out of working capital. For the full year had about $100 million of working capital contributing to cash flow. That’s something we strive for every year.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: The bad debt reserve was up about $10 million on a flat receivables basis. Anything specific going on there or is that just mix from Tektronix?
Dan Comas: Its a couple things, it’s a little bit from the new acquisitions coming in adding some revenue but it’s also a function of the environment we’re putting a little more provision on the balance sheet to recognize a more difficult time.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: On M&A environment any high level comments there, is there anything that’s changed? Have the seller’s expectations come down or are they all still sitting out there thinking these valuations are actually low?
Larry Culp: Everybody is a little different. We view ’09 as the year in which we should have plenty of opportunity to make good smart investments to build out our portfolio. We know that in both public and private situations the havoc that this economy is laying in will create situations where valuations will come in; companies may lose some of the strategic options they once had and will make a conversation with Danaher attractive. Certainly that will be attractive to us as well. We’re optimistic that we’re going to be putting some capital to work this year to build out Danaher for the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: The first question is about Western Europe. You talked about Eastern Europe and China being weakening toward the end of the year. Could you give some color as to linearity in Western Europe and your expectations going into the first half of this year?
Larry Culp: We saw Western Europe not unlike the US flopping through the quarter. We’re slightly positive in Europe in the quarter but very much would expect Europe not unlike the US to come in in ’09 or at least Danaher in that context to come in that down 2% to down 6% range. I don’t think we’re expecting a wildly different ’09 in Western Europe then we are elsewhere.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: About China, if you have the numbers handy could you give us what percentage of revenue that formed in the 2008 growth that we saw? You talked about things being weaker over there this year what kind of growth rate by you folks internally planning or expecting out of China?
Dan Comas: I’m not sure I understood the first part of the question.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: The percentage of the overall revenues how material is China?
Dan Comas: It’s about 8%.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: The growth rate the business experienced in ’08 and what you’d expect that to be growing, you’re Chinese business, sales in China and what you’d expect that to be in 2009?
Dan Comas: Through the first three quarters we’re probably up approximately low double digit. For the fourth quarter China was flat year on year. The expectation is for the full company Larry mentioned being down 2% to 6%. China could be in that range maybe a little bit better. We’re not expecting a lot of growth in any geography in ’09 right now.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Looking at your share buybacks you talked about varieties of cash could you walk us through right now how you’re looking at share buybacks at what point you’d be more aggressive there.
Dan Comas: We did buy back about 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. We do, as you know in our history, will find periods of time where we think it’s a very attractive opportunity, an opportunity to take some stock out of the system. Given our significant debt reduction in ’08 given the strong cash flow we expect in ’09 I would expect that the lion’s share of that liquidity goes toward building out the portfolio. Though there’s always the potential element for a small portion of buybacks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: I want to dig a little bit into the M&A side and the question is where is the sweet spot now where deal multiples are coming down and there’s a reality among the seller that not only do multiples have to come down but the denominator also has to come down as far as what’s perceived as mid cycle earnings. Is there a certain sweet spot or do you have to go to larger or there are a lot smaller deals. What do you think there?
Dan Comas: I’m not sure I could give you a good generalization there. The market’s really been down here for two quarters. That helps. People are more nervous out there, that makes it more challenging for all of us here on the call. That bodes well for the environment where you have companies public and private both showing bad numbers but also forecasting tougher numbers as well. That tends to be where you begin to see a rational seller. I’m not sure we’re quite there yet but I think its coming.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: On restructuring which segments do you feel like you still have some wood to chop to get capacity down to match up with the demand outlook?
Larry Culp: I think all the businesses still have opportunity. We talk about somewhere in the $50 million range being set aside in ’09. I would anticipate that that will be broadly distributed across the portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: On the acquisition question from where you sit now do you think you’ll do anything transformational this year or more bolt on nature?
Larry Culp: A lot of things in ’09 it’s a little hard to say given what may come. The general approach that we’ve used in the past is likely to be the one that you see play out this year. We put capital to work; we’re going to be focused on the bolt ons that you saw us do in ’08. I suspect the larger deals be it $500 million, $1 billion will be a larger part of what we do in ’09 then they were last year. Those are the situations that Dan was referencing a moment ago that will be good additions for us. As we go through the year clearly the focus will be on adding to the environmental, the Med Tech, the T&M, the Product ID segments. Could there be another platform flag out there planted in ’09? It’s possible but I think there’s so much going on just in those four businesses where we do about $8 billion of our $12 billion revenue. That $8 billion is against the market back drop of about $50 billion. I suspect we’ll stay close to home.  The transformational situation those are always unlikely but if they’re going to happen it may be more likely to happen in a tumultuous environment like this. I suspect most of the capital if not all will be spent close to home.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: On the consumables, I was a little bit surprised to see that grow in the mid single digits given that IP is down 5% in both US and Europe. Do you think that continues to grow into ’09 or do you think it will weaken as we go through?
Larry Culp: The reference was to the consumables business at Sybron.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: No, this is at Videojet.
Larry Culp: That’s one we’re going to watch very closely. We thought that part of the Product ID portfolio was more defensive, more resilient. I think it’s demonstrated as much. It is one that we’re going to watch. Keep in mind that a lot of the verticals that we serve there are going to be a little bit more stable then IP just broadly defined food, beverage and the like. It’s a fair question.
Nigel Coe – Deutsche Bank: On FX it was little bit of a headwind from FX this quarter than expected. The Japanese Yen has been pretty strong you do have a bit more exposure to Japan. Is that going to be a slight positive factor for you in ’09?
Dan Comas: It is but it pales in comparison to the impact of the Euro. What we said in December it being about an impact of $0.05 or $0.06 in the first quarter. It may be more like $0.05 now but it’s pretty small.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wendy Caplan – Wachovia
Wendy Caplan – Wachovia: You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you’d gained some share at Tek. Can you talk about your strategy, your market share gain strategy in these tough times? Is it strictly new products or geographies or markets or does it say something about your willingness to address pricing share?
Larry Culp: We certainly don’t want to display the price card in any environment. We did a nice job in that regard in ’08 getting price and getting share in a lot of places. What we want to do in an environment like this is make sure we continue to stay focused first and foremost on the customer. When you’re taking a lot of costs out it easy to get focused internally. Much of what we’re trying to do with our sales and marketing team is make sure we still have that external orientation.  Much of what we’ve implemented around our I2E or Ideas execution initiative the last several years has been geared towards being more effective in the marketplace with our sales force, with our marketing messages and the like. When we’re at a point where we are in several businesses where our R&D investments are the last several years our delivering new products you see that at Tek, you see that at Videojet, Sybron’s got a number of nice offerings right now. Those two come together and give us the ability to play some offence. We talked a little bit in New York as well around our dynamic resource allocation approach to funding. The key in this environment is to be tight on costs but not at the expense of the growth drivers in the business. We really do all we can to protect the short term investments around sales and marketing but longer term investments around R&D and go get the costs out elsewhere. That’s the mindset, that’s the approach, the DBS approach to taking share in ’09 that we’re going to work all of our businesses this year.
Wendy Caplan – Wachovia: Do you anticipate, given all the restructuring any meaningful management changes in ’09?
Larry Culp: No. We just announced as you saw a few weeks ago a handful of group executive promotions which we were excited about. A number of people have grown up in the business taking on additional responsibilities and being so recognized. No. We’ve got a heck of a team here and we want to make sure this team stays together and does what we know we can do to outperform in ’09.
Operator: Your last question comes from Richard Eastman – Robert Baird
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: On the Water business you bundled that into the Med Tech group in terms of an ability to show growth this year in ’09. Could you quickly walk through Hach and Lange, Trojan as the backlog still there, what gives you the confidence here that that business will grow?
Larry Culp: You’re right, when we talk about the most resilient parts of the portfolio we certainly look just to the fourth quarter and we see Radiometer doing what we thought it would do, certainly Leica as well, Sybron so we have most of Med Tech. Water has many of the same structural characteristics that’s held well. Those businesses are about $4 billion. There’s probably another billion of consumables at Videojet, after market businesses so we have about $5 billion of the $12 billion that you would lump together having that sort of resiliency. As we look at Hach Lange whether its regulatory issues, whether it’s the optimization in efficiency initiatives that many of our customers are pursuing the emerging market trends all of that comes together and gives us the view that that business will do better than most of the portfolio in ’09. With what the President has proposed over the weekend with respect to waste water and drinking water funding if that comes about clearly both Hach Lange and Trojan should be well positioned. Trojan is certainly well positioned from a backlog perspective. We came into ’08 with record backlog. We come here into January with a better level of backlog for ’09. We’re bullish about that. [Kentry] has continued to hold up well, continues to take share. A lot of good things going on in Water right now. We all know the type of environment we’re dealing with there are very few certainties. Those businesses in part led by Water should lead the way for us this year.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: From a macro economic context and maybe top down, when you look out into ’09 are you expecting a recovery in the second half globally? I know we’re talking about down 2% to 6% but does it graduate up do we end the year at flat to slightly up, does it take that type of macro perspective or are we pretty much assuming the economy stays down and flat.
Larry Culp: The framework that we’re offering here is really rooted on the comps getting easier for us in the second half at a minimum. Clearly a lot of government activity going on around the work trying to stop the hemorrhaging. At some point that has to take effect. As we mentioned in answer to your first question there are some things within our control. It’s really that framework that we offer up here as a way to think about 2009. We’re going to make sure that we continue to stay tight on costs given the uncertainties. We’re going to work to protect our downside so that we can outperform this year come what may.
Operator: That will conclude today’s question and answer session. For closing remarks I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wilson.

Operator: Welcome to the Danaher Corporation third quarter 2008 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Andy Wilson: Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, Form 10-Q, a slide presentation supplementing today’s call and reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on our Investor section of our website which is up and running at www.danaher.com, under the heading Earnings and will be available following the call. In addition the audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investor section of our website later today under the heading Web Events and will remain achieved until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until October 22. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the US and 719-457-0820 internationally, and the confirmation code is 2942719. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for any late arrivals. During the presentation we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted the year-over-year performance. Please refer the accompanying slide presentation and other related presentation materials supplementing today’s call as well as the MD&A section of our third quarter Form 10-Q for details regarding additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Also, all references in this presentation to earnings, revenues and other company specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher’s business unless otherwise noted. Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in our earnings are certain non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition for fair value adjustments to recorded inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced total net earnings by approximately $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter and approximately $39 million or $0.12 per diluted share year-to-date.  These charges are included in our reported results for the third quarter and year-to-date 2008, but are excluded from the adjusted earnings per share guidance that we will provide at the end of the prepared remarks.  The amount of these non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition is expected to reduce our earnings by approximately $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.13 per share for the full year 2008. Throughout the call all references to non-cash acquisition-related charges for Tektronix relate to these items. I’d also like to note that we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward-looking statements. With that I’d like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Andy thank you, good morning everyone. Today we reported third quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.11 representing an 8% increase over last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $1.14, a 13% increase over last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 17.5% to $3.2 billion with core revenues up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 11% and we had a positive currency effect of 2.5%.  Continued strength in our water quality and med tech businesses and improved performances in motion and Gilbarco Veeder-Root was partially offset by continued soft demand at Fluke Networks and at Accu-Sort.  Year-to-date revenues are up 20.5% to $9.5 billion as core revenues grew 4%. Year-over-year gross margins for the third quarter improved approximately 140 basis points to 47.1% primarily due to the impact of higher gross margin in the newly acquired businesses, leverage from higher sales volumes, as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives.  In addition higher commodity costs incurred in the quarter were mitigated somewhat by price increases.  SG&A expenses were 25.1% of sales compared to 24% a year ago due primarily to higher SG&A levels in our newer businesses and incremental investment in emerging market sales resources.  R&D spending as a percentage of sales for the quarter was 5.7% as compared to 4.8% a year ago. This increase was largely due to the impact to Tektronix as well as investment in our med tech businesses. Operating profit for the quarter was $522 million representing a 13% increase over last year. Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter increased 15.5% compared to last year.  Year-to-date operating profit was $1.4 billion, a 13.5% increase over last year and year-to-date adjusted operating profit increased 18.5% compared to the same period a year ago.  Our operating margin in the third quarter was 16.3%, a 70 basis point decrease from last year. The impact of newer businesses, including the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix negatively impacted margins by approximately 65 basis points. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was essentially flat compared to the adjusted operating margin last year as fall through from core revenues was offset by investments in R&D and sales force initiatives, continued restructuring, and hopefully a high watermark for commodity prices. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 24.5% as compared to 23.6% in the prior year period. Our overall tax rate was slightly less then we experienced in the first half of 2008 as a result of the mix of domestic and international earnings.  We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% which would include the benefit of the research and experimentation credit which was recently extended as a result of the emergency economic stabilization act.  Net earnings were $372 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Year-to-date net earnings were $1 billion, an increase of 13%.  Adjusted net earnings for the third quarter and first nine months improved 16.5% and 18.5% respectively compared to the prior year.  Our operating cash flow for the first nine months was $1.3 billion, 19.5% higher then the prior year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.2 billion representing a 20% increase.  Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 108% for the third quarter and stands at 122% for the first nine months. We are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 17th year in a row. Our ability to generate free cash flow during these challenging economic times has allowed us to continue to strengthen both our balance sheet and our portfolio by way of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter we made four acquisitions, comprising about $150 million of revenue making key additions to our environmental, test and measurement, and dental platforms. We believe the acquisition environment continues to become more attractive and that we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities.  We believe we are in terrific financial shape. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced our outstanding debt by approximately $1 billion and our debt to total capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 21%. In addition we had over $285 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter’s end.  Now turning to some of the highlights from the operating segments, professional instrumentation revenues were up 38% for the quarter and 48% year-to-date with core revenues up 4.5% for both periods. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 20.1% as compared to 22.7% last year as the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix essentially accounted for the difference.  Year-to-date operating margins decreased 290 basis points to 19% when compared to last year due principally to these same factors.  Environmental revenues grew 9.5% with core revenues up 6% in the quarter. Year-to-date sales increased 18.5% with core revenues contributing 6.5%. Water quality core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the third quarter as our Hach Lange business continued to see solid demand in both their process and laboratory product lines including healthy growth in consumables and service revenues. Geographically a strong performance in Europe and continued double-digit growth in China drove this performance. ChemTreat achieved low double-digit revenue growth in the quarter representing their best quarter of this year. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Arcan Environmental, a manufacturer of UV or ultraviolet treatment solutions which will compliment Trojan’s existing low flow product offerings.  At Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter as increased sales of payment and point-of-sale systems was partially offset by soft dispenser sales. Veeder-Root is awaiting final California Air Resources Board or CARB, approval for its enhanced vapor recovery solutions which helps retailers reduce hydrocarbon emissions and comply with state regulations.  We anticipate receiving this approval in the fourth quarter of this year.  During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Autotank Group based in Finland which we highlighted during our last call.  Moving to test and measurement revenues grew 94% in the quarter and approximately 100% year-to-date with core revenues up 1.5% in each period. In Fluke core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate for the quarter led by strong emerging market growth and continued demand for our lower price point thermography products.  Our green initiatives aimed at increasing energy efficiency helped drive low double-digit growth for our indoor air quality and digital multi meter products this quarter. Additionally Fluke was awarded more than $20 million of government contracts in the quarter.  During the third quarter we also completed the acquisition of Janos Technology which added to optical component design and manufacturing capability to Fluke’s high growth thermography business.  Fluke Network sales were down double-digit during the quarter resulting from continued soft sales to telecom carriers as well as the effect of slower IT spending which has impacted our higher end enterprise performance management products. As we indicated on our last call we expect FNET results to remain challenging for the balance of this year.  At Tektronix revenues were down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter as double-digit core revenue growth at TEK Communications was offset by weaker demand in our instruments business. Recent product launches in our Oscilloscope product line drove low double-digit growth in the distributor segment of that business. Our network management business grew more then 20% in the quarter due in part to a multi million dollar contract win. Telstra, Australia’s leading telecom and information services company will deploy TEK’s market leading unified assurance network management suite which will provide end to end monitoring solutions throughout Telstra’s high-speed wireless broadband network.  We are very pleased with TEK’s performance particularly regarding their high teens operating margin in the quarter which excludes the non-cash acquisition related charges. It is a testament to the hard work of the TEK team and the impact of DBS. It’s been a very good first year together with Tektronix. Over at med tech revenues for the quarter increased 12.5% compared to 2007 and core revenues were up 5.5%. year-to-date revenues increased 14% with core revenues growing 6%.  Med tech operating margin for the third quarter was 12.3% compared to 13% a year ago due to increased spending on growth initiatives, which has driven above market growth at both Leica and Radiometer, higher costs at our cable operation and the impact of lower operating margins from some recent acquisitions. year-to-date operating margins also declined 70 basis points to 11.5% compared to the prior year; a result of these same factors.  Core revenues in our dental business grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter. Sybron was up at a mid single-digit rate led by demand for general dentistry consumables and strength in both our SybronEndo and [Odonic] and our total care infection prevention product lines.  SybronEndo was up a at high single-digit rate in the quarter due to strong sales of their new Twisted File product line as well as the launch of RS1, a resin based bond used to protect the root canal wall and prevent infection an endodontic or a root canal treatment.  Also during the quarter we acquired [Pentron Corporation] which provides complimentary consumable products for endodontic and other restorative applications at Sybron.  KaVo grew to low single-digit rate in the quarter as continued strong demand for our imaging products was partially offset by a general slowing of instrument and treatment unit sales.  At Radiometer core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate for the quarter driven primarily by strong consumable sales across all major geographies. Instrument places grew at a mid single-digit rate with particular strength in portable applications due in part to the launch of the ABL80 Analyzer.  Leica core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter driven by compound microscopy demand as well as more then 20% growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostics business.  We experienced growth across all major geographies with solid demand in both Asia and Europe. During the quarter we launched the new DCM 3D [confocal] microscope, which provides fast and accurate surface assessment required for metrology applications. Customer demand for the launch has been very positive.  Moving to industrial technologies, revenues increased 6% for the quarter with core revenues up 3.5%. year-to-date revenues increased 6% with core revenues contributing 2%. The operating margin for the third quarter was 18.2%, a 120 basis point increase compared to the same period last year, a result of restructuring efforts undertaken earlier this year.  year-to-date operating margins decreased 40 basis points to 16.7% due primarily to a prior year gain on indemnity proceeds from a litigation matter and the sale of real estate which benefited 2007 margins by approximately 60 basis points. Product ID core revenues were down 3% in the quarter, our traditional marking and coding business grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter led by strength in consumables. Offsetting this performance was the continuation of large parcel project delays and the reduction in traditional US PS projects at Accu-Sort. Year-to-date product ID sales increased 3% with core revenues down 1.5% due again to the softness at Accu-Sort.  Over in motion, revenues were up 8% in the quarter with core revenues contributing 5% growth. Growth in our aerospace and defense, elevator, flat panel display and medical vertical markets were the key drivers to this performance.  Partially offsetting this growth was continued soft demand in the US and Europe for standard motor and drive products. year-to-date sales are up 6.5% with core revenues contributing 1%. During the quarter Kollmorgan announced an agreement with Volvo to produce electrical motors and drives for Volvo’s fleet of heavy duty hybrid vehicles.  These hybrid applications represent a multi million dollar strategic opportunity for the Kollmorgan team.  Finally moving over to tools and components revenues for the quarter and year-to-date are up 1% with core revenues contributing about half a percentage point in each period. operating margin for the quarter was 14%, a decline of approximately 190 basis points from the prior year largely due to increased commodity costs, principally steel, and the impact of lower production levels offset somewhat by price increases. year-to-date operating margins decreased 60 basis points to 13% due principally to these same factors.  Mechanics’ hand tools revenues increased 1% in the quarter primarily due to the initial stocking order of our GearWrench brand of tools at Advance Auto Parts which we referenced during our last call.  year-to-date mechanics’ hand tools core revenues declined 2.5%.  So to wrap up our prepared remarks we were quite pleased with our growth, earnings, cash flow performance, and the strength of our balance sheet. We have continued our restructuring investments that we began late last year and believe these actions have helped our businesses deliver these good results.  But given the events of the last month more challenges are clearly on the horizon. We are keenly aware of the impact of the constrained credit markets and the effect the constrained credit markets are having and will likely continue to have on the global economy. Accordingly we believe it is prudent to accelerate the pace of our restructuring activities. As a result we are currently estimating an additional investment of approximately $75 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter to fund additional cost reduction and restructuring activities.  These activities will likely result in the reduction of over 1,000 positions and the closure of a dozen facilities. We believe these actions which will affect a number of our businesses will better position us in 2009 and beyond.  With that as a backdrop we expect adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.25 excluding the non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition and before the restructuring charges.  We expect our full year 2008 adjusted earnings per share to be $4.29 to $4.37 which excludes the acquisition charges related to TEK, the benefit of the $0.03 per share of discrete tax items realized in the second quarter, and again the fourth quarter restructuring charges. The mid point of our full year adjusted guidance represents a 13% increase compared to prior year’s earnings per share and a 9% increase after taking into account a $0.17 per share impact from the anticipated fourth quarter restructuring. We have often said that Danaher is positioned to outperform during difficult times and now is certainly one of those times. We believe that the composition of our portfolio, combined with our disciplined execution, via DBS, and the strength of our balance sheet will help us achieve positive results going forward.  I am confident that our talented and seasoned team can execute on the business plans we have in place. In turbulent times we believe our ability to be nimble and to react quickly to changing market conditions will help us capture additional market share from our competitors and to set us apart from many of our peers.  We are now ready for questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Cornell – Barclay’s Capital 
Robert Cornell – Barclay’s Capital : You gave the fourth quarter guidance and earnings but not the core growth comment, what is the core growth contribution in the fourth quarter that drives the fourth quarter earnings you mentioned?
Larry Culp: I think if you look across the portfolio and the way we finished the third quarter we’re actually continuing to see a good level of strength across many of the businesses. But as we look to the fourth quarter clearly we’ve got a rather tempered outlook in light of the headlines and the concerns about the macro economy. I think right now when we look at the fourth quarter we think core will be positive but at a rate below the 4% year-to-date number that we’ve registered.  If you take a quick run through the segments I think instrumentation will be up low to mid single-digits, we would expect T & M and water to continue to set the pace. I think we’ll see some softness at Gilbarco again because of the soft dispenser demand. Obviously with prices at the pump coming down that means margins are good, maybe there’s a little bit of year end money there, we’ll see.  At med tech I think we’re probably in the same range there, low to mid. We just had a few weeks back we were over in Europe with a number of the businesses for their strategic reviews. I feel very good about the share take at Leica, at Radiometer, I think we’re also very pleased with where Sybron is. Obviously work to do at KaVo. I’d say at KaVo clearly the 179 tax incentive is a bit of a wildcard here in the fourth quarter, we’ll see how that plays out.  And keep in mind I think with instrumentation and med tech we’re talking about two-thirds of Danaher today. Industrial tech is probably pretty much inline; maybe slightly below where they were in the third quarter, call that low singles. And I think tools will be down probably low singles again, largely because of the retail softness and what may come in that regard. 
Robert Cornell – Barclay’s Capital : When did you start putting together the $75 million plan and maybe give a little more detail, it sounds like a lot but then in the environment we’re in, its sort of understandable so maybe flush out how you evolved the $75 million restructuring plan and how much it might benefit 2009 and 2010?
Larry Culp: It’s hard to pick a date as to when we began simply because as you know we’re always in this mode. We’ve been on a steady pace I think of restructuring since the second half of last year when we began to have concerns about the trajectory of the economy. Obviously couldn’t call what’s happened here in the last month, but certainly given recent events we’re of the view that we should accelerate the plans that have been on the drawing boards as we get ready for 2009. So what we’re really talking about doing in essence is pulling forward many of the plans, thoughts, what have you that were under discussion and were likely to have been put in place over the next say four to eight quarters. So we’re pulling those in, we’re accelerating. Clearly we want to be respectful to our associates, these are plans that are still being worked through and finalized so I want to be careful about the specifics that we provide externally until we complete our internal communications, but as you would guess the businesses that are going to be perhaps most impacted are those with lower margins currently, those that are feeling or likely to feel the impact of the economy most directly. But again its widespread and even some of our higher margin, better performing businesses we’ll be taking some actions here to get ready for what may come. So again we are talking about 1,000 or more net positions being reduced, a dozen facilities and we’re looking at that as again a $75 million number approximately. There’s a band there of plus or minus $5 or $10 million given what we can get done this year.  The majority of it will be a cash charge and we would expect to get more or less a one year pay back on what we do. We’ll keep you very well apprised of the details once we get through budgets in November at our Analyst Meeting in early December in New York and we’ll give you a full update at that time. But that’s really where we are right now. I think it’s the right thing to accelerate these actions given the environment we’re in. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Can you give us a quick update on the current financing status; it looked like just to clarify on where you stand on commercial paper, your ability to term that out and if you’re also on the other side seeing any stresses on the credit situation on your customers today?
Dan Comas: We’ve really in the first nine months have done a lot to really substantially improve the balance sheet. We’ve paid down $1 billion of debt; our debt to total cap is all the way down to 21%. At the end of September we had approximately $500 million of commercial paper. That’s backed up by a bank facility that’s three times the size of that and a facility that does not expire until 2012. in terms of CP we’re really benefiting from two things, one is we’re a top tier credit and A1/P1 credit but two as importantly in this environment just the absolute size of our program is relatively modest.  So we’ve had not issues accessing capital. We just paid off yesterday our $250 million US bond. We did that entirely with CP. We had no issues accessing that capital and we also have a favorable interest arbitrage on that. We paid off the bond which was at 6%. We were able to issue CP with about a month duration at approximately 2% today. So at least to date, we’ve had no issues accessing the CP market. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: And then the comment about the how the credit cycle now is affecting your customers?
Larry Culp: We can’t point to a distinct trend in any way. I think what we’ve seen thus far has been a methodic, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks clearly the consumer facing businesses, small part of Danaher of course but that’s where we’re seeing softness. You can relate that to what’s happened here. I think we’re seeing some of our larger corporate customers delay, push out in some cases cancel some higher ticket discretionary purchases. I’m not sure that’s as much a function of their inability to access capital as much as it is them taking actions unlike our own.  I think we have seen a number of situations though, this is episodic where I think some of our businesses that go-to-market through distribution are picking up some share and partnership with some of our larger distributors who clearly are able to finance their operations. Probably taking share from some smaller distributors, smaller businesses who are having, on the front lines if you will of what we’ve all been reading about. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: On the med tech at 5.5% core revenues are you immune from some of the headwinds, hospital CapEx freezes, because of the price points on the Radiometer products and so forth and are you feeling any sort of pressure there?
Larry Culp: I wouldn’t say that we’re immune either at Radiometer or Leica, that would be sheer [inaudible] on our part but obviously the performance of the business speaks for itself. But I think we have seen in the US certain projects, purchase decisions being pushed out, taking a little longer to get approved but we haven’t seen wholesale cancellations or anything getting hung up because as you point out our instrument price points are rather modest and again particularly at Radiometer, 70% of that business are the consumables that are really a function of procedure and patient flow not capital financing. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch - Merrill Lynch
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: If you could put this charge into a context, how does this compare given you’ve done some restructuring action earlier last year throughout this year, and then how does this compare with 2001 the charge you took then, and then the portfolio today, what sort of a backdrop does this assume? Are you assuming as bad a recession as then because we obviously want to know what are the obvious risks that you’re going to have to do this again in six months if the economy continues to deteriorate?
Larry Culp: I think again this is an acceleration of the work we began in the second half of last year. Without trying to pinpoint our outlook for 2009 I think you should interpret the announcement here this morning as has Danaher accelerated a program well underway, Danaher doing as much as it can here in the short-term to get ready for what I think will be a very challenging 2009. we’ll take the businesses through budgeting as you know here in the month of November and come out of those sessions and brief you on the detailed outlook for 2009 because we’re always in the mode of taking cost out by way of DBS, taking these sorts of actions. I don’t think this is necessarily the sum total of what we’re going to do but we’ll take you through any additional updates or actions in December.  But what we do in 2009 will fall short of what we’re talking about here this morning. 
Dan Comas: What we did six, seven years ago was a number that was a little bit smaller then the $75 million but of course the business was about a quarter of the size. I would add that over the last four quarters through the end of the third quarter we’ve probably done approximately $40 million restructuring, averaged about $10 million a quarter during the last four quarters and almost regardless I would expect that pace to continue in 2009.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: So the $75 doesn’t pull forward all you’re anticipated restructuring in 2009 you’re saying that’s in response to the environment. You’re still going to do this continuous pay as you go restructuring--?
Dan Comas: And there will likely be some tails in some of the restructuring that we’re doing right now, but there’ll be other pay as you go, that is the normal course here for us particularly in any sort of challenging environment. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: So as we think about the environment tools obviously the core growth could go negative there next year, but how are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio. Do you believe that despite what is obviously a big drop off in the last few weeks, do you think that the rest of Danaher can sustain positive organic growth through 2009?
Larry Culp: That would certainly be the head set we would take into budgeting. I think we all recognize that we are in a rather unprecedented situation here as what’s happened on Wall Street spreads out to Main Street. I don’t think our crystal ball is any more clear in this regard then anyone else’s. I think we’re pleased with the way the businesses performed in the third quarter and while there’s uncertainty we think we’ve got a much better portfolio going into tougher times then we did back in 2001. These med tech businesses for example, with all of them recently for our strat reviews and just walked away feeling very good about the investments they want to make, the opportunities they have and that’s not to sell short anything we have going on in instrumentation or elsewhere. I think our businesses are going to play offense in this environment. We’re going to play offense with respect to M&A but I think it would just be sheer folly for us to sit back and not be in a mode where we’re accelerating this activity, this restructuring activity, preparing the cost structure while protecting our investments for what could be a very challenging period here in the months to come. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse 
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse : Could you characterize what you felt September looked like for us, meaning you were more conservative throughout the year in terms of just bracing for a downturn, we heard a lot about Europe falling off a cliff in July and August and then also with the credit crunch what happened the last two weeks of September, give us a sense by geography what you saw?
Larry Culp: I think for the quarter we saw positive growth across all geographies. The US hung in there and even there at the end at a low single-digit rate. Europe certainly decelerated and came in at a low single-digit rate. I think in the spring I may have said that Europe may be a year behind the US, they’re catching up fast. It was very rocky as things decelerated there. And obviously a lot of companies have shared with you the so called emerging markets, by and large were still very strong, we were up double-digit with that group. September specifically was in line, slightly lower then July and August were. But I think we were pretty pleased with what we saw. I think where we see the weakness tends to correlate pretty well to the headlines, consumer soft, discretionary spending for big companies clearly getting more attention but we have a lot to be pleased with. We’re taking share at Leica, Radiometer, Fluke, water; all had very good quarters coming in with record backlog at Trojan. Don’t forget we’ve got a third of our mix now in consumables and after market. Didn’t have much of that, that’s 2X on a relative basis to what we had last time. I think we are navigating cautiously here as we end 2008 and get ready for 2009. But I feel very good about our ability to outperform in what may come here. 
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse : On M&A you mentioned there’s lots of attractive things out there, you’re well positioned to capitalize as you sit here and think about just the environment in general, do you feel like you’d be more inclined to wait just given the market environment rather then Danaher’s own liquidity situation given how much cash you have and fire power and as you step back and just think about the market, it is reasonable to think that you’ll step in now that we’ve seen prices fall off a cliff?
Dan Comas: As you know, as you can tell with our cash flow statement we’ve been pretty quiet the first nine months of the year and I would say that a number of assets, companies we were talking to those businesses have not traded and they’re by and large at lower prices today. And we don’t try to pick the bottom here but we’re obviously close to the bottom then we were six months ago and we feel very good about the opportunities right now. We have a fair amount of discussion going on. We’re obviously trying to make some judgments here on when bottom might be in some of these businesses but I think we feel very good about the balance sheet right now and I think you could expect us to be relatively active here.  Now whether it’s this quarter or 2009 time will tell, but we’ve done a lot to put the balance sheet in a position so we can be active here. 
Larry Culp: You’ll remember that back in 2001, 2002 we basically built out product ID with the Videojet acquisition and between [Veredore] and Gilbarco we’ve doubled up the size of the environmental business. I think history is a bit of guide or a lesson here for us as we think about the opportunities that should present themselves in the months and quarters to come. 
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse : On the pay as you go restructuring can you give us a sense in terms of just obviously you are always continuously DBSing everything and proactively restructuring the businesses, can you give us a sense of what that number has been that you’ve absorbed over the last couple of years?
Dan Comas: I’d say over the last four quarters we’ve averaged about $10 million a quarter, probably $35 to $40 over the last four quarters but I would say 2007 other then the fourth quarter that was a lower amount. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague - Citigroup
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: Is that using CP to take this bond out, what that kind of your normal transitional funding our are you making a proactive decision here to actually play CP a little more actively?
Dan Comas: No, I think was more a discrete event. It was $250 million bond; it was not a huge bond we were taking out. As well as the fact that we expect pretty strong cash flow here in Q4, so maybe sort of a timing issue where we could end up back a [sort] of sub $500 million CP levels, that’s not necessarily a goal, but that could happen by the end of the year. 
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: What is your appetite or thought about testing the market with longer term bond offering here if an acquisition materializes or should we think about smaller scale things where you would be using some transitional CP and cash flow?
Dan Comas: I think that being an A1/P1 commercial paper issuer is very important to us. Its always important but I think particularly in this environment so I think because of our cash flow, because of where we’re at ratios that [would] even suggest a rating probably a notch above where we are, I think we have a fair amount of latitude though it does suggest probably in the near-term something very large would be less likely. 
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: It sounds like great progress at TEK so you jump off 2008 with high teens margins can you give a sense of the confidence level there in a down revenue environment continue to take the margins up in 2009 to what degree is revenue an important part of the equation or is it still just a lot of heavy cost out and redundancy out that can take the margins up. 
Larry Culp: I think you’re right we are rather bullish on where we are with TEK; we’re about a month away from the one year anniversary. It’s been an excellent year. I think as we look at 2009 we’ve generated a lot of momentum here, yes it’s been kind of a flattish revenue year at TEK but I was very much in line with our expectations, obviously a number of good things going on, the emerging markets have been good high single-digit growers for TEK. I mentioned the new scope line, what we’re doing in network management. Clearly DBS has had a lot of impact. We’re probably up over 300 bps at the Op margin line this year. But I don’t think we’re any where close to being finished with respect to that cost structure. But that said, I think as we move forward clearly we’ve got a growth expectation unchanged from what we said when we bought this company. We think this is going to be a contributor, an adder to Danaher on a stand alone basis let alone in concert with Fluke where we continue to see and gain traction with the synergies. I think with everybody we’re going to be somewhat conservative as we think about revenues for 2009 so we’ll continue to push those growth programs but at the same time make sure that we’re using DBS to lean TEK to the extent possible and I feel that the team there has embraced DBS, has a year in place that we really can build on. 
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup: You called out cost, are you actually behind on price cost year-to-date so theoretically we have a narrowing of that negative spread or are you just thinking in aggregate obviously cost has downward pressure and therefore we just naturally get some help. 
Dan Comas: I think in the tool business price is definitely behind cost year-to-date. I wouldn’t say that for the other segments. We should get some relief here starting this quarter in commodities, the offset here is I think we’ll continue to see volume declines. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: One thing that hasn’t come up and you talked about distributors getting share but what’s you sense on the inventory levels through the system, do you sense as you walk through early October, end of September that there’s any panic in the system where people are starting to destock or the inventories were built up pretty aggressively ahead of price increases, anything that leads you to believe we might see some change there?
Larry Culp: I haven’t seen panic but I think in a number of instances we’ve got some well run distributor partners who are looking at all aspects of their business as they think about 2009 just as we are. So I don’t think we’ve seen anything radical take place but at the same time we want to make sure that we’re working with our distributor partners to set their inventory levels in the right way for what’s going to be a tough 2009. 
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: Given the wealth destruction at the consumer level, can you talk about dental mix, has your view changed as far as the cyclicality of this business at all from 2Q, are we really at risk here of seeing a big decline in that business?
Larry Culp: I think the business to the extent that it has that exposure to patient flow; those patients obviously are consumers has held up rather well. The bread and butter type procedures that result in products, our general products businesses be it restorative, be it endodontic and the like and that’s held in there pretty darn well. Clearly when you look back over 3.0, 40 years through a number of downturns, dental spending has continued to chug along and that’s US government data. I think a lot of people look to that as a foundation for being optimistic around the space and its ability to not swing wildly with the economy.  That said clearly on the KaVo side where we do sell some higher ticket items be it our 3D imaging systems or our operatory treatment units and the like I would not be surprised to see dentists be somewhat conservative relative to their capital spending and not only in the US but also in Europe in light of the uncertainty out there. I think in the US at year’s end we’ll be working against a very tough comp. I think the positive albeit a wildcard is the 179 incentive that will be out there and everyone I’ve talked to is still somewhat unclear but that’s really a short-term measure. I think as we look at the business that we’ve built out with Sybron those businesses KaVo and the related equipment business we are very pleased to have these businesses on board. Clearly Sybron has made great progress. We’ve got work to do at KaVo on the margins specifically. This business will outperform in its market as we go through this tougher period and be a very strong contributor Danaher for years to come. 
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: On the order patterns, I know in 2007 you had some big telecom orders, is that something, lumpiness there particularly in telecom, is that something that comes around every two, three years, is there some sort of pattern or was that a bit of a one-off?
Larry Culp: Clearly the win at Telstra is exciting for us but that is, in the network management business that I mentioned the orders may be big tickets but in essence or the revenue recognition is more of a steady Eddy type situation and that’s, we celebrate the Telstra win but we like the network management growth because it is not lumpy at the revenue level. That’s a business that was growing before and we’ve been able to go in and as we not only have improved the margins I think we’ve also been able to improve the quality, delivery, execution, at network management and free up some resources to continue to fund the growth potential the team continues to see there.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: On price, I don’t recall the Qs previously having all the detail on almost every segment you talked about, how much price you’re getting, but can you talk about the dynamic of, yes its great raw material costs are coming down, how quickly does this pretty positive front end inflation environment turn on you.
Dan Comas: I would say that if I could exclude tools for the moment our ability to get 1.5% to 2% price in our other businesses is largely driven by our consumable business and that tends to be less commodity and more of the ability to just kind of get that year on year. So I think we have done a much better job on price outside commodities outside tools and I think our ability to sustain that is much better then it’s been at any point in our history. I think we’ve just got better processes better approaches and better execution. I think within tools that is a risk where we will get less price however price has not been offsetting the significant rise we’ve seen here through August in commodity so we may get less price but I’ll take that in tools because we’re going to get some commodity benefit and are starting to see that. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: Can you talk outside of tools about on the commodity front how much that base is as a percentage of whatever sales or costs or even throw tools in there and then what you’re talking about, you have highlighted these commodity pressures pretty specifically so I’m wondering if you can put some metrics around that to help us better analyze the dynamics?
Dan Comas: I’d have to look at it and come back to you. 
Larry Culp: Outside of tools what has been the most insidious pressure that we faced hasn’t been in any single commodity per se but really in transport and logistics surcharges. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: That was my question, the base of what you’re talking about here.
Larry Culp: We’ll come back but it’s that T and L dynamic that has been most challenging and there will be a lag effect obviously from price per barrel to the surcharges but it’s by and large formulaic. We didn’t get much of that in the third, we’ll get a little bit in the fourth, but I think come the new year that should be a positive for us. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: You have always had pretty good insight into what’s going on in China, could you comment on what you’re seeing specifically in China, there’s a lot of debate around the economy there. 
Larry Culp: I’m headed over there in a couple of weeks so I’ll be more current then, but going through with the team a few days ago, I think the team had a good quarter across the board. They’re optimistic that they’re going to continue to perform but recognize even China is not immune to what’s happening globally and we may see a decell but at this point that’s really the team extrapolating from headlines as opposed to conversations with customers let alone order books. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Obviously you’re a different company to 2001, 202 have you done some work pro forma in that period in your [inaudible] portfolio and how the organic growth trended over that time given Danaher as it is now?
Dan Comas: I’m not sure I have the math in front of my but a period where we were down high single-digit, different mix if we kind of would layer in the med tech businesses that by and large were slower then they, mid single-digit but were still positive in an environment where we were down a number of our other peers were down double-digit, that number might have been low single-digit to flat. I don’t know you can ever say what’s a comparable environment but it would have been 500, 600, 700 basis points probably better core growth. 
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: If revenues do go negative next year which is, sounds like its possible, do you think you can still growth margins in that kind of environment and do you have any sense of how much margin you’ve lost in the last four or five years from negative price commodity inflation?
Larry Culp: We’d certainly be of the view that on a net basis we’ve been reducing material cost spend for like items. So while we’ve been dealing with metals and tools and some other pressures here and there we’ve also been accelerating our low cost region initiatives, sharpening our purchasing capabilities as well and that’s been helpful to us. How much on a gross basis, how much pressure we’ve seen, how much of that may be relieved here over a four, five year period we don’t have that for you this morning. 
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Do you think you can still grow margins next year if we have say a negative $0.02 revenue growth?
Larry Culp: Give us the time to get the businesses through budgets but clearly we are taking the actions that we’re announcing this morning as well as other activities to make sure we’ve got the best top and the best bottom line we possibly can deliver come next year. 
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: For 4Q, what FX rate are you baking in for 4Q?
Dan Comas: I think the euro if we used it as a proxy averaged about 145 a year ago, its 135, 136 today so that would be probably a negative 2%, 3% hit to revenues. That will be a headwind here in Q4.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: On your cash flows and use of cash flows just looking at your share authorization, at what point do you start finding the shares so attractive that you start buying your own shares relative to what’s happening in the broader market and potential acquisitions and then you haven’t made a large acquisition for a while which means that you do have a lot of fire power right now, so the scale of acquisitions that you’re looking at, do you have something that potentially could be significantly larger then the scale of Tektronix?
Dan Comas: On the buyback as you know we do not have a systematic buyback program. We tend to be opportunistic. At the end of every earnings period Larry and I and the team sit down, evaluate the situation and obviously maybe a little bit more opportunity today then in the past, but we do not for a variety of reasons foreshadow what we may or may not do in the open market.  Regarding acquisitions and potential size I think we will be very active in this environment. There is a lot of good small, medium sized bolt on adjacency type opportunities across med tech, test and measurement, product ID and water that I suspect our activities will be not unlike what it was during the last downturn. Not one very large opportunity but a series of small and medium sized opportunities that would build up our existing platforms. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: On the share buyback you still have an authorization there, are there any plans to expand that authorization and what drives the math on that decision? When you sit down after the quarter and you decide whether to do a share buyback or not is it more to do with opportunities out there or is more to do with acquisitions and other use of cash or is it more to do with the accretion that you’ll have if you actually buyback your own stock. 
Dan Comas: It’s a function of all of those but its largely a function of what we think our return on invested capital is on that buyback and again we will be sitting down here shortly to discuss that.  
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: As we’ve tracked through the September quarter the trends geographically but certainly in North America as well as the emerging markets seem to be relatively consistent where they were in the first half, it appears to me that obviously Europe has turned down fairly quickly, you mentioned it decelerated fairly quickly, has caught up to the US, is Europe the primary reason that we’ve accelerate the cost reduction efforts and then the strength in the dollar, it would appear it will be a minus 2% or 3% hit to revenue, that would at a conversion rate of 12%, that would look like maybe $0.04 of adjustment to the fourth quarter guidance due to currency?
Dan Comas: I did the math and came up with $0.03 in terms of year on year. 
Larry Culp: You’re right, Europe is decelerating here. We saw that through the summer, we saw that in September. But I think what we’re talking about this morning the ongoing restructuring activities is primarily a function of our macro call that there is great uncertainty, the risks clearly are at the downside and our balance here really has to be more weighted toward making sure the cost structures across the portfolio are in place to allow us to invest, to allow us to outperform in what could be a very tough economy here for awhile. I think Europe is one manifestation of that. The headlines and some of the early signs of the credit crisis that we’ve seen, is another representation. Maybe we’re wrong, maybe this will all pass, maybe the government’s activities here will make this a short-term event but I don’t think we do shareholders, we don’t do our team or our customers any favors by looking for the silver lining here because its an operating environment I don’t think any of us have ever been in. So we want to make sure we’re ready. And I intend to make sure we are very ready. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Larry Culp: Thank you for joining us today.

Operator:  Welcome to the Danaher Corporation second quarter 2008 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Andy Wilson: On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to point out that our earnings release, Form 10-Q, a slide presentation supplementing today’s call and reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G stating non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on our Investor section of our website at danaher.com, under the heading earnings. It will remain available following the call. In addition the audio portion of the call will be archived on the Investor section of our website later today and will remain achieved until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until July 22. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the U.S. and 719-457-0820 internationally, with a confirmation code of 497-9941. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for late arrivals. During the presentation we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impact the year-over-year performance. Please refer the accompanying slide presentation and other related presentation materials supplementing today’s call as well as the MD&A section of our second quarter Form 10-Q for details regarding additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Also, all references in the presentation to earnings, revenues and other specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher’s business unless otherwise noted. Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in our earnings are certain non-cash charges related to Tektronix acquisition for fair value adjustments, to recorded inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced total net earnings by approximately $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the second quarter and approximately $29 million or $0.09 per diluted share of the first half.  These charges are included in our reported results for the second quarter and the first half of 2008, but excluded from the adjusted earnings per share guidance that we will provide at the end of the prepared remarks. The amount of these non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition was expected to reduce our earnings by approximately $0.13 per share for the full-year of 2008. Throughout the call all references to non-cash acquisition-related charges for Tektronix relate to these items. I’d also like you to note that we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward-looking statements. With that I’d like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: We are pleased to report that our second quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.09, representing another record second quarter for Danaher and 14.5% increase over last year. Included in the second quarter earnings per share was approximately $0.03 per share of non-cash acquisition related charges for Textronix, as well as the benefit of approximately $0.03 per share related to just pre-tax items and another tax related benefits.
 : Year-to-date revenues increased 22.5% to $6.3 billion as core revenues grew 4%. Year-over-year gross margin for the second quarter improved approximately 190 basis points to 47.5% primarily due to the impact of higher gross margins in our new businesses and improved mix of revenues from existing businesses as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses were 26.2% of sales, compared to 24.4% a year ago due primarily to higher SG&A levels in our new businesses. Research and development spending as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 27 was 5.8% as compared to 4.9% last year. This increase was largely due to the impact of newer businesses with higher R&D levels primarily Tektronix, but also because of increased investment levels in our Med Tech businesses.
 : Operating margins in the second quarter was 15.5%, a 130 basis point decrease from 2007. The impact of newer businesses including the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix negatively impacted margins by approximately 65 basis points. Also impacting year-over-year margin comparisons were prior year one-time gains of approximately 50 basis points. Adjusting for these items operating margin was down 15 basis points in the second quarter compared to the prior year.  Our operating margin has been impacted by both inflationary pressures and by the effective of currency changes. In addition included in these results are the impact of approximately 50 basis points from our continuing restructuring spending and the settlement of certain legal claims. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 24% which benefited from the impact of certain discreet tax items as well as a slightly lower effective tax rate. We expect our effective tax rate for the balance of the year to be approximately 26%.  Net earnings were $363 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to net earnings in the second quarter of last year. For the first half net earnings were a record $640, an increase of 14.5% over last year. Included in net earnings are non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Adjusted net earnings for the second and first half improved 22% and 28% respectively over adjusted net earnings from last year.  Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2008 was $915 million, 33% higher than the same period last year. Second quarter free cash flow was $537 million, an increase of 65% over the same period last year and represents a record quarterly free cash flow performance. Improvements in working capital from first quarter levels primarily related to receivables collections, contributed to this record performance.  Free cash flow for the first half was $831 million representing a 34.5% increase over last year. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 148% for the second quarter and 130% for the first six months. We continued to be optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what we would be our 17th year in a row. During the quarter we reduced our outstanding debt by over $400 million and over $650 million from the first six months. Our debt total capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 23% with over $280 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarters end. Turning to our operating segments, professional instrumentation revenues increased 52.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 4%. For the first half of 2008 revenues increased 54% with core revenues contributing 4.5%. Operating margin for the 2008 second quarter was 20.1% as compared to 23.2% in the prior year. It’s the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions in the non-cash acquisition related charges for Textronix, negatively impacted margins by more than 300 basis points. Year-to-date operating margin decreased 300 basis points to 18.4% when compared to 2007 due principally to these same factors.  Environmental platform revenues grew 23.5% with core revenues up 6%. For the six months ended June 27, sales increased 24% with core revenues contributing 6.5%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low double-digit rate in the second quarter. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth at Hach-Lange. We continue to see solid demand for both our process and lab products with particular strength in Europe as well as in Asia where we experienced sales growth of more than 20%.  During the quarter we launched our new total organic carbon analyzer, the ANATEL PAT700 which provides advanced analytics in digital communications for pharmaceutical manufactures. It enables certain water analysis to be moved from the lab bench to the plant in an online mode charging new delivered mid-teens core revenue growth for the quarter reflecting significant demand for our wastewater solutions in both Europe and in China.  During the quarter Orange County California was awarded the 2008 Stockholm Industry Water Award recognizing the County’s efforts to develop the world’s largest water purification plant for ground water replacement. A key to the success of this project was the incorporation of Trojan’s World Class UV Disinfection Technologies. ChemTreat achieved mid-single digit revenue growth in the quarter.  During the quarter the company won several large industrial contracts and expanded its international sales initiatives, leveraging the Water Quality groups existing sales infrastructure. We look forward to sharing more about our Water Quality businesses at our mid-year analyst and investor meeting slated for September 3 in Loveland, Colorado. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter has increased sales of our environmental and payment products and overall strengthened most emerging markets were partially offset by soft dispenser sales in Europe and North America.  During the quarter we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Autotank Group based in Finland. With approximately $80 million of annual revenues we expect the acquisition of Autotank to help Gilbarco’s footprint in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia by providing payment systems, installation and maintenance service to our customers there. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close during the third quarter.  Moving to Test & Measurement, revenues grew approximately 100% in both the quarter and in the first half with core revenue contributing one half of 1% during the quarter and contributing at a low single-digit rate for the first half. Fluke core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter led by demand for our new low cost thermography products, the Ti-10 and the Ti-25. Geographically, we experienced growth across all major regions with particular strength in Latin America and Asia.  Fluke network sale were down low double-digits during the quarter resulting from softer sales to and through the major telecom providers in addition to a difficult comparison due to a large project a year ago. We expect the FNET results to improve sequentially over the balance of the year, but to remain challenging. At Tektronix revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, which is consistent with our expectations. We experienced double-digit sales growth in several product lines including certain scope in video test categories, as well as in network management where core revenue growth was driven by large customer wins in Asia and strength amongst our U.S. carrier base. This growth was offset by difficult year-over-year comparisons due to a very significant prior year shipment to a single customer, as well as softness in our network diagnostics business.  The launch of our new DPO3000 digit Oscilloscopes, which is used in designing, testing and ensuring quality control of electronic products is going exceptionally well with strong order performance and excellent customer awareness globally. The collaboration among TEK and Fluke associates is progressing extremely well. In emerging markets the teams have been working together leveraging combined resources to expand our sales presence in these important and rapidly growing regions. We’ve also seen strong support from a number of our large U.S. distributive partners including doing sales and marketing promotion for the Fluke and TEK basket of products.  We’re quite pleased with the company’s high teens operating margin performance in the first half of 2008, excluding of course the non-cash acquisition related charges. While still early, this is a substantial improvement versus the same period a year ago. It is a testament to both the quality and commitment of the Textronix’s team and their embrace of DBS. Moving to Medical Technologies, revenues for quarter increased 18.5% compared to 2007 and core revenues we’re up 10% with Radiometer, Lika and Dental all delivering strong performances. For the first half revenues increased 15% with core revenues up 6.5%. Med Tech operating margin for the second quarter was 10.8% compared to 11.1% a year ago due primarily to the impact of lower operating margins from our newer businesses; the negative effect of currency changes given our largely European cost base in Med Tech as well as restructuring and increased investments in both new products and go-to-market activities.  The operating margin for the first six months decreased 70 basis points to 11.1% as compared to the first six months of last year, a result of these same factors. Core revenues in our dental businesses improved sequentially and grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Sybron grew at a mid-single digit rate let by a strong performance from several new product introductions and solid general and administrative consumable sales. Our newly launched Twisted File is designed to meet Danaher’s needs by making rotary root canal preparation safer and more predictable resulting in a higher lever of doctor and patient satisfaction. We continue to see some pockets of softness during the quarter, particularly in Orthodontists although this portion of the business still grew at a modest rate.  At KaVo, we experienced robust demand for our 3D imaging product in both Europe and North America. With the new Gendex CB-500 medium field of view 3D combing imaging product has been very well received. Our first quarter initiative related to our Asian distribution channel continued to gain traction and we believe these changes will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our position in this fast growing part of the world. During the quarter, KaVo completed the acquisition of Infrared Fiber Systems, a small producer of optical fibers for laser power transmission in dental applications including hard tissue lasers. Radiometer’s core revenues grew at a higher single-digit rate for the quarter, driven primarily by strong consumable sales across all major geographies with particular strength in Russia, where we experienced double-digit growth. The rollout of AQT in Europe is progressing with positive reactions from the market. Like our core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, not withstanding the mid-teens performance a year ago, driven by robust compound microscopy demand, as well as more than 20% growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostics instruments and consumables business.  We experienced growth across all major geographies with particular strength in Asia and Europe. During the quarter Leica acquired core-tax small manufacturer of pathology instruments and consumables. We expect core TEK will enhance our ability to deliver end-to-end workflow solutions for our customers at Leica’s Biosystems.  Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 9.5% in the segment for the quarter with core revenues up 4%. For the first half, revenues increased 6.5% with core revenues contributing 1%. Operating margin for the second quarter was 17.1%, a 160 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due primarily to a prior year gain on indemnity proceeds from the litigation matter, which impacted margins by approximately 155 basis points as the lowest restructuring charges incurred in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter restructuring activities eliminated more than 150 positions in the segment.  Year-to-date operating margins decreased 120 basis points to 16% largely due to the same factors. Product ID core revenues increased 1% during the quarter. There’s a delay in certain large parcel projects and a reduction in traditional USPs projects at Accu-Sort’s partially offset low single-digit growth in the core marketing and coating side of the business. For the first six months sales increased 5% with core revenues declining slightly.  In Videojet growth and consumables in our laser and thermal transfer over printer product lines was partially offset by softer demand for our continues inkjet product offering as customers anticipate the upcoming launch of our new continuous inkjet 1510 high volume coating printer. The 1510 will consolidate six existing CIJ platforms into one and is expected to provide customers with industry leading up time and improved maintenance requirements. Switching to motion, revenues were up 9.5% in the quarter with core revenues contributing 3%. Growth in our aerospace and defense, flat panel display and elevator businesses was partially offset by softening demand in the U.S. and Europe for our standard motor and drive products. For the first half, sales increased 5.5% with core revenues down slightly. We are encouraged by the improved performance at Motion and expect the third quarter performance to be comparable or slightly better than the second quarter results. Finally, moving to Tools and Components, revenue for the quarter was up 4%, with core revenues contributing 3.5% primarily driven by the strong performance Jacobs Vehicle Systems. For the first half revenues were up 1.5% with the core revenue contributing 1%. The operating margin for the quarter was 13%, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year largely due to increased commodity costs, primarily steel and the impact of lower production levels within mechanic’s hand tools. Year-to-date the operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 12.4% due principally to these same factors. Mechanic’s hand tool revenues declined 2% in the quarter. Asada’s double-digit growth in China was offset by weakness in both professional and consumer businesses in the U.S. Our sell-through at lows was positive in the quarter while customer demand in Sears remained soft. For the first half Mechanic’s hand tools core revenues declined to 4%. During the quarter we announced an agreement with advanced auto parts to supply their stores with the full complement of our gear ranch brand of tools with revenues starting in the second half of this year. We’ve also received the contract to supply general mechanic’s tools kits to the U.S. army over the next five years, with a contract valued at approximately $100 million which represents the largest government contract win ever by the tool group. We expect shipments to begin later this year. So to wrap up, we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Record revenues including a solid core growth performance, record earnings and strong pre-cash flow and while we are keenly aware of the impact of higher commodity prices and the difficult credit markets are having on consumer consumption, in the economy as a whole we remain encouraged by what we see across the majority of our businesses.  In those businesses, where we’ve seen top-line softness, we have taken action in implementing cost initiatives to protect the bottom-line. In those businesses where we have opportunities to invest in growth, we’ve continued to make those investments. As always our focus is on delivering strong financial results regardless of the economic environment. As a results our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the third quarter is estimated to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.14, which excludes the non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition. We are raising our full-year 2008 adjusted earnings per share guidance from $4.30 to $4.40 to a new range of $4.34 to $4.42, which excludes both the acquisition charges related to Tektronix and the benefit of the $0.03 per share of discrete tax items realized in the second quarter. Thank you, everybody that concludes our formal remarks. Nicky I think we are now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Inch - Merrill Lynch. 
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Hey, so margins under a little bit of pressure. I mean the top-line was great, margins under a little bit of pressure in terms of the sequential year-over-year trend, could you guys talk about how much of that kind of overall was raw material pressures and how much restructuring actually incurred in the quarter and what the results would have been after that?
Larry Culp:
 :
 :
 : So, it’s clearly a tougher environment and probably a stage challenging in that regard, but I think we know what we need to do here as we look forward to the third quarter and the second half.
Dan Comas : So John, I mean in total absent restructuring in the one-time items we referenced that hit us by roughly 50 basis points, our operating margins would have been up 35 basis points across the company.   
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: And what’s restructuring Dan I think you did about $10 million in the first quarter. It was a…
Dan Comas : 50 basis points is approximately $15 million in the quarter, the large majority of that was restructuring. There’s a little bit of kind of some settlement of some legal claim.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Okay, so just to switch gears here. I guess Photon Dynamics, one of your big customers when motion was acquired; is that going to affect your outlook for that business in anyway do you think?
Larry Culp:  John, I think the over tech transaction with Photon is something we need to sort through it. We know them from our servertronics business in each real of course, but it’s really too early to tell.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers.  
Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers: A couple of questions; first of all, Tektronix and Fluke, the organic growth at Tektronix was off a little bit. I mean there was -- I think they’ve been running ahead of what you thought so far at the beginning of the year and this is off, maybe you could talk a little bit about why that was and then just maybe give a little more detail about the integration and where they are getting -- whether the integration is a net disruption or a net positive thing. You talked about the distributors and so forth and so on, but maybe some more color around the organic growth and the integration?
Larry Culp: 
 : I think, what we have seen thus far is the business is everything we thought it would be from a brand, from a technology, from the global reach perspective. I was with the team last month in Japan in fact and walked away I think very encouraged by what we are doing there. Really the team around the world is just tremendous people. I think the synergies that we see clearly are there both with respective to revenue and cost. We’ve talked about the cost progress this year where. We are well ahead of $40 million a year one reduction that goes well for ’09 of course.  I continue to believe that there are opportunities from a product and from a channel perspective for Fluke and TEK to work together, and I think we’re going to help them to be frankly more aggressive and more competitive in the marketplace. So, I think all-in-all we are, where we thought we would be feeling very good about the addition of Tektronix and looking forward to many good years ahead.
Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Yeah, that’s question one. Question number two is, if you don’t mind is there’s a lot of chatter all this year about possible, optional dental procedures you mentioned that briefly with the orthodontics comment and maybe you could remind us you mean how much of the dental business could be considered high-end deferrable and so how is that doing? What’s the outlook?
Larry Culp:  Well the highest end into our business will really be the ortho or the Ormco business, where we saw a deceleration of the core growth trends there, but we were still nicely positive. I think it’s been pretty well documented in the U.S. that their ortho starts have softened a bit here, but I think the other thing to keep in mind is why that is taking place is doctor’s transition, case starts in patients to our self ligating technology. We get a very positive mixed benefit there, which is why we were able to show the growth that we did at Ormco despite the softness in case starts. 
 :
Operator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: 
 :
Larry Culp: I don’t think that’s a data point that we’re going to talk to on an ongoing basis, Deane. I think we talked to that. I think to put the first quarter shipment number in context that you see that reading through as we get anticipated hear in the second quarter, but since you are asking we were -- orders were up in the mid-single digit rate in the second quarter.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: That would indicate sort of a nice trend line there as well. So copying about the balance of the year for core revenue growth?
Larry Culp: Yes, I think we are really pleased with the second quarter performance. I think particularly when you look at the way all four segments contributed this time around we had -- I think there was a minimum of 3.5%, as you look across the four segments. Clearly water and Leica did it again. The water growth as we mentioned in the prepared remarks is very broad based. All three legacy of Med Tech really performed I think quite well. 
 : I think as we look into third quarter, particularly we would expect to see all our four segments in a mid single-digit zone clearly the high flyers Water and Leica are likely to de-sail off those double-digit growth rates, but still perform well. I think we’ll see tools and motion incrementally get better as we head it -- I think flag through the second quarter.  Mid Tech should be in the mid, maybe high single digit range. I think it’s whole 179 incentive in dental equipment around KaVo is a bit of a Wild Card. It should be a net positive for us, but what that does for us in third quarter versus fourth is a little unclear right now and particularly with respect to order books, Gilbarco built a fair bit of backlog in the second quarter, which should board well for them here in the third.  So all-in-all I think we would expect the second half inline with the first half obviously mindful of the risks that are out there and that’s why you see it’s taking the cost actions as well as just to make sure we protect in the event things get sloppier.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment Research:  On the telecom side Larry, can you give us a little color in terms of what you are seeing in terms spending priorities? As you noted maybe not too much different than what you thought, but just the complexion of demand here the next couple of quarters?
Larry Culp:  Yes, I think what we are -- when we talk about it in a Fluke network context, we’re really talking about a big project, with respect to network optimization that we will repeat this year. At that main into the technician level, what we are seeing is clearly a tightening of the bell and in turn lower spending levels for those tools that go on those belts amongst the maintenance text out in the field.  I think over at Tektronix, specifically Tech communications clearly seeing the carriers spend money broadly in network management and optimization, that’s the core business of what we do at Tech and that’s the business if it’s up double-digit, we call that network management and we state networks again those are really the carriers not the enterprise customers, that we serve at FNET.  The other bit of the business that has been weaker is really what we call network diagnostics Jeff and that’s what we are working with the equipment manufacturers, which is I think you know have been soft for a while and I think we will continue to be soft as we look through the balance of this year. 
Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment Research: And now Larry, this is a solid separate follow-up on the deal side can you give us -- you raveled off a couple of deals, most of them sound small expect for the one in GVR, but what where the acquired revenues in the quarter, on the go forward basis and what does the pipeline look alike?.
Larry Culp: A little over $100 million Jeff, acquired revenues most of that being leads and other pending order pegs.
Dan Comas :
 : To finish that 200 million with Autotank, a little over 100 million on the three other deals. Sorry.
Larry Culp:
 :
Operator : Our next question is from Wendy Caplan with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that in product ID that there were some order delays, was this exclusively related to the customers waiting for the new product? Were there any other issues, are you seeing other order delays anywhere else and can you comment on product ID share please?
Larry Culp: Good morning Wendy. The delays that we referenced in product ID were specific to Accu-Sort and again the customer base there, U.S. Postal Service and some of prominent global parcel delivery folks, we saw from projects slip in the first quarter and intern they have continued to slip. I think you have seen some of those companies talk about rating and capital spending this year as their volumes have declined. We’ve certainly been on the receiving end of that. I would really contrast that with what we have seen in Videojet and that’s where the new product reference is relevant.  We have a new printer coming in as part of our platform consolidation effort there, not only with Videojet but some of the other acquisitions. I think we probably had some, I’ll call it modest negative effect from the pending launches. People, who know about this product and know that it’s coming and are excited about it, held off on some purchases, but the core business there I think is performing pretty well, no signs amongst that customer base of capital reductions or delay, but obviously in that business like in many of our businesses, we are watching carefully the trends.
Dan Comas : And Wendy, this is a reminder an Accu-Sort, it is a low -- particularly that project business is at low margin. We are currently forecasting that piece to be down double-digit in Q3 that could be a year-on-year reduction of over $5 million of revenues, but the operating profit about $5 million is less than $500,000. So, we’re not happy about the revenue picture there, but it’s not having much of a profit impact.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Thanks, and just the last part of the question was about market share in product ID, and as well are there any other areas of the company that you’re seeing any kind of project delays related to customer spending?
Larry Culp: I think our share in product ID, particularly around Videojet continues to be strong. We have a number of good competitors there, but it’s a good market and I think we do well and I surely look forward to getting the 15, 10 out and the products that come behind it.  As we look across the business given what we saw to Dean’s question with respect to order flow and the like really nothing of it is pronounced Wendy as it is in at Accu-Sort with respect to big customer’s clearly delaying programs. Certainly, you’ve heard us talk about a couple of businesses, where certain product lines are seeing soft demand, GVR being another example, but I think that really is a simply well correlated to the headlines out there today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
Richard Eastman - Robert Baird: Just a quick comment if you will; across platforms and businesses, what’s your perspective on the kind of developing dynamics in Europe, Larry? I mean are things turning down as quickly as some of the data point suggest and are you seeing that specifically in any portions of the business?
Larry Culp: Rick I think if you look at our Danaher-wide European performance in the second quarter, it was fundamentally inline with what we saw in the first quarter. Obviously there’s some noise there with the Easter timing in ’08 compared to ’07. 
 : We’re simply looking at our second quarter figures, but we operate with a little bit more -- with a different mind set. So we’re going to take nothing for granted over there right now.
Dan Comas : And Rick, one thing that’s helped core in Q2 was very strong performance in Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey. We actually saw an acceleration in those regions from Q1. 
Richard Eastman - Robert Baird: Okay, alright and then just is a, may be a follow up. Larry, in terms of the Gilbarco business, are you treating the downturn as structural or cyclical?
Larry Culp: Well, I think it’s a mixed bag there Rick I wouldn’t want to characterize it as structural because we saw excellent growth in our environmental products both our air and water quality products there. Retailers continue to invest in security and payment systems, so we actually saw I think very good growth in the quarter. Despite more that’s getting pinched the way they have been really around the world.  You clearly see the softness with dispensers but to the extent that these stations continue to operate, people are going to continue to use gasoline; people are going to sell gasoline. We think that’s an opportunity to be a provider of choice. So I think this is more -- the approaches is probably somewhere between in that we’re going hard after cost not only here in the North American operations but really around the world. 
Operator: And our next question is from Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: A couple of quick questions; the first one is just looking at the amount of your net debt going down to about $500 million, could you give us some color as to how much you have available right now with your creditor facilities that are already opened to be able to finance acquisitions right now?
Larry Culp: Ajit just in terms of the existing facility it would be the approximate $1.5 billion today and I think we would be able to access more because giving existing lines.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: And the pipeline of acquisition, you said that the pace and interest of folks that you are speaking with hasn’t gone down, it’s been fairly steady, but could you give us some indication as to the nature, not necessarily the industry, but the rough size of potential acquisition that you are the closest to?
Larry Culp: Well, I think that the pipeline is shaped as it often is by a large number of smaller transactions and possible transactions, a healthy but smaller number of if you will midsized transactions, a $100 million or $200 million to $300 million and then the smallest piece of the pipeline is the that the Tektronix type transactions of companies north of $500 million in revenue.  So, there’s really no change there and I would expect this year to play out more of less the way we’d seen it over the last several years. Though we never plan it that way, we do a dozen transactions, tends to be one large transaction, two, three, four midsized transactions and the rest the smaller built-on that provides important technology or distribution access.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Right and when you’re looking at the sort of tightening credit markets out there, are you seeing a greater willingness to speak with strategic buyers like, your selves and of the valuation have you seen any material change in the potential acquisitions, expected evaluations?
Dan Comas : I think Ajit the tightening credit market has definitely helped the number of conversations. In terms of valuation, I would say that valuations offset, our trailing numbers are coming in, they are coming down. Of course the challenge is to sort figure out what the next year or two is going to look like, but I would say Ajit, I would say that we’d seen improvement in the sort of value on the valuation side.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Tusa, with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tusa – JP Morgan: Tektronix, what was the revenue that that contributes like $350 million bucks, is that right?
Larry Culp: It’s probably more than 200 to 300.
Stephen Tusa – JP Morgan: 200 to 300, so what was the …
Dan Comas : More than 200 to 300.
Stephen Tusa – JP Morgan: And then so the profit contribution from that?
Dan Comas : Well, on a segment basis, on a business un it basis we said high teen, so again we’ve got, the non-cash origins, we’ve got a fair amount of amortization on that as well.
Stephen Tusa – JP Morgan: Okay. So is there a seasonality to that business or anything like that or that seems like a pretty high margin?
Larry Culp: Well, that’s what we’re working towards in lead. 
Dan Comas : There was some benefit given that May was at their year-end but the margin we generated in Q2 was better than Q1, but not meaningfully better. So, I think we’ve got pretty good traction there.
Operator: And due to time restrains our final question comes from Mr. Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: So I missed this; you’ve already said this, but restructuring obviously you’ve taken some expenses in the last three quarters, anything in the second half of the year within guidance?
Larry Culp: Yes and we currently have a comparable to slightly lower amount planned right now for the third quarter and we are all looking at other activity thoughts for Q3 and the fourth quarter.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Okay and is that within industrial again.
Larry Culp: That’s in industrial, it’s also some in professional instrumentation part of that Fluke network.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Secondly on free cash, I think you said in the past roughly $5 per share of free cash. You had a great quarter of free cash for the last quarter. I mean does that increase or do we get a little pullback in the second half of the year.
Larry Culp: I mean obviously it’s a very good quarter. We did benefit a little bit from the timing of tax payments, but remember you’ve quoted it’ll work out to a little bit under $1.7 billion. I think the street numbers we have seen are $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. I think we’re based on what we know comfortable with the high-end of that.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: And then finally on the tax rates, it’s coming in a little bit lower in the second half of the year. It looks like that’s a mix of, profits overseas this U.S. is that right and if so what do you think is seen at that kind of level?
Larry Culp: Well I think given the current tax law that’s sustainable that we are feeling the change in tax laws in different jurisdictions, but right now we are comfortable with it.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank: Right and then maybe just one more; obviously you’ve done a great job with the Textronix’s margins; have you thought to attack the R&D base of that business yet because obviously R&D’s in the team. Is that to come?
Larry Culp: Well I would use different language there Nigel. I think that the R&D group there is exceptionally talented. We want to make sure that we have those folks working on the right programs and driving that sort of shift in focus and accelerating the impact are they going to have on the top line. It’s really where a lot of our energies are in right now.  I think that this changes you put in this reference out there have impacted all functions not only some of the back office operations, but really across the board but we’re trying to being smart about it, because that engineering group is the really the heart and soul of what has made TEK strong and we want to build on that strength as we go forward. 
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session.

Operator:  I’d like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation 2008 first quarter earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Wilson, you may begin your conference.
Andy Wilson : Thanks Melissa. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to point out that our earnings release and 10-Q are available in the investor section of our website, Danaher.com, under the heading earnings. Access to a slide presentation supplementing today’s call can also be found on the Danaher website under the same heading.  Both the audio of this call and the slide presentation will be archived on our website later today and will be available until the next quarterly call. In addition, a replay of this call will be available until April 21. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the U.S. and 719-457-0820 internationally. The confirmation code is 2384639. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for late arrivals. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted the year-over-year performance. Please refer to the accompanying webcast slide presentation and the MD&A section of our first quarter Form 10-Q for details regarding additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.  Also, all references in this presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher’s business unless otherwise noted. Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in Tektronix’s results are certain non-cash acquisition-related charges for the fair value adjustments to record inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced pre-tax earnings by $26 million and net earnings by $19 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in the quarter. Throughout the call all references to non-cash acquisition-related charges for Tektronix relate to these items.  In addition, the amount of these non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix for the full year 2008 are expected to reduce our earnings by approximately $0.13 per share. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the prepared remarks. I’d also like to note that in order to help you understand the company’s direction, we’ll be making some forward-looking statements during the call including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With respect to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call today, the accompanying information required by SEC Regulation G related to those measures can be found in the investor section of our website under the subheading earnings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that our first quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.83, representing another record first quarter for Danaher and an 8% increase over last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.89, a 15.5% increase over last year’s first quarter.  Revenues for the quarter increased 20% to a record $3 billion led by acquisitions, primarily Tektronix, which were up 13%; positive currency effects of 5%, with core revenue up 2%.  Strength in our Hach-Lange, Fluke, Leica, and Radiometer was offset by continued soft demand in several of our OEM and consumer-driven businesses primarily here in the U.S. We’ll comment in more detail in the segment review, but I’ll highlight here that we are encouraged by the current order growth trends we are seeing in many of our businesses. Order rates overall increased at a mid single-digit rate in the first quarter and we believe this bodes well for an improved core revenue performance in the second quarter. Year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter improved 160 basis points to 46.8%, primarily due to an improved mix of revenues from existing businesses as well as recently acquired businesses with higher gross margins. SG&A expenses were 27% of sales compared to 25.6% a year ago, due primarily to higher SG&A levels in our recent acquisitions.  Research and development spending as a percentage of sales for the quarter was 6.1%, as compared to 4.9% a year ago. This increase was primarily due to the impact of newer businesses with higher R&D levels, primarily Tektronix. Operating profit for the quarter was $413 million, which includes $26 million of non-cash acquisition-related charges for Tektronix. Adjusted operating profit was $493 million, a 19% increase over last year. Operating margin was 13.6%, a 110 basis point decline from 2007. The non-cash acquisition-related charges in connection with Tektronix as well as the impact of recently acquired businesses had a dilutive impact on the quarter’s operating margin. This dilution was partially offset by 15 basis points of operating margin improvement in existing businesses with particular strength in Professional Instrumentation. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 26.9% in the first quarter of ‘07. Net earnings were $277 million for the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $296 million, an increase of 17.5% compared to net earnings in the first quarter of last year.  Operating cash flows were $333 million, a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2007, despite the negative impact of approximately $20 million of cash restructuring expenditures at Tektronix. Working capital increases negatively impacted cash flow in the quarter, due primarily to higher inventory levels to support existing and anticipated order levels, as well as the slower collection of accounts receivable in Europe due in part to the timing of the Easter holiday. We expect our working capital performance to improve over the balance of this year. Free cash flow was $294 million for the three months ended March 28, 2008. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 106%. We anticipate that our conversion ratio will increase over the balance of the year as it did in 2007. As such, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our seventeenth year in a row. During the first quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by over $200 million. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 26.8% with over $230 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter’s end. Turning to our operating segments, Professional Instrumentation revenues increased 56% for the quarter with core revenues up 5.5%. The operating margin for the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 19.5% last year. Adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 130 basis points, driven by leverage from higher sales volumes in both our Water Quality and Test & Measurement businesses. Environmental revenues grew 25%, with core revenues up 7%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low double-digit rate in the first quarter, led by continued sales strength at Hach-Lange’s process and laboratory products throughout the U.S. and in Europe. Sales in Asia also grew at a rate over 20%, reflecting our continued focus on emerging market penetration. Trojan delivered double-digit core growth revenue for the quarter, reflecting significant demand in Europe and in North America. Bid activity remains robust. During the quarter, we delivered a multimillion-dollar wastewater project in Spain as well as two environmental contaminant treatment projects in Australia and in the U.S., all three of which contributed to the quarter’s outstanding growth. ChemTreat continues to perform well, achieving high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter compared to its results last year as a standalone company. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate for the quarter driven by strengthened environmental products in Asia and in North America as well as healthy point-of-sale demand in North America and payment system sales in Europe. During the quarter, ExxonMobil installed its thousandth Passport point-of sale system, contributing to this growth. This growth was largely offset by soft demand for dispensers, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe. Moving to Test and Measurement, revenues grew approximately 100% in the quarter with core revenue up 3%. Fluke core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate for the quarter. Double-digit growth in industrial products was led by healthy demand for our newly launched digital multimeters and a very strong performance from the Ti-10 and the Ti-25, our new lower cost thermography products which were aimed at broadening the handheld and portable thermography market. During the quarter, Fluke’s 8808 digital multimeter was awarded Test and Measurement World magazine’s Best in Test product award.  Fluke Networks sales were down during the quarter, as strength in copper and fiber products were offset by several large telecom projects that did not reoccur this year. Turning to Tektronix, we are very pleased with the results to-date. TEK experienced mid single-digit core growth during the quarter as compared to last year when it was a standalone company. As a result of the soft orders last year we do not anticipate this level of growth over the remainder of the year. Similar to some of our past acquisitions, this environment has helped to facilitate our integration activities which in short are going quite well. We expect to over deliver in 2008, which is our original target and believe the business will be well positioned for next year and beyond.  We have also just completed a strategic plan identifying a number of exciting opportunities many of which involved collaborative efforts with Fluke. But probably most encouraging to me at this point has been the Tektronix team’s embrace of DBS. Tektronix just received a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for its real-time transport stream monitoring product which provides capability for monitoring, measuring and ensuring quality around high-definition video transmission. Interestingly, this is the seventh Emmy awarded to Tektronix demonstrating their dedication to providing innovative technology to the film and television industry. Moving over to Medical Technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 11% compared to 2007. Its core revenues were up 3% led by a strong growth at Radiometer and Leica. Med Tech operating margins for the first quarter was 11.5% compared to 12.5% a year ago, primarily due to higher new product introduction costs at Radiometer for the AQT launch, the impact of soft revenues within the dental businesses and the effect of the strengthening euro, given that much of our cost base is in Europe. Core revenues in both our dental consumables and equipment businesses were flat in the quarter compared to 2007. In our consumables business, sales of our Damon self-ligating braces, grew at a double-digit rate but was offset by slightly weaker end markets and the impact of a very strong fourth quarter. We also saw a slowing of more expensive procedures which negatively impacted certain of Kerr’s high end restorative products. However, we believe the market continues to grow and we expect our dental consumables business to return to more traditional growth rates for the balance of this year. At KaVo we experienced robust demand for our 3D imaging and digital product lines as well as our Pelton & Crane treatment units, which grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Overall, we grew at a mid single-digit rate in the U.S. and in Europe, offset by a decline in Asia as we altered certain distribution channels during the quarter. We believe this change in distribution strategy, while negatively impacting the first quarter, will better position us for long-term growth in Asia. As we look to the balance of 2008, we believe the U.S. tax stimulus package will positively impact the second half of the year as accelerated depreciation incentives are expected to drive big ticket equipment purchases. During the quarter, we acquired Shirokusa Dental Supply Works, a leading dental distributor based in Osaka, Japan and the exclusive distributor of our KaVo products in Japan. Radiometer’s core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate for the quarter driven by strong consumable sales, a result of robust analyzer replacements in 2007. Sales growth was experienced across all major geographies. AQT, our new point-of-care offering used to detect cardiac markers is being well received in the market and we are ramping our sales and marketing investments to realize its full potential. Leica core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, notwithstanding a mid-teens growth rate a year ago driven by robust compound microscopy demand as well as double digit growth at Leica Biosystems. We experienced growth across all major geographies with particular strengths in Asia and in Europe. During the quarter, we acquired Bal-Tech, a developer and producer of specimen preparation instruments and consumables used both in pathology and research applications. Bal-Tech complements Leica’s current product portfolio and provides access to several new technologies and end user markets. Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 3% for the quarter with core revenue down 1.5%. Operating margins for the quarter were 14.8%, an 80 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year due in part to lower sales volumes, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.  These restructuring and cost reduction investments will continue in the second quarter and will help drive future segment profitability. The overall impact of these investments to first half operating margin will be approximately 80 basis points. Product Identification core revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Our core marking and coating business grew at a low single-digit rate, led by double-digit rate growth in thermal transfer overprint sales. Order rates improved sequentially in the quarter, a result of additional sales resources deployed here in the U.S.  Accu-Sort’s core revenues were down in the quarter, primarily due to customer-driven project delays. We are cautiously optimistic that these projects will be completed in the coming quarters. As we mentioned before, much of this project business comes with lower margins. During the quarter, we acquired Claricom, a developer of software used in network and design messages used in coding equipment. Both Videojet and Linx have successfully sold Claricom products with their printers for a number of years. The acquisition of Claricom increases our capabilities to provide flexible real-time management of our marking and coding systems to our customers. Switching to motion, revenues were up 2% in the quarter with core revenues down 4%. Growth in our aerospace and defense, flat panel and elevator businesses was offset by slowing demand in the U.S. and in Europe for standard motor and drive products. However, we are encouraged by order growth during the quarter, which increased at a double-digit rate year over year. Kollmorgen executed a new five-year preferred supply agreement with Otis to supply traction machines for its Gen2 machine room elevators as well as to develop and supply a new range of traction machines to be launched in 2009. Finally, moving to Tools and Components, revenue for the quarter was down 1.5%. Operating margin for the quarter was 11.7%, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior year due to volume increases at Jake Brake as well as the benefit of fourth quarter 2007 restructuring actions. Mechanic hand tool revenues declined 6% in the first quarter as double-digit growth in China was offset by domestic weakness in both professional and consumer lines. On a positive note, sell-through at Lowe’s in our category was up double-digits for the quarter, but customer demand at Sears remained soft. One quick note here, the repairs made as a result of the fire at our Shandong, China facility last quarter have been completed and that facility is up and running at capacity again. So to wrap up, let me say here that while we are pleased with our mid-teens earnings growth amidst the slowing in certain markets and the macroeconomic uncertainties in general, we are prepared as we look forward here to tackle both the challenges and the opportunities in 2008.  We anticipate that our strong performers will sustain their results and this, coupled with recent order trends elsewhere, will drive growth. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities were appropriate while taking real cost actions were needed. While it’s early, we are very encouraged with performance at Tektronix and we remain solidly on track there. As always, we remain focused on driving earnings and cash flow growth regardless of the economic environment. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second quarter is estimated to be in a range of $1.02 to $1.07 and we are reconfirming our full year 2008 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40.
Andy Wilson: Thanks, Larry. That concludes our prepared remarks. Melissa, we are now ready for questions.  
Operator:  We will go first to Steve Tusa - JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  A question on the comment around order rates. Could you expand on that a little bit, maybe put some numbers or just whether you’re taking about in March specifically? Can you just maybe provide some color on that comment?
Larry Culp:  Sure Steve. I think if we look at the quarter, what we’re really suggesting here is that we saw mid single-digit order growth in the quarter. We had, as you look at the four segments, in fact the order growth rate exceeded the shipment growth rate in all four segments. So that dynamic was broad based, I would say it was particularly pronounced in March as we saw a sequential acceleration in a number of places. So, on balance I think we look at that relative to the second quarter and perhaps the prospects for the rest of the year, it’s one of the encouraging data points we take from the first quarter.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  How much of your business is book and ship? I mean what’s the lead time on that kind of stuff?
Larry Culp:  Well it’s going to vary. Obviously as we’ve built a backlog during the first quarter we were seeing some of our short cycle time customers simply lay in orders for second quarter delivery, in some cases third quarter delivery; extended lead times or requested lead times on their part much more so than for us, there were also a couple of places where we didn’t get product out that we could have and obviously have already here in early April.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  Right. So, the bottom line is with the order rates the way they are you would expect an acceleration in core growth in the second quarter?
Larry Culp:  I think that’s exactly right, Steve. That’s my expectation. We can talk a little bit more about the first quarter, but as we look ahead, I would expect three of our four segments to show accelerated core growth on a sequential basis. I think there could be a slowing in Professional Instrumentation because of the dynamics at Gilbarco Veeder-Root right now where we sell to retailers and obviously they’re getting pinched both with the consumer and with fuel margins.  But I think when you look at Med Tech right now, dental was the drag there. I think dental gets better; certainly the Sybron dynamics get better there. I think the Asian distribution issues on the KaVo side work themselves out and we have a number of exciting new product introductions both at KaVo and at Sybron coming in the quarter. At Industrial Tech, we’ve gotten pushed a bit at Accu-Sort around some retail and some parcel post programs. They’re currently dialed in the second quarter, but I think we’ll be cautious there, but again I think on balance we should see acceleration there.  And obviously in Motion, we get at a minimum the benefit of the easier comps.  I think in Tools and Components, we’ve been dealing with a tough environment here for almost a year. So again while we’re not expecting any miracles from the U.S. consumer, I think the easier comps themselves help what we’ll turn in for the second quarter on the organic growth side.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  Right, and one last quick one. Any restructuring you guys did in the fourth quarter to get out ahead of some economic weakness perhaps, anything in the first quarter?
Larry Culp:  Steve, you bet. What we did, I mean, this is unusual for us because as you know I think we tend to do a lot of our restructuring in the second half and in the fourth quarter, but I think given the environment that we are in we accelerated a number of actions. You look in the first quarter we probably put $10 million into restructuring activities principally in Motion, a little bit in Product ID, a little bit in Tools so that comes out of the profitability here in the first quarter. I think you ought to expect us to do the same thing here in the second quarter. We’ve got a number of programs laid in so we’re talking about a handful of facilities, several hundred folks that we’re going to say goodbye to, but I think those are the prudent actions that we’re going to take even though it will suppress our operating margins a bit here in the short term, those are the right things to make sure we’ve got a cost structure calibrated with reality in a more uncertain environment.
Operator:  We’ll go next to Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs:  Thank you, good morning, everyone. The first question is in Medical could you quantify what that change in the distribution channel in Asia, how that affected the quarter and how long-lasting might that effect be? 
Dan Comas:  Deane, it primarily impacted dental equipment. Outside of Asia in U.S., Europe, Latin America, our dental equipment business was up mid single-digit. In Asia we were down close to 50% as we changed out distribution in China. During the quarter we acquired our distributor in Japan. We’ve changed our large distributor in China who we were quite unhappy with, with a number of more regional players, and while we don’t expect a lot of year-on-year growth in Asia in Q2 we don’t expect any sort of significant decline that we saw in Q1. So if the rest of Dental Equipment continues to perform the way it did in the first quarter, we would expect a nice sequential improvement in core growth here in Dental Equipment.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs:  So, there’s less of a carryover into the second quarter on Asia Pacific?
Dan Comas:  We’ve changed out the distribution in the case of Japan. We now have control of the distribution, and we would expect that we’d see an improved performance here in the second quarter.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs:  Then over on Tektronix, Larry, it was interesting you used the term that’s usually our line about over delivering, but it’s nice to hear that the integration is going well, but could you give us the next layer of detail? I’d be very interested, as it applies to DBS? How much of DBS is going into the pure manufacturing equation at Tektronix, which was already operating it at healthy margins? Also, what about R&D? It’s a big chunk of their expense. Is there a DBS opportunity in how they spend on R&D?
Larry Culp:  Deane, a couple of things. Let me try to tackle all of that. I think with where we are today, I would say we are very pleased with the short-term performance in the business, and I would say we are very confident about the long-term potential there. Clearly when you look at the first quarter very solid top-line performance, core growth, mid single-digits, better profit performance than we had anticipated. I would say it’s very early. The DBS efforts have taken some root there. This is an organization that was quite comfortable with Lean. I think we’re sharpening the point on a number of actions in that regard. Clearly, we get a benefit from the consolidated purchasing activities, which have moved forward at a breakneck pace, so very pleased in that regard. I think, as we look at the full year, we will as we indicated in the prepared remarks, do a little bit better on the profit side. We did not expect this a year ago to be a big growth year for them. Clearly, you heard them talk about some issues that they were having in Japan and the network diagnostics. That’ll be something we wrestle with during the course of the year and obviously it’s a big transition as well, which will perhaps create a little bit of noise here and there.  But again, I think we’re ahead of the $40 million target on the cost reductions and feel very good about the way things are playing out this year. To your questions which I think are really more long-term and I can give you an update because we were just out there three weeks ago doing the strategy plan reviews. I think the strategic logic is very much intact. This is an outstanding company, great fit for us, clearly, a smart place for us to put money to work. I think we saw opportunities galore here, really many places for us to deploy DBS, Deane. You talked about R&D. I wouldn’t say that we are necessarily going to change the way they do R&D because I think they do an outstanding job. They’re probably one of our benchmarks already. But I think their focus on technology can be more tightly coupled with a focus on the customer, with a focus on applications. That’s something that we’re going to bring, which is very much a part of DBS as well, which I think will help them out.  I also think our operating model of pushing decisions to the point of impact is going to perhaps liberate the operations in Europe and throughout Asia that have probably been tightly tethered to Beaverton in a number of instances. The team’s all on board on this, it’s the way we operate, I have shown this to the tech team, they get it, they’re excited about it and I think this will just make us a quicker, more market-focused organization.  The strat plan unveiled a number of additional details about the Fluke and Fluke Network synergies in terms of products and go-to-market, more to come there as have something to show for that. So, all in all, I think DBS will have a lot of impact, but it’s an outstanding company to start with and we’re excited about what will happen this year and in the future.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs:  Terrific. Just to your point about the synergies, has that changed? I mean is that additive to your assumption at $40 million? Are there revenue synergies between Tektronix and FNET that look a little more attractive than they did previously?
Larry Culp:  Yes, but we’re not going to really count the revenue synergies to overdrive the targets this year. That will all be on the cost side.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers.
Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers:  Back on the current organic growth and outlook in Motion, for example, I was a little surprised when you say aerospace, defense, flat panel was good but the standard product was soft and then mentioned the orders were double-digit. I mean, why were the standard products soft in the first quarter? It is surprising.
Larry Culp:  I don’t disagree, Bob. I think we saw a number of customers come in, lay the orders in -- that’s where we saw a lot of the strength. But by the same token, we were really seeing requested deliveries extend more than we would traditionally see and whether that’s folks bringing their inventories down, being cautious; every customer has a different story.  I think the approach the team is taking is we’re going to be pleased with that backlog build, not be overconfident about what it might suggest for the year and make sure that we continue to go get the business we can, but in turn lay in the cost actions to make sure that we drive profitability this year even if things happen to take a turn for the worse.
Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers:  You haven’t mentioned how the overall economic backdrop in this quarter rolled out relative to expectations. In the fourth quarter, you did mention that you had begun to anticipate the possibility of some weakness and taken some actions and so forth. I mean, how did this quarter roll out in sort of a macro view relative to expectations, where were the pluses and minuses?
Larry Culp:  I would say that on balance, Bob, it’s hard to point much in the macro that was wildly different. I mean clearly, if you look at the way the first quarter played out, we saw strong performance in a number of our key growth platforms but overall, I think a softer start to the year.  I would really point to Dental there, as we suggested. At Sybron the way the business is operated, we’ve tended to have very strong quarters at the end of the sales compensation year. We saw that in ‘06, we saw that in ’07 and then, the following quarter can be a little soft. I think we saw that effect. Now, it’s hard to parse that from the slower demand. I think a lot of folks are talking about and seeing in the U.S. around some of the higher end, some of the elective procedures. We’re heartened by the fact that Damon is still up double-digit, but we saw that slow down. I think, as Dan reiterated a moment ago, the equipment business is where I think some people would have thought, well that might be what gets hit first, was actually very good in the U.S., it was very good in Europe, it was the changes in distribution in Asia, which took a little longer to nail down, probably had a little bit more impact than we might have anticipated, but that’s really on our books, can’t lay that on the macro scene.  You put all that together I think we still feel good about where dental will be, both consumables and equipment in ‘08. I think we saw continued softness in the U.S., in the businesses that we’ve been talking about, tools was a little bit weaker at retail despite the strong ups at Lowe’s. We talked about motion a moment ago. The Accu-Sort push outs, I think, are related to the macro environment but again, those are a couple of customers. Perhaps execution with respect to the project, perhaps a little bit of budgetary cautiousness, it’s hard to pin that down.  But we knew the U.S. was likely to be softer as opposed to stronger in the first quarter and I think that’s what played out in some of these numbers. But again, that coupled with a few things that are controllable by us and we know will be better in the second quarter, better in the second half, I think give us the optimism to say that we see sequential improvement in the second quarter and through the year from this starting point with respect to organic growth.
Robert Cornell - Lehman Brothers:  My last question, I mean, you gave the second quarter guidance and you reiterated full year. What is the organic growth expectation in guidance for the second quarter and the year at this point?
Larry Culp:  I would think at this point, for the rest of the year, we should be in the mid single-digit range.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley:  A couple of little things. Can you remind us why Sata Tools was weak in the quarter? 
Dan Comas:  What did we say there before?
Larry Culp:  Sata was actually up double-digit.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley:  I thought you said down double-digit.
Larry Culp:  No. It was up double-digit.
Dan Comas:  No, up double-digit.
Larry Culp:  We were looking at each other.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley:  Then I heard you incorrectly. Then that kind of answers that question, because I was a little taken back. It’s early in earnings and I’m already hearing things opposite.
Larry Culp:  You were taken aback?
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley:  Yes, sorry. Guys, can you talk a little bit about the cycle history at Tektronix? I mean, I understand the driver here being R&D more than kind of tech budgets overall, and that it is more stable. But is there any history you can talk about of the volatility or variability of the order patterns there?
Larry Culp:  I think when we look at TEK, clearly I mean, you really have two businesses, right? You’ve got the core Tektronix business and you have the communications business, and I think they tend to operate, Scott, to different beats. Clearly you’re going to see a little bit more of that on the communications side. We have two pieces there. We talked about network diagnostics, which is where we sell primarily into the equipment manufacturers, that has been soft and I think we would anticipate that on balance that will be soft through the course of this year. That tends to be more of a book and ship type business. Then our management business, where we sell principally to the operators is more of a longer cycle business where you have contracts, operating agreements and the like. That’s a healthy, much more stable business, unfortunately a larger portion of that side of TEK.  I would say that on the core TEK business, it tends to operate in a more traditional way given it doesn’t have that exposure to some of the high-tech production volatility that other businesses might.
Dan Comas:  Scott, I would add that one of the things is we did due diligence as best we could and one of the things we talked about with the company is if you look back over the past decade, there’s always been more volatility in orders than shipments with Tektronix. Particularly in the communications business, they would get large blanket orders, kind of service work that would get worked on over a 12- or 24-month period. They unfortunately were in the habit of reporting orders; one of the things they said to us during diligence, they wished they never got into that habit. There’s clearly more volatility in orders, but if you get down to shipments, it is less.
Scott Davis - Morgan Stanley:  A last question on Tektronix. When you talk about the fairly high R&D number and then just on a back of a piece of paper I’m calculating out that it must be 10% of sales or something in that range, give or take. But the, as sales levels, is that a fixed number or do you get leverage off of that? Meaning when you are able to grow sales, do you feel like you’ve got the scale in that R&D facility to kind of hold that expense pretty steady or does that need to grow with sales?
Larry Culp:  Well I think as we find additional opportunities, Scott, we’re obviously going to fund that, but I think there’s a lot of leverage to be had here. Again, this gets back to the comment I made earlier to Deane with respect to both linking the R&D effort more tightly to the marketplace, and in turn being more aggressive, being more effective in our go-to-market activities. Some of that is just in a more decentralized, more market-based approach in how we sell in market but there are a number of other things that I think we can do here to help the great R&D engine that Tektronix has had be more meaningful to shareholders.
Operator:  We’ll go next to Jeff Sprague - Citigroup.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  On the TEK digestion, are we all done now with the non-cash charges and all that?
Dan Comas:  As we said in December and January, there is about $0.12 or $0.13 for the year. We had $0.06 of that charge in the first quarter, so there’ll be about $0.06 or $0.07 of that through the balance of the year and we’ll be done in the fourth quarter with it.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  On Motion I was unclear, Larry, the comment about double-digit orders in March, was that just relating to the standard motors where you had the weakness or was that entirely across all of Motion?
Dan Comas:  Jeff, that was across all of Motion and it was for the first quarter.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  On TEK I was wondering if you could elaborate, you had said that the mid single-digit strength in the first quarter was stronger than you were expecting over the balance of the year on TEK as a standalone basis. Would you expect revenues to actually be contracting here now for a quarter or two as you digest, or flattish, or what’s kind of the basic direction?
Larry Culp:  I think as you look through the rest of the year Jeff, I think we’ll be up but we won’t be up at the rate that we were in the first quarter.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  Finally on Dental, you called out possible benefit from accelerated depreciation. Does that imply that you’ve actually seen some anticipatory weakness in equipment sales? Do you think people are holding back waiting for that? Was there something discernible there around larger equipment sales that you can call out?
Larry Culp:  Jeff from where we sit, and I’ve asked that question myself of a lot of folks, I mean we had a good quarter with respect to large ticket equipment in the U.S., particularly given how strong the second half of last year was. Everybody that I talk to who has been in this business has seen these type of plays in the dental world before are of the view that as the second half is upon us dentists, their accountants, understand the opportunity when we began to make plans to take full advantage of the accelerated depreciation toward the end of the year.  So I think we won’t see much; hopefully we won’t see a fall-off, but I think as the year plays out it will be a real positive for us; it should be a positive for us with the digital imaging products as well.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  Just on the cosmetic elective side, I guess you called out a little bit of softness there?
Dan Comas:  Yes.
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup:  Larry, what do you see going on in the M&A pipeline?
Larry Culp:  We had our review just on Tuesday here Jeff. Clearly there is a bit of a seachange going on with respect to certain potential competitors falling to the sidelines, but I think on balance we’ve looked at this year as the year in which we’re likely to have another big year with respect to new businesses coming on board.  Obviously if things continue to get sloppy, that’s a net positive for us in this regard; we have every intention of taking full advantage of that. So on balance, I am very encouraged about where we are positioned, how we are positioned for this to be another active year on the M&A front.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse.
Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse:  Just to follow up on Jeff’s question on Dental, I can understand on the equipment side based on the distribution issues in Asia improving, you could understand why that should pick up over the balance of the year. Could you maybe give us a sense, with cosmetics a little bit soft in the first quarter, differentiate between consumables and equipment and then also kind of sensitivity to the high end versus mid or lower end?
Larry Culp:  With respect to equipment?
Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse:  I would say yes, on that front, sure. I’d also just say, when you think about the cosmetic size and restorative and orthodontics, I guess sensitivity of the customer base to changes in discretionary income?
Larry Culp:  I think with respect to equipment again, we saw a very solid quarter in the U.S. and in Europe. I think the softness that we are referring to at the high-end procedure-wise, really did not present itself in our equipment sales. I think that was particularly true given what we’ve seen in the 3D world where obviously this is a significant six-digit investment for doctors.  So, when we talk about some of the elective procedure volumes softening up, case starts and the like, I think that on balance it was an impact we saw on the consumable side. Again, it’s hard to segment that off from the effect of the sales comp year at Sybron, both in Ormco and Kerr, but we are watching that space very carefully; I’ll be out with the team next week in fact making sure that we are going for all the growth that we can, but also supporting our investments internationally where I think we have a lot of growth that we have yet to tap into.
Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse:  A follow up on M&A. With respect to seller viewpoints on willingness to come down on price, given the tightness in the credit markets, the U.S. slowing, have you seen any willingness on the part of sellers to come down and negotiate more, or are they still looking in the rearview mirror?
Dan Comas:  I would say over the past quarter it’s gotten better, but I think there is more room to go, and that’s just our sense of it. We’ve had some discussions over the last 90 days; sellers have come down and maybe not in our view enough. So I think its trending the right way, and in our view I think it continues to get better here in the next quarter or too.
Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse:  One last one just on motion with the orders up double-digits. Could you maybe elaborate on the difference between elevator growth versus aerospace and defense, I mean particularly in light of UTX this morning, I think for the first time acknowledging it looks like commercial is going to slow in the U.S. and Europe?
Larry Culp:  I think if we just speak to what we have seen here of late, both of those customers/markets were very healthy in the first quarter.
Dan Comas:  But in terms of going forward, Nicole, if you just looked at the order book that we have in Motion today we would have a extremely robust view for growth for Motion for the balance of the year, but we’re discounting that because of comments -- if you look at the order book and be very optimistic but I think given the environment, given some comments from customers we’ve sort of scaled that back down, if you will.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities:  A question about working capital and free cash flow. I mean certainly you’ve still put up a respectable conversion. I’m sure knowing you guys that you are not comfortable with where the working capital was in the quarter, especially relative to last year, but my calculation if you get back to the turns you were at the end of last year, it’s a couple of hundred million dollars of free cash flow just on its own and I am wondering if that’s realistic? I mean obviously doing an acquisition towards the end of the year there is some things you take on there that you got to digest, but is that realistic do you think at the end of the year?
Dan Comas:  John, what I would say is I agree with your point of view we were not happy with our working capital performance in the quarter. Our expectation is it will improve. We’ve talked about $5 per share of free cash flow for the year, and working capital needs to improve to hit that target and we’re confident that it will.
Larry Culp:  John, if I can just add to that and I would agree. We’re not happy with the way the quarter played out. I mean at 106%, I think that’s still strong conversion. Keep in mind that we had $20 million of cash charges at TEK of a one-time nature; you give us that, obviously the conversion is on par with a year ago.  I don’t want to rationalize the performance though with the Easter impact on collections and the backlog build perhaps having some impact on inventory. It’s not the way I think about it, it’s not the way we think about it, it’s certainly not the conversation we’re having internally. We’re going to be driving DBS fundamentals here on the process side, it just comes down to daily management, we’d like to making sure we’re getting results there that we want. So, I think we’re going to do better there and we’re already seeing that with respect to the European collections. Again, I think to the point Dan is making about $5 a share from a cash perspective, we’re confident we’re going to have a very strong year this year.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities:  I would just imagine that given what you’re able to do historically with DBS that mid single-digit core growth along with the recent acquisition of Tektronix that it seems like getting back to where you were just on a turns basis last year should not be an insurmountable task.
Larry Culp:  We have work to do, but we don’t have a disagreement with you.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from John Inch - Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  Environmental continues to be the star of the portfolio, tough comps though, heading into the rest of this year. Could you guys talk a little bit about why you think those numbers continue to stay good,and maybe a little bit more color on what’s going on there?
Larry Culp:  I think clearly, John, the strength we’ve seen at Water really across the board at Hach-Lange, at Trojan, with the new business ChemTreat, however you want to cut it by geography, by product category, just very strong momentum; a very good tone. Clearly, we’re going to watch carefully what happens here in the U.S. and in Western Europe, but they’ve also I think have probably done as good a job as any Danaher company in stepping up their investments, stepping up their execution, not only in China -- I know we talk about that a lot -- but really throughout Asia-Pac, Eastern Europe, Latin America. There are a number of things that I think will allow us to accelerate some of our growth in particular regions this year as a result.  I think it’s the momentum that they have, it’s the absence of even a murmur right now of softness in the core markets and it’s the international exposure that we have that gives us confidence that again our water quality business will be a real star for us this year and one of our growth leaders.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  Larry, you go back to the pipeline discussion and it just strikes me these businesses are showing themselves to be, at least for now, relatively impervious to this economic malaise. What about the dynamic of adding maybe some critical mass to some of these areas? Is it that the deals are just too expensive? I know ChemTreat was going to be isolated, but what about sort of building some of this portfolio out over time and if not the U.S. other parts of the world, how should we think about those opportunities?
Larry Culp:  John, we’ve been in the market for good water quality businesses for 15 years and that doesn’t change; I think both with respect to value and frankly quality of the asset anything that is in the strike zone we are going to go after. No change in approach there.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  I’m just wondering if the market opportunity lends itself now given valuations to maybe executing a transaction sooner versus later.
Larry Culp:  Well I think we are optimistic, as Dan suggested, I think in a number of areas expectations are coming in but that doesn’t suggest at least at this point that they’ve come in where they need to for us to make something happen.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  I understand.
Larry Culp:  John, rest assured, it’s a high priority for us; we work that very hard on a daily basis.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  If you were to look at your organic growth, do you have a sense of what was it in the U.S. versus Europe versus maybe Asia or rest of world?
Dan Comas:  John, Asia and Latin America continue to be very strong probably high single-digit. The U.S. was flat to probably slightly down and Europe, probably a modest decile from Q4 but still pretty healthy, most of our larger businesses continue to perform well in Europe.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  So, you don’t see any warnings signs in your European businesses, just based on mix or anything like that?
Dan Comas:  Again, it’s slightly less; a little less growth than we saw in the second half but still -- and Larry and I have been there a number of times in the quarter, and a good performance in the first quarter and still a pretty positive outlook.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  If you go back to ‘01, I’m juxtaposing the $60 million charge you took as part of that downturn versus say last quarter’s $13 million and I guess there is a little bit more baked in this quarter and expected over the second quarter.  Larry, I know the portfolio has changed, you’re obviously a much bigger company. Would you say that the actions you have taken kind of position you comparably to the results of the actions that you took heading into the recession of ’01? How should we be thinking about Danaher’s positioning at this point? Because you were early in taking this action, I think a lot of us are trying to surmise are you going to be more permeable versus other companies that may be more late to the action story?
Dan Comas:  John, one difference there is -- and then obviously for Larry -- but the restructuring charge we took in 2001 was kind of a cash restructuring charge to reposition our businesses. The charge we talked about here in the balance of the year is a non-cash acquisition charge related to Tektronix, and the restructuring charges we took in Q4 and Q1 and we plan to take in Q2 are part of our continuing earnings per share.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  No, I understand; but I’m still saying 13 versus the 60, that was sort of the comparison. It is a smaller number and obviously we wonder does that mean you are going to have to take more if this recession or whatever you want to call it in the States actually gets a little bit worse? That’s all.
Larry Culp:  Right, well again, I think it’s a bit apples and oranges, but if you were think about the fourth quarter of ‘07 compared to what we did back then I would encourage you, John, to incorporate the $10 million that we took in the first quarter of this year and perhaps the $10 million we’re going to take in the second quarter. That’s a basket of activity, if you will, that we’re just going to take along the way here to make sure that we’re prepared to deliver to outperform as this environment plays out.  I mean, I think as we look at it, again there are a lot of things to be encouraged by: the growth drivers, the international side, the backlog build, the U.S. stimulus coming. But we’ve got to focus on what we can control, so we’re trying to make sure we protect our growth investments, short-term product launches, AQT, some other things that are forthcoming, the go-to-market investments; we talked about emerging markets. Certainly the long-term opportunities as well, be it M&A, be it the technology investments.  But to make sure that we are aligning the cost structure with the reality and with the potential downside risks. So, that’s what we can control. Are we prudent? Are we are overly conservative? You choose. But I think what we want to do is have a balanced approach that allows us to perform, deliver in the short-term here and over the long haul.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch:  Balance is what we want to see. Thank you very much.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank:  I guess with global growth probably on a downward path there’s probably a risk that core growth remains closer to 2% than 5%. How much buffer is there in your full year guidance? I mean, can you still make the range with 2% core growth for the full year?
Dan Comas:  We did in the first quarter; we delivered 15% earnings growth on 2% and the high end of the range is 15% for the full year. Now I wouldn’t want to count on it, but I think it suggests that it doesn’t have to be 5% for us to deliver our range; it’s probably somewhere between the two numbers.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank:  The healthcare margins, I think you called out three factors: you called out AQT, the euro, and I think Dental. Could you just maybe put some numbers around those three factors?
Dan Comas:  Well, I think the impact of flat revenues in Dental, I’m not sure I’d be able to quantify it right now; I could probably do it offline. I think on Radiometer we’ve had the lowest operating margins at Radiometer since the time of the acquisition and that was entirely driven by the launch of AQT where we’re still -- and this will be the last quarter -- we’ve got a lot of R&D and a lot of launch costs. That R&D has already begun to ramp down so you will see Radiometer’s margins accelerate.  Radiometer’s margins year-on-year were down 300 basis points centered around the launch and that will go away here starting in the second quarter.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank:  Maybe the way to think about that would be Radiometer gets back to maybe flat margins by the second half of the year or maybe down slightly?
Dan Comas:  I think that’s fair. I think for the balance of the year Radiometer will be relatively flat, still with a lot of launch costs for the AQT line.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank:  Finally on FNET, you talked about some lumpiness in the prior year, but is there any underlying weakness at all in the telecom markets that you can see?
Larry Culp:  Well keep in mind, Nigel, that at FNET we really serve the enterprise -- the telecom, the operators -- are really more of the focus for us at TEK. I think the enterprise environment from our view has decelerated. There were a couple of bright lights, a couple of areas of concern so it’s kind of a mixed read right now. But with the very tough comp we had, a small part of the business but when we get these big one-off projects we love them when we have them; obviously it nicks us from a growth perspective the following year.  I think from a TEK perspective clearly we see the equipment manufacturers going through some difficult times right now. But with respect to the operators there are opportunities; they are spending money around technology and that’s what that business is about, that’s why we acquired it.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank:  Just one quick one as well on Tools in the U.S., maybe Craftsman. I mean is this all due to point-of-sales weakness or are there some inventory adjustments going on there as well?
Larry Culp:  It’s by and large POS.
Operator:  We’ll take our last question from Richard Eastman - Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert Baird:  On the MedTech business I guess you went a long way there in explaining the operating margin decline. Is the DBS driven improvement at Leica and KaVo is that on plan in the quarter as we push into ‘08?
Larry Culp:  I would say Leica is performing very well in that regard, Rick. I would say that at KaVo, particularly in Germany, we’ve got some improvements opportunities that we’re all over. Phil’s there this week in fact making sure that as we gear up for the next leg here in the second quarter that we’re very focused on driving those deeper to fundamental changes to our process both with respect to cost and the P&L and the balance sheet.
Richard Eastman - Robert Baird:  As we’ve made the changes in distribution on the equipment side in Asia and you mentioned Japan and China in particular, have there been -- I realize the sales impact of those changes -- but has there been some disproportionate cost impact there as well?
Dan Comas:  I can’t quantify it but you’re right, I mean there clearly would be some impact of that.
Richard Eastman - Robert Baird:  Lastly from a consolidated perspective, it looks like pricing added about a point to the quarter. Should we assume that continues for the balance of the year?
Dan Comas:  It’s just under 1.5 and that’s probably the right way to model it for the balance of the year.
Operator:  That does conclude the question-and-answer session today. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Andy Wilson for any additional or closing remarks.

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Andy Wilson: Good morning everyone thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to point out that our earnings release is available on our website under the heading earnings. As our year end Form 10-K has not yet been filed we’ve included as part of the earnings release the fourth quarter income statement, year end balance sheet and cash flow statement. In addition we’ve included data in the press release reflecting our business segmentation as well as segmental supplemental income statement data to facilitate your analysis. Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix since its acquisition in November 2007. As we previously discussed, included in Tektronix results are certain non-cash acquisition related charges for purchase and process research and development and a fair value adjustment to record inventory and deferred revenue which reduced net earnings by $66 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the quarter. In addition non-cash acquisition related charges in the 2008 first quarter and full year will be approximately $0.05 per share and $0.13 per share respectively. These charges are excluded from our earnings per share guidance to be provided at the end of the prepared remarks. Information with regard to the components of these charges will be included in our year end Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC. Access to a webcast presentation supplementing today’s call can be found under the heading of Web Events. This call will be replayed through January 28th and the audio portion will be archived on our website later today and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. Our website address is www.Danaher.com. [Executive Instructions] I’d also like to note that in order to help you understand the company’s direction we’ll be making some forward looking statements during the call including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filing. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward looking statements that we might make today. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward looking statements except as required by law.  With respect to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call today the accompanying information required by SEC Regulation G relating to those measures can be found in the Investor section of our website under the sub-heading Earnings. With that I’d like to turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Culp: Good morning everyone. We are very pleased to report to you that 2007 was another record year for Danaher. On the financial front revenues grew to over $11 billion, adjusted earnings per share grew 19% and our free cash flow exceeded $1.5 billion highlighted by our record quarterly free cash flow performance of more than $500 million. Two thousand seven saw us consummate the largest acquisition in our history, Tektronix and we strengthened the portfolio with 11 other acquisitions. In July we successfully completed the divestiture of our Power Quality business to better focus our efforts on our outstanding growth platforms. All in all 2007 was a good year for Danaher. Turning to the fourth quarter we are very pleased with the continuation of our sales and earnings growth. Our fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.97 included in the earnings per share results were the negative impact of approximately $0.20 per diluted share of non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix as well as the benefit of approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to reductions of income tax reserves as a result of the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters. Absent these two matters adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.12 or a 19% increase over last year’s comparable adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.94. For the full year earnings per share form continuing operations was $3.72. In addition to the fourth quarter items identified a moment ago full year 2007 earnings per share benefited from a $0.02 per diluted share gain related to the collection of indemnity proceeds and a $0.02 per diluted share gain resulting primarily from the impact of income tax rate reduction in certain international jurisdictions. Excluding these gains as well as for fourth quarter items just mentioned adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2007 was $3.83 an increase of 19% compared to 2006 full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Revenues from continuing operations for the quarter increased 19.5% to a record $3.1 billion as revenues from existing businesses referred to as core revenues grew 4.5%. Acquisitions contributed 10.5% and currency had a positive impact of 4.5% in the quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2007, revenues from continuing operations increased 16.5% to a record $11 billion. Core revenues were up 4.5%, acquisitions contributed 8.5% and currency had a positive impact of 3.5%.  Year over year gross margins for the fourth quarter improved 130 basis points to 46.2%. Several factors contributed to this improvement including leverage from higher revenues, higher gross margins and our recently acquired businesses and the impact of ongoing cost saving initiatives. Gross margins for the full year improved 140 basis points to 45.7% primarily due to the same factors. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were 24.5% of sales compared with 23.9% a year ago. For the full year SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 24.6% due to higher SG&A structures in our recently acquired businesses as well as increased sales force investments in emerging markets including India, the Middle East and China. Research and Development spending as a percentage of sales for the three and 12 month ended December 31, 2007, was 6.9% and 5.5% respectively as compared to 4.2% and 4.6% a year ago. This increase is primarily due the mix of newer businesses with higher R&D structures as well as a $16 million non-cash acquisition related charge for Tektronix which increased R&D spending as a percent of sales approximately 190 basis points in the quarter and 55 basis points for the full year. Operating profit for the quarter was $465 million including $68 million of non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Absent these charges adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $533 million a 21% increase compared to adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year operating profit was $1.7 billion a 16% increase compared to last year and a 21% increase excluding the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Operating margins for the quarter were 14.8% a 200 basis point decrease over 2006. Operating margins from existing businesses contributed 70 basis points of improvement with particular strength in Medical Technologies. The impact of recently acquired businesses particularly Tektronix in the associated acquisition related charges had a diluted impact on the quarters operating margin. For the year operating margins were 15.8% in line with 2006. Operating margins adjusted exclude the impact of recently acquired businesses and the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix improved 85 basis points. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $30 million compared with $25 million for the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily a result of the net increase of borrowings related to the acquisition of Tektronix. Our affected income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.3% compared to 23.4% in the fourth quarter of ’06. A reduction of income tax reserves in the fourth quarter was offset by the tax treatment of certain non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Net income from continuing operations were $320 million for the quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. Included in the fourth quarter and full year net income was approximately $66 million of non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix. Excluding these charges as well as the previously mentioned gains in both periods related to collection of indemnity proceeds the impact of income tax reductions in certain international jurisdictions and the sale of securities in 2006, adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 22% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year as compared to adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the same period in 2006. Including a gain on sale of the Power Quality business in July of ’07 full year net income was $1.4 billion. Record operating cash was from continuing operations were $1.7 billion for 2007 an 11% increase over 2006. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures was a record $509 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. This is the first quarter where our free cash flow is exceeded the $500 million mark. For the year free cash flow was $1.5 billion a 10% increase over 2006. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the year was 127% making 2007 the 16th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded our net income. The Danaher business system continues to be the driver behind the significant and sustained cash flow performance. Capital expenditures for the year increased approximately 19% to $162 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital ratio of 29% and over $230 million in cash and cash equivalents at years end. Turning to our operating segments Profession Instrumentation revenue increased 37% for the quarter to $1.1 billion with revenues from existing businesses contributing 5.5%. Full year revenues increased 22% to $3.5 billion as revenues from existing businesses contributed 6.5%. Operating margins for the 2007 fourth quarter were 16% as compared to 22.3% in the prior year. Absent the negative impact of recently acquired businesses including non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix adjusted operating margins improved by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter driven by additional leverage from our sales growth in our Fluke and Water Quality businesses and margin improvement activities in our Gilbarco Veeder-Root business. For 2007 full year operating margins were 20.1% a decrease of 140 basis points compared to 2006 while adjusted margins which exclude the items mentioned above improved 135 basis points. Environmental platform revenues for the quarter were 22.5% with core revenues up by 5.5%. For the full year environmental revenues increased 16.5% with revenues from existing businesses up 6%. Water Quality core revenues grew to high single digit rate in the fourth quarter led by continued momentum from Hach Ultra Process and lab products. Particularly in China where we continue to expand our sales force initiatives. Sales across North America were also strong and Hach Lange posted its best quarter of the year with double digit growth.  In Trojan we achieved double digit revenue growth for the year with strength across most geographies and with particular success in both drinking and waste water application. During the fourth quarter we shipped a multi-million dollar order to Brisbane, Australia, addressing the regions initiative to convert wastewater to suitable drinking water as a result of the ongoing drought in the area. In addition Trojan enters 2008 with year end backlog at an historic high. Our acquisition of ChemTreat is progressing well, the business achieving high single digit revenue growth in the quarter compared to its results in the fourth quarter of ’06 as a stand along company. Gilbarco Veeder-Root’s core revenues grew low single digits for the quarter and the year as we did not see year end orders materialize in Mexico. Despite restructuring activities in the fourth quarter GVR improved its operating margins in the quarter by more than 100 basis points as compared to the same period in 2006 a result of ongoing DBS improvement in factory and higher margins from recently introduced new products. Moving to test and measurement our new name for our electronic test platform, revenues were up 64.5% in the quarter with core revenue contributing 5.5%. Full year revenues increased 31.5% as core revenue contributed 8%. Fluke core revenues grew at a high single digit rate for the quarter with solid international growth particularly in China, Latin America and Australia where sales were up double digits. During the quarter Fluke innovation efforts led to the introduction of the new Ti10 and Ti25 break through products in thermography to bring easier functionality and reliability at a price point that we expect to drive significant growth in the industrial maintenance market. Fluke’s innovation efforts continue to gain public recognition during the quarter as the company won best in test from Test Measurement World Magazine for its new bench top digital multi-meter designed in our China development center. Fluke Network sales were flat for the quarter as a result of several large prior year orders that didn’t reoccur in 2007. F-Net sales finished the year up mid single digits with particular strength across Asia/Pacific and in Europe. In addition operating margins improved over 100 basis points during the year. As I mentioned at the outset of the call we finalized the acquisition of Tektronix in the quarter. The integration is proceeding very well, DBS implementation is on track and we are confident we will attain our cost reduction targets. Collaborative efforts between Fluke and Tektronix have already helped identify a number of significant opportunities in both product development and in market penetration. We are excited at this point about the progress the team has accomplished to date and look forward to sharing further successes with you throughout 2008. Moving now to Medical Technologies, revenues for the quarter increased 24% to $866 million compared to 2006 as quarter revenues contributed 9.5%. Broad based improvements across all businesses contributed to this growth. For the full year 2007 sales increased 35% to approximately $3 billion with core revenues contributing 8%. Med Tech operating margins for the fourth quarter were 15.3% compared to 14.6% a year ago. Absent the negative impact of approximately 120 basis points related to newly acquired businesses adjusted margins for the fourth quarter 2007 improved approximately 190 basis points over the fourth quarter 2006 primarily driven by leverage from higher revenue. For the full year operating margins improved 130 basis points to 13.1% when compared to the prior year. Turning to our Dental businesses fourth quarter core revenues grew at a high single digit rate. Sales of consumables, imaging equipment as well as our minimally invasive product offerings contributed to this performance. Full year 2007 Dental revenues also grew at a mid single digit rate. We continue to see excellent results in the Dental consumables business which enjoyed high single digit growth in 2007 and significant margin expansion. Growth was broad based across all major geographies and product categories. A great example of this performance was the success of the Kerr Demi Light, for many of you who attended the mid year analyst meeting in September you may recall the demonstration of the portable LED curing light a high powered compact light used to cure and restore materials such as composites, bonding agents and cements. We launched the product back in August and since that time Kerr has recorded sales approaching $10 million helping it achieve double digit growth in this product category. Within Dental Equipment we experienced geographic strength in North America where we believe we are taking share partially offset by softness in Asia reflecting a weak Japanese market. Imaging revenues were up double digits driven by both Gendex and Dexis two dimensional panoramic products as well as the continued robust sales of ISI’s iCAT 3D imaging systems both in the US and in Europe where the product was launched mid year 2007. If we were to include ISI in our core growth calculation for the quarter Dental Equipment would have increased at a mid single digit rate. During the quarter KaVo launched Comfort Drive which is the first hand piece in the market that combines the ergonomics of turbines with the power of electrics. We believe this hand piece will set a new standard in the market and represents an excellent example of using our voice of customer and innovations DBS tools to create what we believe to be a multi-million opportunity. At Radiometer core revenues grew at a low double digit rate for the quarter and a high single digit rate for the year driven by instruments placements throughout Europe. In QT our pointed care offering used to detect cardiac markers which we displayed at our year end analyst meeting launched in the UK and Australia earlier this month. In the US clinical trials are continuing and we obviously look forward to sharing early market feedback with you in the near future. Leica Microsystems core revenues grew to low double digit rate in the quarter and a mid teens rate for the year driven by robust microsity demand in particular Confocal microscopes. Geographically growth was broad based and benefited from Leica’s strong portfolio of new products which have been brought to market in the last two years. In 2007 Leica generated more than 50% of its revenue from these new products. Our Leica Biosystems business continues to enjoy very healthy growth driven in part by more than 30% growth in our Vision Systems business. This growth resulted from strong sales of innovated bond, amino hista chemistry advanced standing systems as well as increase sales in specimen preparation handling equipment a result of the successful integration of the Vision and Leica sales forces. Moving to our Industrial Technology segment revenues increased 7% for the quarter to $812 million with revenues from core businesses up 2.5%. Full year revenues increased 5% to $3.2 billion with revenues from core businesses were up 1.5%. Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 16.3% essentially flat compared to the same period a year ago. Margins were negatively impacted by new acquisitions, spending for product development and emerging market sales force initiatives as well as restructuring activities. These cost activities should help drive continued margin expansion in 2008. For the year operating margins increased approximately 120 basis points to 16.9%.  Product Identification revenues increase 9% during the quarter with core revenues increasing 3.5%. Product ID full year revenues were up 3.5% with core revenues decreasing 1%. The full business in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 adversely impacted full year core revenue growth by more than 800 basis points.  Growth in our core marking business was up mid single digits driven by strong performance in our Laser business which grew more than 20%. The primary growth driver has the CO2 laser platform which provides permanent marking on a variety of services through high speed steered beam technology. This platform which replaced 17 Legacy lasers now accounts for more than 40% of Videojet’s laser business. Switching to Motion, revenues were up 5.5% in the quarter the core revenues 0.5%. For the full year Motion increased 2.5% with revenues from core businesses declining 1%. Motions performance continues to be adversely impacted by softness in its tech and markets particularly in semi-con and electronic assembly. Motion did experience a rebound of bookings in its flat panel display business in the fourth quarter which bodes well for this market segment in 2008. Our OEM elevator business grew revenue double digits in 2007 a result of robust motor sales to Otis and a new product launch with [inaudible]. Elevator product demand continues to be healthy entering 2008 due to the global conversion to more energy efficient systems and commercial construction demand in the developing world. Motion is pursuing a number of growth opportunities in clean energy and recently announced winning a greater than $10 million with Hagland a division of BAE Systems for the design, development and delivery of an electric propulsion system for military vehicles. Motion’s custom design capabilities for high powered motors and drives is proving to be very attractive for hybrid applications in both Aerospace and Defense markets as well as in heavy duty and specialty vehicles. We expect to announce additional development contract wins in the near future. Finally moving to Tools and Components revenue for the quarter was $365 million down 2%. For the full year revenues for Tools and Components decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. Operating margins for the quarter were 11.8% a decrease of 290 basis points from the prior year due primarily to lower volumes in our mechanics hand tool business with Sears and in our Jacobs Vehicle Systems business. In addition, costs associated with the fire in our Shandong, China tool facility as well as additional restructuring spending in the quarter negatively impacted operating margins. For the full year operating margins decreased approximately 130 basis points to 13.1% primarily due to these same reasons. Hand tool revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter for the year sales increased 1%. Double digit growth at Lowe’s helped partially offset decline in sales to Sears/Kmart during the quarter. Looking back on 2007 we see a year where we successfully reach a number of milestones. Exceeding $11 billion in revenue, generating more than $1.5 billion in free cash flow and significantly expanding our now $2.5 billion position in Test and Measurement. Looking ahead in 2008 despite ongoing weakness that began in the middle of 2007 in some of our OEM and customer facing businesses we will continue to see strength across most of the portfolio.  We are however well aware that current global economic concerns and accordingly took the meaningful cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter. In addition, we have developed comprehensive contingency plans within each of our businesses. We are poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and address uncertainties as they present themselves this year and remain confident in our ability again deliver and outperform in 2008. Given this outlook we are reaffirming our December adjusted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.89 with full year 2008 adjusted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40 which excludes the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix.
Operator:  [Operator Instructions] We’ll go first to John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Since obviously there’s been a lot of consternation around the economy just even in the past few weeks. Since the analyst meeting have you noticed a discernable change in any of your businesses either the US or Europe or anywhere else?
Larry Culp: Since we saw you in December, obviously the headlines have been consistently and persistently negative but on balance what we are seeing I think with very few exceptions is pretty steady and a lot of our business leaders are trying to figure out what the newspapers and the talking heads on television are seeing out there. Not that we’re putting our heads in the sand but you look at the way we finished with a lot of the businesses, we have but two and one half weeks of bookings so that’s a little hard to read too much into January.  Obviously we ended up being a little softer than we had anticipated at Sears at year end, I think that’s been well publicized. We’ve seen I think in Asia consistent strong growth, in US I think we’ve seen a little bit of I would say modest slowing in a place or two but really nothing I think would correlate at this point with the headlines that are out there. We feel good where we are.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: If you go back the recession of ’01 when Danaher ultimately had to take a charge and downsize to a degree. You are a much different company, that said there’s always, I would think as part of your scenario planning you would have to be thinking about those possibilities and even the possibilities of the information you are getting from the field perhaps is lagging or its being filtered in some manner. Can you talk about what levers you prospectively are able to pull if in fact you start to see some of the demand for your products, regardless of where it is, some of it start to turn South more quickly?
Larry Culp: You bet and I think it really does start with the portfolio, right? So many of the wonderful businesses that we have today like our Medical Technology business is half of what we call Test and Measurement, our Environmental business are a much bigger part of the portfolio today. It’s a very different Danaher, I think it’s a stronger portfolio than we had last time we saw a slow down in terms of the economy. When we were together in December what we try to do in the roll forward talking about our guidance is really give you a flavor for what we have laid in, in terms of flexibility with respect to the investments that we put into the businesses.  We also talked about the ongoing cost reductions that we get as a result of persistent application with DBS plus obviously all of the determined activity that we have going on. As we watch the trip wires if you will and all the businesses and we are watching everything we can right now, our own numbers and numbers with our distributor partners, our customers in the like, we will be I think quick to make sure that we pull back on investments that we can do without, that we can defer for a period of time while making sure we can continue to protect the investments that drive both the short and the long term growth prospects that we have.  We talked a little bit in prepared remarks obviously about some restructuring; it was a bigger program at the end of the year than it was a year ago. We ended up with well over 200 heads coming out the organization, I think that is the sort of thing that should be evidence to you John that we are going to be proactive we are not going to wait necessarily until its too late to do the things that we need to do to protect our profitability, our earnings as best we can in a more uncertain environment here in ’08.
John Inch – Merrill Lynch: Lastly this China fire does that roll through the other quarters this year? Should we be taking down assumptions a little bit in the T&C business or have you pretty much contained in being able both to redeploy the utilization?
Dan Comas: The team over there has really done a nice job of getting that factory up and running so I don’t see it impacting our business over there as Larry noted the concern in the Tools business is more around the US consumer.
Operator: We’ll go next to Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray – Goldman Sachs: Just a follow up on the actions that you took in the fourth quarter, were those preemptive moves that came in towards the end of the quarter or was that something you had planned all along in terms of headcount?
Larry Culp: I wouldn’t say that those were actions that were in the plan. I think if we were adjusting in the second half and certainly in the fourth quarter to some of the concerns certainly as we think about the Tools business with its exposure to the US consumer and some of the OEM facing businesses in Industrial Technologies we were making adjustments to cost structure taking actions proactively. Really in preparation for ’08 more than anything else, it obviously hurt us in the fourth quarter, we spent more than $10 million in the quarter going through those head count reductions and the attendant facility moves. We thought that was the right thing to do for those businesses, we thought it was the right thing to do frankly in preparation for ’08. 
Deane Dray – Goldman Sachs: I’ll also point out that those charges were also flowed through your operating results, is that correct?
Larry Culp: By all means, what we call restructuring I think more than anything to make sure people understand that we are on our toes ready for what may come here and we are already in to not only continuously planning across the board but taking actions in those businesses where it’s appropriate. Many other businesses I would say were prepared but we want to make sure we don’t move in a way that hurts our growth prospects in ’08.
Dan Comas: Maybe just for a quantify the activity between the restructuring and the fire and most of it being the restructuring activities we took it impacted the fourth quarter margin corporate wide by almost 50 basis points.
Deane Dray – Goldman Sachs: With regard to these contingency plans and I’m sure you are hesitant to put specific numbers on it could you give us a sense of in priorities of business of where and how you can selectively pull back discretionary spending if it works out that it needs to be done?
Larry Culp: Rest assured I’m not hesitant at all to quantify that internally but for the purpose of this call I think again it’s really a business by business activity given really the way we operate. We’ve got strategies and budgets that are tailored to each business and its situation but again whether we are talking about investments in head count, investments in opex, our factory structures, our overhead structures and the like we can defer certain investments, we can go after certain costs that exist today in ways that hopefully protect all the good growth investments we want to protect for the future but also get at perhaps some of the costs that we carry today that frankly we don’t need. Particularly if things do indeed decelerate from this point.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Citigroup Investments.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup Investments: I’ll move to another topic but not to beat theme but just one other thought on what you are observing. Many of us would remember that before the prior slow down Danaher was one of the very first to kind of raise their hand and say some things were going on before other companies did. The mix is obviously changed a lot, when you look at that little bit of slowing on the edges that you said you saw in some businesses were those businesses that were flashing the signal last cycle?
Larry Culp: I think when we talk about where saw this office we had Tools, we had Motion last time around as part of the portfolio. Motion was hit hardest because of its exposure to Tech and the bursting of that bubble. Tools was more consistent given what was happening with the US consumer that go around versus this time around. I think we are watching Gilbarco very closely given that ultimately they serve a number of retailers and obviously the retailers have the exposure maybe alter it, adjust their capitals given what consumers are doing.  We are also watching Product ID very carefully but obviously if we didn’t have either of those two businesses with us last time around. Those are businesses fortunately we were able to acquire in the down turn from folks that at the time were less prepared to preserve their portfolio, preserve their strategic options when things got soft.
Dan Comas:  If you’ll remember the last time the business where we had the most trouble, the biggest drop and where we took the hardest hit was the Power Quality business that we divested this past summer.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup Investments: Could you give us a little color on how Tektronix performed in the quarter, I’m sure it’s a little muddy now but what was their organic growth like on a stand alone basis?
Larry Culp: I wouldn’t say it was muddy per se, since the acquisition revenues were down slightly I think consistent with the soft order book that they had publicized during the summer and the fall. I think all in all we feel very good about that investment, that acquisition, we are excited about the way that team has embraced Danaher, EBS, Fluke and Fluke Networks and I think we are going to be very happy having Tek on board here. I’m very pleased we were able to bring them in last year.
Jeff Sprague – Citigroup Investments: On Med Tech it did accelerate nicely, you called out a couple things, Europe and few others but it’s always kind of tough to size those as you are bouncing through them. What do you think was really kind of the main stand out performer that kind of drove the up tick in the growth rate?
Larry Culp: I think Leica had a terrific 2007, I don’t know how to describe it otherwise virtually across the board as you look by product and by geography. Radiometer as I mentioned was also very strong. Sybron came in and contributed in the second half relative to kind of the core calculations nicely and we obviously don’t yet include fully the division in the ISI contributions but they were also very helpful here. We are very pleased with the Med Tech performance and certainly if we are looking at a bumpy ride come ’08 we are thrilled we’ve got $2.5 billion in Med Tech of businesses performing as they are currently.
Operator: We’ll go next to Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: At the risk of piling on in the macro I just have one quick follow up on Europe. When you think about where you are seeing weakness and I think in the press release you alluded to softness on the OEM side, is that just largely the tech weakness you had seen on the semi-conductor side and then with respect to Europe how do you see that playing out?
Larry Culp: With respect to Motion and the OEM comment, the softness that we’ve seen clearly has been in Tech. I think that I was with the Kollmorgan team just a week ago and that situation is pretty steady right now. It’s very interesting, there’s some puts and takes obviously its not lighting the world on fire with respect to core growth we’ve got a number of good verticals like commercial construction work in force right now the OES program and the like. It’s steady, it’s not deteriorating and I think that’s a really interesting data point when we obviously are watching virtually daily but it’s an encouraging sign.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: More specifically on Europe?
Larry Culp: I would say Europe is steady; I would describe it that way with respect to Motion and frankly the rest of the portfolio but obviously a geography that we are watching very carefully as well.
Nicole Parent – Credit Suisse: One last one on M&A, can you give us a snapshot with private equity out of the market now have you seen prices come in would you expect more activity as we roll into 2008 and kind of how you are thinking about it?
Larry Culp: I think that if you go back to 2002 when we bought Videojet, we bought Gilbarco we made a big add to Water a tough environment was good for a strategic acquirer. Lots of folks were on the sidelines at that point and if things do get sloppier out there I think prices will adjust in certain markets. Obviously the competitive set will be markedly different. We would welcome that convention to a slowdown and obviously you saw when we went out and arranged the financing with Tektronix the slug of equity was really geared toward making sure we were in a position given the uncertainty in the capital markets to be in a position to be an active strategic acquirer in a down turn.  So as we sit here in early January the balance sheet is strong, we saw a $1.5 billion of free cash, I think we are in a good position to basically run our playbook here from an M&A perspective.
Operator: We’ll go next to Bob Cornell with Lehman Brothers
Bob Cornell – Lehman Brothers: Would you just flush out the thoughts you mentioned on the combination of Tek and Fluke just how they are starting to work together, you mentioned some of the opportunities, give us a little more color there please?
Larry Culp: I’ve got to be a little careful because I know there are some folks on the call who are looking for that page of the playbook. I think what we did first of all as we always do is plug the senior team in to DBS, they’ve gotten through the initial orientation, and they’ve begun to do their own ties and events to get a flavor for what this is all about. They were already on the lean journey so this is not a foreign concept to them, they’ve taken it and just run hard. We’ve obviously been plugging in our procurement activities as well really from a corporate perspective but Fluke’s had the point on that to make sure we get the vast majority of the $40 million in the early round of cost reductions as Tek is now part of a $13 billion company not a billion dollar company. From the strategic perspective clearly there are opportunities with Fluke and with Tek as they serve the same engineers bench through similar channels in a number of markets around the world. We are working not only on some product ideas but also some channel programs to put the combined strength to its full use. I would say there are also similar opportunities; I was out in Colorado Springs last week with our Fluke Network team as we think about the communications side of Tektronix with that neck. Both from a product and a go to market perspective there are going to be things I think each business is going to help the other. The pillars just get stronger and stronger as we build the T&M business out.
Bob Cornell – Lehman Brothers: You mentioned the Tek soft order book, have you had a chance to do further due diligence on that, have an increased perspective, can you give a little color around that?
Larry Culp: I think the additional exposure that we’ve had thus far is very consistent with what they’ve said publicly and what we had discerned in our diligence. We knew that the lumpier carrier programs from an order perspective were going to be soft here. I think that was part of our opportunity. It’s not as pronounced from a shipment perspective. The other item that they flagged as you may recall is the weakness in Japan which has continued.
Bob Cornell – Lehman Brothers: Just a comment on the Radiometer new product, is that in the market? I didn’t quite get what the perspective was there?
Larry Culp: We are now shipping that product.
Bob Cornell – Lehman Brothers: What’s the impact, how’s it going?
Larry Culp: It’s been two weeks, the customers love this product, it’s now approved we’re shipping but it literally is the first full month of production. We are pumped up about that program as we ever have been.
Bob Cornell – Lehman Brothers: I didn’t hear you say in guidance what the organic growth target was for the year? I think you guided that mid single digits is that still the target?
Larry Culp: I think that’s exact; there are no changes in that regard from what we said. In December we thought we’d be in that mid single digit range this year, obviously operating as aggressively as we can where we have growth opportunities and appropriately cautiously where have some of this headline risk out there.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: Can you just run through what you expect from the different pieces of Med Tech which you would be more worried about in a tough US environment? I know that this business is thought of as less than cyclical but I’m just curious, there’s got to be some swelling in a couple of them, I’m just curious how you are thinking about that?
Larry Culp: I think that’s right, let’s be clear this is the business in all likelihood will be our best performer if the economy does decelerate further if the softness broadens. I would say that Leica and Radiometer given that they serve research and clinical applications are probably going to be well insulated simply because I think budget programs that they participate in tend to have a little bit of that longer cycle dynamic to them. Once they start they are hard to shut down, they are both going to be coming off very good years so we need to keep that in mind but that’s really the way I would think about those two legs of the Med Tech platform. I think in Dental we obviously have been benefiting on a global basis from the increased investment in technology by all levels of dental practitioners, consumables, more function of procedures and case load. We need to be watchful here relative to whether the US consumer dynamic has any impact on the dental business. Those that I’ve talked to and respect, who’ve been in the business far longer than I have I think support the assumption in your question that there won’t be a lot of impact but there could be some. We just want to watch that given the new business wars. We obviously do have a large presence here in the US. I think all in all we like where these businesses are strategically, we think they all had a very good fourth quarter and enter ’08 with a lot of optimism, a lot of confidence. We had a couple kick off sales meetings so far and the sales teams are very enthusiastic about the new products and programs here in ’08.
Dan Comas: Given these businesses that are still relatively new to the portfolio that we think we’ve got a lot more room on the margin side, we’ve got over 100 basis points of core margin improvement in ’07 and would be looking for similar type results here in ’08. I think if you’ll not only steady growth but above average op improvement for the coming years.
Steve Tusa – JP Morgan: You have a different portfolio you have some of this cost opportunity is it reasonable to assume given the last recession you guys held earnings flat if you strip out the big extraordinary charge that you guys with this portfolio might actually be able to grow earnings through a reasonably bad recession?
Larry Culp: I think that when you look at the portfolio, you look at this team; you look at DBS, come what may we are confident we are going to outperform. What that looks like you can calibrate it or model it in a number of different ways but we’re going to make the right decisions, take the tough decisions and outperform in a tough time if that evolves here as we try to do in all seasons.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ann Duignan with Bear Stearns
Ann Duignan – Bear Stearns: Sorry to beat the macro thing to death here but how do you think about organic growth by quarter or by progression through the year? Do you think stronger maybe in the first half because of easier comparables and then perhaps slowing because of lack of visibility in the back half? Do you think that interest rate cuts that are happening now may cause acceleration in the back half? Maybe talk about it by quarter, just the progression of your organic growth and how you are thinking about that?
Larry Culp: I think right now it’s obviously very early in the year, we are watching all of our indicators, talking to as many customers as we can to make sure we understand how they are thinking about budgets and capital plans for the year. What I’d say is that, as we shared with Bob a moment ago, I think we stand by the mid single digit range for the year that we talked about. I think all in all we come into the year obviously with first quarter inventories at Sears a little bit higher than I think we would have liked, they would have liked, given the softness during the holiday season. PID on the margin a little softer as well, we get an offset as you talked about with Jake Brake AVS. We need to see how the year plays out, I’m not sure that the economics department at Danaher, we don’t have one, is ready to make the call on what the Fed actions or even the stimulus program that Congress is talking about is going to kick in here in the second half. Obviously you’ve got the monetary and physical policy levers being pulled aggressively right now, that has to have a positive impact when that hits. I’m not sure our crystal ball is any better than anyone else’s. We want to focus on what we can control and go after all of the revenue opportunities we can while being just smart and prudent on the cost side.
Ann Duignan – Bear Stearns: On Product ID I have to believe given how much of that business is consumables tied to kind of industrial activity that that business may be one of the first or the early cycle businesses that might see a slow down in the near term. Is that what you were insinuating on the Product ID side?
Larry Culp: Yes and yes, I think that’s a spot on look at where we might see some softening next. If you just look at the Danaher portfolio, I think it’s less on the consumables side per se but we watch that, but also the new printers, the new laser printer, the new TTO machine going into production line. That presumably if it’s a new product introduction it’s something people could defer. We try to look at those orders; we break it down by consumables versus equipment to try to read in to what customers are going to do here in ’08. I think right now we are watching that one very carefully.
Dan Comas: The other dynamic we have with Product ID and its more within the Acu-sort business as you know they have some large project business, last couple of years with the Post Office but also with people like UPS and whether some of those projects get pushed out in this climate is a risk as well. I think the offset there is they tend to be much lower margins than the core printing and consumable piece of Videojet.
Operator: We’ll go next to Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: I was wondering if we could take a little step backwards and talk about the Tektronix and maybe remind us how you go to market, how much distribution versus direct, how much channel visibility you have, product cycles? Just a little bit of a teach in if you could on that particular business.
Larry Culp: Well keep in mind that you really break Tek down roughly call it two thirds/one third, two thirds being their core instrumentation business of oscilloscopes and other bench top products used often in research and development. That’s a business that is 60% to 65% direct, the rest being through distribution and its in some but not all of its distribution channels where we often listed literally side by side with you’ll see a fair bit of the channel synergy in that part of the business. On the communications side that is principally a direct business, when we say communication we are typically talking about network operators carriers and the like. It’s a business where we have an ongoing conversation with many of the larger customers and obviously due demand planning and the like with our distributive partners on an ongoing basis as well. That’s been a strength of the Tek organization that we are keen to leverage going forward.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: When you think about revenue drivers is it Tek capex, is it new product cycle, is it Tek capex driven by the flows of the equity markets and how much capital these companies have? It’s just an industry that I don’t cover so I’m kind of curious.
Larry Culp: I think you have a number of macro drivers there but Tek is very focused in R&D as opposed to manufacturing and all these companies obviously are wholly dependent on the next generation product being a winner. Their demand may fluctuate, they may have to adjust their spending in the factory as a result but in terms of what’s happening in the lab on the bench relative to R&D our work suggested that that’s a more stable environment and the digital revolution that we see in so many places is really fueling development spending in that regard and then turn spending for Tek products. On the communications side obviously we see the proliferation of services by the network operators and Tek helps these folks develop and deploy those new services. That’s something that we see as an eviquitive growth driver around the world for Tek. It’s that combination I think got us excited that this was a good, smart step into an adjacent market for our T&M business.
Scott Davis – Morgan Stanley: That really serves to buffer the natural tech cyclicality that’s out there is that what you are implying?
Larry Culp: I wouldn’t say that it is completely buffered, I think we acknowledged to the extent that we serve some of those tech markets if there’s volatility or cyclicality there we we’ll be exposed to some of that but its far more modest in R&D so many of the other favorable attributes of the acquisition made this one that we thought very strongly about obviously consummated.
Operator: We’ll go next to Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: A couple of quick questions, I think the first one is just looking at your cash flow, the operating cash flows and free cash flows and as you just mentioned I think your free cash flow exceed your net earnings by quite a margin. In terms of growth rate you are looking at 11% in your operating cash flow and about 10% in your free cash flow for the full year. How much of that is the fact that it’s from continuing operations and instead of net earnings including further acquisition, how much of that is to do with the change in the way that you generate cash flow the delta between your net earnings and your cash flows growth?
Dan Comas: I’m not sure exactly I get the question, let me try and you can correct me. We had a very strong performance in cash flow for the year; we did not get a lot of benefit from a new acquisition coming in. As you know Sybron occurred early in 2006 and Tektronix occurred kind of late in the year so it really was from continuing operations from the core business that we delivered this very strong cash flow.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: When you are looking at the 21% growth in your net income and you are looking at the 10% and 11% growth in the operating cash flow and free cash flow most of the difference can be attributed to what you just mentioned.
Dan Comas: Yes and the dynamic of from ’05 to ’06 when the cash flow was up I believe in the high 20’s was because of the timing of the Sybron acquisition when we brought it in and we had a lot of cash flow that last quarter because of the difference in their year end, we talked about that last year. If you look at ’05 to ’07 which I think is more representative look when you take out the impact of the timing of an acquisition free cash flow is compounded out of that 19% over that two year period.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Looking at the quality [inaudible] right now and also the impact on some of the tightening in credit is happening, are you seeing any change both in your lenders not just domestically but across the world any kind of tightening in terms of their ability to lend to you of any sort if the bank here anything at all? Secondly for your customers is there any change in tendency of your customers to actually delay payments to you?
Dan Comas: We have not seen any issues, as you know we are an A plus credit tier one commercial paper issuer and we have not had any issues either in the US or in Europe. Regarding the second point, nothing that I’m aware of, I’m sure there some instances somewhere where this tighter credit market is impacting a customer but nothing to note.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Looking at your Product ID business I think you mentioned pretty decent growth out of the laser products for marking and then you talked about the economic sensitivity of this business I think in response to a question a few minutes ago. How do you think about this business over the next two to three years, what are the major drivers that will reaccelerate growth in this business? Do we expect anything in the near term and do you plan to go from the fixed side and the desktop side in this business, get more into the mobile side of this business?
Larry Culp: We don’t have a desktop business in Product ID we’re really principally in marking and coding in production environment. There’s really no opportunity I think in our view after an acquisition to take that position out of a production environment into a mobile environment. I think the growth drivers are going to continue to be good. We didn’t report the year we would like because of the tough top line comps from ’06 because of the Postal programs.  Frankly I was thrilled with the year that we had in Product ID particularly at Videojet where they had excellent core growth, good margin expansion, we are making some smart investments that will yield things we will talk about in ’08 and ’09. I don’t think we have anything but good opportunities like the trajectory we’ve been on with Product ID. It’s just a business that clearly had a tough reporting comp in ’07 but when you look under the covers they did very well.
Operator: We’ll take our final question from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: On the Test and Measurement side of the business the core growth rate at 5.5% was certainly below trend line for the last couple of years and I know Fluke Net had a couple tough projects compares year over year, are you sensing that you are picking up any macro weakness in the Test and Measurement side of the business, excluding Tektronix, just Fluke or Fluke Net?
Larry Culp: I think the short answer is no. We finished very strong and we have but a couple weeks of orders so if something is going to happen this year we certainly aren’t seeing it in terms of our leading indicators, our order book. We tend in the fourth quarter to see some of that noise at Fluke Net depending on whether there is a big year end program here or there. I didn’t read anything and I encourage you not to read anything into the Fluke Net performance for the fourth quarter. We need to obviously watch what customers do as the year plays out. I think right now we feel very good about where T&M is excluding Tek for ’08.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: On the Med Tech platform given that we pulled this platform together over the last few years and it’s been maybe skewed a bit towards European based acquisitions, given the cost structures there and the fact that we have been operating in a very good revenue marketplace for the last couple of years do you feel comfortable that the trailing pace of cost reductions would continue to drive operating margin there if revenue growth falls off? Obviously the difficulty in taking costs out of some European operations, do you think you are far enough ahead on that curve that if we see revenue grow slow that we can comfortably deliver on the margin improvement that we’re targeting?
Larry Culp: We would certainly intend to do that. Keep in mind we talk about these European headquarter businesses their cost structures really span the globe gives us an opportunity not only to deal with head count, really anywhere not just Europe but also the new product pipeline at Leica for example has been an important part of the margin play. Having these companies come in and just buy commodities globally is part of the larger organization maybe a sharper purchasing organization to boot. Those are all cost leverage pulling that have been helping drive the margin expansion in addition to the volume and obviously are also leveraged that we think still have future impact on the business, almost regardless of the revenue environment.
Operator: That concludes the question and answer session, at this time Mr. Wilson I’ll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Andy Wilson: [Executive Instructions] Thanks for joining us.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference, thank you for your participation.

And one final note. Earlier this month, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell our power business to Thomas & Betts. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. We are currently evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Larry. 
Larry Culp: Andy, thanks. Good morning everyone. We are very pleased to report this morning that our second quarter earnings per share were $0.96. Included in our 2007 second quarter earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per share resulting from the April 2007 collection of indemnification proceeds related to a preexisting litigation matter at Accu-Sort.  Absent this item, earnings per share increased 17.5% as compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $0.80, which excludes the prior year impact of a gain of $0.03 per share related to the sale of interest in the shares of First Technology and the impact from certain tax reserve reductions of approximately $0.15.  Revenues for the quarter increased 13.5% to 2.7 billion, as revenue from existing business also described as "core revenues" grew 4.5%. As we communicated last quarter, the completion of several large US Postal projects, primarily in the first half of last year, within our product identification business as well as the impact of emission regulations on our Jacobs Vehicle Systems business, negatively impacted second quarter core revenue by approximately 150 basis points.  Year-to-date, revenues were up 16.5% to 5.2 billion, as revenues from existing businesses grew 4%. Our gross margin in the second quarter was 45.5%, a 160-basis-point increase when compared to same period last year, as gross margins were positively impacted by leverage from higher revenues, ongoing cost savings, and from the higher gross margins in our recent acquisitions, primarily Sybron and Vision.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 29.3% of sales, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year. This increase was driven by higher SG&A structures and our recent acquisitions, primarily again Sybron and Vision, and increased R&D and sales and marketing spending to fund future growth. Year-to-date, SG&A expenses were 29.8%, an increase of a 120 basis points over the first half of last year.  Operating profit was a record of $448 million for the quarter, a 17.5% increase over last year. And for the first half, operating profit was $822 million, a 21% increase over 2006. Operating margins for the quarter were 16.8%, a 60-basis-point improvement over last year with core operating margins up 90 basis points, a result of ongoing cost reductions as well as leverage from higher core revenues.  We were particularly pleased with the margin improvement in our med-tech and industrial technology segments. Year-to-date, operating margins were 15.7%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the last year with core margins up approximately 75 basis points.  Net interest expense for the second quarter was $23 million compared with $13 million for the second quarter of last year. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher debt levels related to the CP borrowings utilized to fund the Sybron and Vision acquisitions.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26.7% compared to 14.5% last year. Last year's second-quarter tax rate was positively impacted by the reduction of certain tax reserves, which resulted from the favorable resolution of various domestic and international examinations related to prior years and the realization of certain foreign tax credits. For the balance of 2007, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 27%.  Net income was $311 million, a 1% decrease over the prior-year second quarter, due to the aforementioned First Technology gain and a reduction of prior-year tax reserves, which positively impacted 2006 net earnings by approximately $58 million. For the first half of 2007, net income was a record $566 million, an increase of 7% over last year's first half.  Excluding the impact of the current-year gain related to the collection of indemnification proceeds as well as last year's First Technology gain and reduction of prior-year tax reserves, net income increased 18% and 19% for the second quarter and first half, respectively.  Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2007 was $692 million, 6% higher than last year. Gross capital expenditures year-to-date increased to $70 million, representing a 19% increase over the first half of last year. Our current full-year estimate remains at approximately $175 million to $200 million.  Second-quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, increased 17% over the same period last year. Free cash flow for the first half was $621 million, representing a 5% increase as compared to 2006, despite approximately $140 million in additional income tax payments in the first half of this year. Our free cash to net income conversion ratio for the first six months of 2007 was 110%.  For the year, we remain solidly on track to deliver free cash in excess of net income for what would be our 16th year in a row. Our balance sheet remains solid with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 23% and $175 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter's end.  Let me turn now to the operating performance in the quarter and start with our professional instrumentation segment, where revenues were up 14.5% for the quarter to $820 million. Revenues from existing businesses grew 8.5%. For the first half of 2007, revenues were up 13% to 1.6 billion. Revenues from existing businesses increased 7%.  Operating margins for the quarter were 23.2%, down 60 basis points versus a very strong prior-year performance. The prior-year gain from the collection of previously written-off receivables negatively impacted margin comparisons by 60 basis points, while the dilutive effect of acquisitions and the impact of prior-year real estate gains impacted margins by an additional 40 basis points. Absent these items, operating margins improved approximately 40 basis points in the quarter.  Year-to-date, operating margins decreased 20 basis points to 21.4%, when compared to 2006, due to the same factors. Absent those items, operating margins for the first half also improved approximately 40 basis points.  Environmental revenues for the quarter were strong, up 11.5% with core revenues growing 8.5%. For the first half, sales are up 10% with core revenues growing 6.5%. Water quality core revenues grew at a double-digit rate in the second quarter, a result of broad-based strength in both our lab and process products lines.  Geographically, Asia was up over 20%, Europe was up double digits, and North America was up at a high single-digit rate. During the quarter, we acquired Zulich (ph), a $10 million Switzerland-based company that provides measurement instrumentation used by the beverage industry for drinking and wastewater applications.  Sales in our water treatment business were up more than 20% in the quarter, led by a strong performance in the municipal wastewater market here in the US. During the quarter, Trojan won three new significant wastewater purification tenders in Australia, which represent more than $10 million of future revenue that are scheduled for delivery over the next year.  Subsequent to the second quarter, we completed our acquisition of ChemTreat. ChemTreat is a $200 million leading provider of water treatment solutions for commercial and industrial applications, which nicely complements our existing water treatment offering and brings with it an attractive consumables and service business mix. We are obviously very pleased to have ChemTreat and the ChemTreat team with Danaher today.  Moving over to Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, driven by healthy dispenser sales in the US and Mexico, as well as demand for our recently launched air quality products. Sales of our Veeder-Root monitoring systems were up double digits, reflecting strong international demand.  Moving over to electronic test. Revenues grew 20% in the quarter with core revenues up 10%. Sales increased 19% in the first half with core revenues up 9% over the same period. New product introductions in thermography, power quality and precision measurement contributed to the high single-digit growth rate that we saw at Fluke. Geographically, Europe and Asia were particularly robust, both up at mid-teens level during the quarter.  During the second quarter, Fluke introduced their new process clamp meter, a breakthrough tool, which provides preventative maintenance technicians the ability to measure and calibrate electrical current without having to disconnect or power-down the equipment they're working on, thereby, driving productivity and uptime. Shipments of this new clamp meter have significantly exceeded initial expectations and have been a key driver to our mid-teens -- excuse me -- high-teens growth during the quarter.  In June, we acquired Ircon Group, a $15 million designer and manufacturer of infrared temperature measurement and fixed thermal imaging products utilized for quality-assurance applications. The acquisition of Ircon further enhances Fluke's leading position in both temperature and thermal imaging instrumentation.  Fluke Networks' core revenue increased at a mid-teens rate, driven by copper and fiber certification products and by strength in both Europe and in North America. During the quarter, Fluke Networks received a multimillion-dollar order from a major US telecommunications service provider to facilitate their deployment of voice, video and data services. Also during the quarter, Fluke Networks received the AT&T Key Supplier Recognition Awards.  Moving to med-tech. Revenues for the quarter were up 38% to $707 million. Core revenues up 7% in the quarter contributed to the growth. Year-to-date, sales were up 54% to approximately 1.4 billion with core revenues growing 7.5%.  Med-tech operating margins for the quarter were 11.1%, 260 basis points higher than the same period last year. This performance was driven by core margin improvement of 95 basis points as well as the year-over-year impact from inventory charges associated with the acquisition of Sybron, which accounted for approximately 190 basis points of the increase.  Op margins for the first half increased 340 basis points to 11.8% as compared to the first half of last year, a result of the same items as well as the higher margins of recently acquired businesses, particularly Sybron. Year-to-date, core margins improved 85 basis points.  Core revenues in our dental business grew at a low single-digit rate for the quarter. Our consumables business, principally Sybron, grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by demand in both Europe and Asia, while the US benefited from double-digit growth in our Damon orthodontics product line, which I now proudly wear myself.  Dental equipment revenues were essentially flat in the quarter as a strong US performance in imaging and treatment units was offset by a softer European market. Asia revenues declined in the quarter due to a tough year-over-year comparison, primarily the result of a large Korean program that shipped in the prior year and did not reoccur.  Radiometer core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the second quarter, driven by double-digit instrument placement growth, primarily in our high-end ABL800 line. These instrument places, as many of you know, help generate additional high-margin consumables sales in future years.  Leica Microsystems' core revenues grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, driven by demand for both our microscopy and pathology diagnostic products. Increased research spending in North America in addition to increased sales resources in Europe were the key contributors to this exceptional mid-teens core growth performance in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.  Last month, we introduced the SEM 1000, the first in vivo imaging system enabling researchers to view microscopic images of cells and tissue within small living animals, utilizing fiber optics. This is a breakthrough technology, which provides access to virtually any space in the living animal, generating high-speed recordings of cellular and vascular events critical to drug discovery research.  We also recently announced the establishment of Leica Biosystems, the combination of our Vision BioSystems and Leica pathology diagnostics businesses. Sales force integration activities have been very successful to date with cross-selling synergies driving record sales of our Peloris branded tissue processors during the quarter. Revenue growth compared to prior-year periods we envision with a standalone company continues to be robust, up over 20% in the quarter.  Moving to industrial technologies. Revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $831 million. Revenues from existing businesses were up 1.5%. For the first half, revenues grew 5.5% to approximately $1.6 billion. Revenues from existing businesses grew 1.5%.  Operating margins for the quarter were 18.4%, a 320-basis-point improvement versus the same period last year. Core margins improved 135 basis points, while the gain arising from the collection of indemnification proceeds related to the Accu-Sort litigation contributed 155 basis points. Year-to-date, operating margins increased over 210 basis points to 17%, as core margins improved by 110 basis points.  Product identification revenues decreased one-half of 1% during the quarter with core revenues contributing 3.5% of the decline. Sales for the non-US Postal Service marketing business grew at a high single-digit rate, reflecting very healthy demand for equipment across all major geographies.  As we've previously discussed, core revenues for the first half were negatively impacted by several large USPS programs in the first half of '06, which did not reoccur this year. Sales were flat for the first half with core revenues decreasing 4.5%.  Videojet core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate during the quarter. Continued strength in equipment sales, including laser and CIJ offerings, as well as high single-digit growth in consumables were the primary contributors to this performance.  During the quarter, Videojet launched a new thermal transfer overprinter, or TTO. The new 6210 provides a digital solution for clocking (ph) variable data, including lot and date codes on flexible food packaging, such as foil bags for pretzels or potato chips. The 6210 improves print quality and increases uptime and is aimed at the emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil.  Moving over to motion. Revenues were flat in the quarter with core revenues declining 2.5%. In the first half, sales are up 2.5% with core revenues declining one-half of 1%. The strength in our elevator, electric vehicle, and aerospace and defense initiatives, as well as demand for our custom motors business was offset by weaker tech markets.  Revenue declines in these tech markets negatively impacted organic growth by more than 500 basis points in the quarter. We continue to make progress with our cost-reduction and pricing initiatives in Motion, as operating margins improved compared to the same period a year ago, despite the decline in revenues.  Turning to tools and components. Total revenue was $314 million for the quarter with core revenues declining 2%. For the first half, revenues were $635 million with core revenues decreasing 1.5%.  Operating margins for the quarter were 13.9%, a decrease of 80 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to lower production levels related to the impact of emission regulations on our Jacobs Vehicle Systems businesses as well as increased material and production costs in our US operation.  Previously implemented cost actions have mitigated margin declines despite lower revenues in the quarter. Year-to-date, operating margins decreased approximately 110 basis points to 12.5% compared to 2006. Margins were negatively impacted in the quarter, primarily due to these same factors.  Mechanics hand tools revenues decreased one half of 1% during the quarter, and for the first half sales, are up 1%, all of which is core revenue growth.  Double-digit growth at Lowe's with our Craftsman industrial initiative and in our Asia business partially offset a double-digit revenue decline at Sears in the quarter. The revenue decline at Sears Holdings was primarily due to their inventory reduction efforts and relatively flat sell-through.  Matco revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. The loss of Matco’s new toolbox product line earlier in the year generated sequential sales momentum through the second quarter with June revenues in toolboxes up at a low double-digit rate.  As Andy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell our power-quality business to Thomas & Betts. Upon closing, the purchase price is expected to result in an estimated gain of $150 million or approximately $0.46 per share.  Finally, during the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an average price of $71.50 for a total spend of about $117 million. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year. The majority of the difficult first-half comparisons are now behind us. As we go forward to the remainder of 2007, we remain confident that we will deliver on our growth and profitability expectations for the year, and we continue to see strength across the majority of the portfolio.  We expect our earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.97. And we are increasing our full-year earnings per share guidance from $3.70 to $3.80 to a new range of $3.74 to $3.82, up 16 to 18% versus last year.  It's important to note that both of these ranges exclude the second quarter gain related to the previously mentioned indemnification proceeds, as well as the estimated gain related to our sale of Power Quality. However, it does include approximately 1-end per share of dilution in each of the third and fourth quarters related to the divestiture of Power Quality. 
Andy Wilson: Thank you, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. Matt, we are now ready for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll go first to Bob Cornell with Lehman Brothers. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Yes, you know the quarter shows that the more disclosure you make, the more questions you get, right? 
Dan Comas: That's the downside. 
Larry Culp: There is a correlation, Bob. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Yes. You know, I guess my first question is how about the drag in Motion from tech? I mean you have the 500 basis points. What's that going to look like in the third quarter and the fourth quarter? When do we anniversary those issues? 
Larry Culp: Well, we're looking at the second half, Bob and frankly, at this point, I think taking a fairly conservative posture. You know, we had anticipated that we would see sequential improvement in tech. I think, right now, we're not expecting to see particular strengthening in those various markets, those end markets in the third quarter and, frankly, not hoping for anything miraculous to occur in the fourth quarter.  So I think, right now, we are thinking that rebound, at least from a planning perspective, is more of an '08 phenomenon than a second half '07 story. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Yes, you didn't reiterate your organic growth guidance for the year. Is there a comment there in the context of that first comment in the aggregate quarter result? 
Larry Culp: Sure, Bob, I didn't mean to omit that. I think that, as we said in December and have said all along this year, we think we will do 5% plus. I think the math, given what we've done in the first half, particularly on the back of the guidance raise here this morning, suggests we are looking at a back half at 6% plus.  And given where we are today with the portfolio, I think with the economic conditions being as strong as they are, let alone what we are seeing from our I2E and DBS initiatives, we feel very good about the second half, both topline and bottom line. And that's with, obviously, the dilution we mentioned coming out of the Power Quality sale. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Yes, I guess my final question is, with the third quarter guidance and the full-year guidance, I mean, it looks like you got a little bit of a disproportional split between third quarter and fourth quarter. Is that the right way to think about this? Maybe what are the reasons for that? 
Dan Comas: Well, if you look at the old high-end of 380 and you take $0.02 out of that for the dilution from Power in the second half, you're looking at going from 378 on the high end to 382.  It's probably looking at a penny increase coming out of Q2, a penny coming out of Q3, and probably $0.02 coming out of Q4. So you are right. A little bit of what we're seeing right now is a little more upside here in Q4. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: A little more upside you said, Dan? 
Dan Comas: Yes, well, I mean, kind of the net 4-cent increase, about 2-cent of that coming in the fourth quarter, though that, if you look at the math, would be kind of a similar growth rate in earnings to what we've had all along. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: I guess one final comment from me is that, in my model anyway -- and maybe it's just me -- the Medtech earnings second quarter over first quarter look a little unusual. You would expect those to be sequentially higher. I mean, is there a thought there? Are we looking at a new seasonal pattern? 
Dan Comas: Well, I think that Q2 is a little seasonally weaker in that sector. I think the margins were hurt a little bit by the fact that dental equipment was flat, topline, in the second quarter.  So as we talked about, the core margin improvement in Q2 in Medtech was actually a little more than it was in Q1. But I think it's in seasonal patterns. You should see a pretty significant increase sequentially, Q2 to Q3, here in Medtech, and then another increase from Q3 to Q4. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thanks very much, guys. 
Larry Culp: Bob, I would just add to that. We certainly saw in dental equipment during the quarter the opportunity to step-up some of our go-to-market investments, particularly in the developing markets.  And we also saw an increase in some of our growth break through spending around three particular new product initiatives, which obviously have out-year potential, which created some of that dynamic that you're pointing at as well. 
Bob Cornell - Lehman Brothers: I would love to see it. Thank you very much. 
Dan Comas: Thanks Bob. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. 
Dan Comas: Hi Deane. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Two questions, the first is, could you comment broadly on the M&A pipeline, pricing, and what expectations for transactions out the next several quarters? And then the second question I'd like to come back to is some specifics on the ChemTreat, so talk about M&A first, please. 
Larry Culp: Sure, Deane, good morning. Let me take that. I think the M&A environment that we see today continues to be very positive. And you've heard us say that we couldn't be busier, given the review Dan and I had with the team just yesterday. I think that description is still very much the order of the day. And I think you should expect us to continue to be active acquirers here in the second half of '07.  Obviously, we're going to continue to target transactions around our four platforms that have seen the bulk of the investment and the growth. Obviously, Medtech, Environmental, certainly electronic test and product ID all have very active deal pipelines working right now. And frankly, there is some interesting situations that we're looking at around some of our stronger niche businesses that might be good additions for us later on here in the year. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: It's interesting that one of your comments that you're not making is some of the competition with private equity or pricing. How about those two factors? 
Larry Culp: Well, I think we've had the view for some time that obviously there is a lot of private equity money out there with some smart people looking to put it to work. They tend, I think, on balance, to focus on properties that aren't necessarily high on our list.  And when we take the long view -- because we're building businesses and we're not buying to sell -- when we look at our synergies and the other things that we would bring to a transaction, we tend to see, frankly, other strategics as really the relevant competitive set, much more so than private equity. Not that they won't be there, but we find they, more often than not, are going to set a floor in a process as opposed to be a finalist with the company like Danaher, particularly around properties that we covet. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Good. And this is a good segue into a question on ChemTreat. And one of the obvious benefits here is you're broadening out your offerings in water, but you're also noticeably moving down the technology scale away from water test and UV water treatment.  So is this more a reflection of your interest in broadening out the offering, or is it very expensive at the high-end scale between filtration, ultra filtration and so forth? 
Larry Culp: Deane, I think you should look at ChemTreat as a classic Danaher water-quality transaction. I think we've thought for over a decade -- and remember, we got started to in water back in the mid-90s. That -- there isn't a single water market, but the market is made up of a number of segments and niches, some of which we think are highly attractive, others not so much. And what we've done with Hach/Lange and what we've done with Trojan is target the segments where we see good growth, and good margin potential.  And I think, with ChemTreat, what you see us do is really building out a portfolio in water treatment, a business here that has been a very high grower with very healthy operating margins. And we see that runway, both domestically and internationally, very much intact.  Now, obviously, as a related business, they will be able to do some things with Trojan, which I think will help both businesses. And the same will apply to Hach/Lange, particularly outside of the US. But you shouldn't look at ChemTreat, as anything other than a continuation of Danaher targeting the attractive segments in the water space. 
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Great. And just to clarify your comment on ChemTreat, where you mentioned the consumables, this is much more than a chemical business. Isn't it more of a solutions business? 
Larry Culp: Very much so. At the end of the day, what we really are helping our customers, primarily in their boiler and cooler operations with, is solve the operational challenges that water in the system can create. Whether we're talking about bacteria or scaling or corrosion, those sorts of things. And we think the due diligence and certainly their own results have proved this out, that the ChemTreat team does a superior job in providing those solutions to their customers. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse. 
Andy - Credit Suisse: Good morning guys. It’s actually Andy on behalf of Nicole. 
Larry Culp: Good morning, Andy. 
Andy - Credit Suisse: Good morning. I was just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing in the global growth environment, and how you see that going forward. 
Larry Culp: I think we look around the globe, Andy, and see our markets is particularly strong. And certainly, as we look to Europe, we look throughout Asia-Pac, Latin America, we just look at those spaces, particularly in our larger, and more global platforms, as target rich environments, both for organic growth and, frankly, for M&A. So, we have no complaints about the macro environment right now. 
Andy - Credit Suisse: Thank you very much. 
Operator: We’ll go to John Inch with Merrill Lynch. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, and good morning. 
Larry Culp: Good morning John. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Hi. Hey, just to start off, I think someone may have been out there suggesting 5% organic growth this quarter was an important threshold. Given the tough comps in Motion, I thought the 4.5 you did was very consistent, if not better than the way you had laid out expectations. So, my first question is am I missing something, or were you actually thinking you might be able to hit 5% this quarter? 
Larry Culp: I think what we were flagging all along, John, was that we would do sequentially better than we did in the first quarter. And we think we delivered on that. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Larry, the sale or proposed sale of Power Quality, you guys haven't divested sort of on scale for quite awhile. Does this represent some kind of strategic shift in the way you're sort of thinking about portfolio management?  And I’ll tell you where I'm going with this. Specifically, I'm just thinking of Motion, and really how that business fits the long-term kind of company that you're trying to build. 
Larry Culp: John, I think, that if you look at the quarter, you're looking at the Power Quality divestiture. I think you should look at that in concert with the opportunistic buyback, in concert with the business we were just talking about with Deane coming in, ChemTreat. It's really great examples of how we've always approached, and always will approach capital allocation in a very strategic, very disciplined way.  So we looked at Power Quality, as we've discussed, a business that could have been larger with Danaher if a couple of transactions over time had occurred. They didn't. This is a business that was more valuable to other strategics than ourselves. And obviously, at this point in the cycle, a timely time to see those businesses off. By the same token, we were able to take advantage of a low stock price during the quarter, during a very limited window for us, and put capital to work in the buyback, however modest.  But obviously, looking to continue to build, both organically and inorganically and you see that with ChemTreat. So I'd like to think that what you have in the second quarter are a number of examples of Danaher doing what it has always done, running the plays that have worked for us, that have created value for shareholders over a long period of time.  And that's, frankly, the playbook we're going to run in the second half of '07 and the one we're going to use going forward in '08 and beyond. Will there be other divestitures? You can never rule that out. I think we've said, in trying to flag or to foreshadow what would happen with Power Quality, that this would be the year in which you might see us prune at a little more of an active rate. Obviously, you see the transaction on the table. Is there more pruning to come? I wouldn't rule it out. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Okay. But the timing of Power Quality in the second quarter, was that -- I mean maybe Dan can answer this. Is it just because that's the way the strap plan, sort of ultimately culminated in the decision, or were there something that you started at the year, Larry, and said we're just going to get a lot more aggressive in terms of trying to prune the portfolio, and this is sort of what fell out of that analysis? 
Dan Comas: I think we’re very sensitive to when other companies talk to us about their interests in some of our businesses. And I think, given the environment, we felt it was a very opportune time to sell the business. There wasn't a specific decision made a year ago. We're trying to add value and try to recognize when there are strategic buyers that really come forward with a great deal of interest. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: No, that's fair. One more quick one. So Roche is proposing to acquire Ventana. It looks like it would represent a substantial premium to what you guys actually paid for Vision.  So Larry, does this dynamic perhaps open some new possible M&A doors for you in terms of -- I'm thinking of sort of new possibilities in the market, given the market's tolerance for what appears to be higher multiples for these types of properties, versus sort of what Danaher has traditionally paid for some of its businesses, particularly as you build out your medical platform over time? 
Larry Culp: Well, I think we would -- again, we’re trying to stay smart and stay disciplined. Obviously, the price being contemplated for that transaction, putting multiples aside is probably petty cash at Roche. It would be a significant situation, much more significant for us.  But John, I was in San Diego earlier this week at the Clinical Chemistry show, obviously a market undergoing great, great change even with the aborted GE/Abbott transaction, lots of companies there with new flagship brands on the boost. And I think our strategy really, in diagnostics, will continue to be a focused one. You see what we've done in acute care with Radiometer.  Obviously, we focused on the tissue-base, the histology, pathology laboratory with Leica and Vision, and obviously with the price is being talked about for Ventana, our pricing on vision looks very attractive today. I think, as I talk to customers to show doctors are very demanding.  And our focused strategy aimed at trying to meet their needs around accuracy or reliability with the instrumentation, workflow solutions, let alone doctor and nurse safety, is a strategy that's going to work very well. We had a couple of new products that we were unveiling, some publicly, some quietly, particularly Radiometer, which seemed to generate a lot interest, at least in the showings where I was. And I think what you'll see us do is continue to grow those businesses inorganically and complement that with smart acquisitions, not deviating wildly from our financial discipline. 
John Inch - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. 
Dan Comas: Thanks, John. 
Larry Culp: Thank you, John. 
Operator: We will go next to Jeff Sprague with Citi. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. 
Dan Comas: Good morning, Jeff. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: Just a couple of things. First on, Larry, you noted the strength in the community water business. Is there some change and just kind of disbursement of funds or something going on or that market has been in kind of fits and starts lately? 
Larry Culp: Yeah. I think that’s a good characterization, Jeff. I think we've had a number of projects here of late that have finally begun to be installed. I think that's what you're seeing is a pipeline that has been building, as you say in fits and starts, finally coming to reality. We're going to have a very good year at Trojan, domestically in particular. 
Dan Comas: And I think what was encouraging is that we’re pretty confident, based on our wins last year, that the topline at Trojan would be real strong this year, but we were worried about the order book kind of going into '08, '09, and that's been very good as well. So, not only I think we are well positioned in topline this year, but going into '08 and '09 as well. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: And then on Medtech, Dan, just to understand what you were saying to Bob Cornell's question, that acceleration you were talking about -- is that a margin comment or was that a topline comment? 
Dan Comas: It was primarily a margin comment. You know, the segment grew high single digits, both in the first and second quarter. We think that sort of growth rate will continue. My guess is it will -- Leica won't sustain in the mid teens but will continue to grow quite nicely while the dental equipment, which was, as you mentioned, was flatter in the second quarter, will accelerate. So kind of net-net kind of keep us in those high single digit growth rates, but with an improvement in margins. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: Then I'm just trying to understand what was going on in dental, because obviously the 7% growth is not shabby but it's a deceleration from Q1 against what looks like an easier comp. I think Sybron actually rolled in, at least for a month, into your organic. Is there something with reimbursements or some other dynamic that's going on in Dental? I think Larry mentioned the Korea thing. Was that really big enough to matter substantially? 
Larry Culp: Jeff, yes, I think, if you break it down from a geographic perspective, the US was strong, particularly in imaging, where we were up over 20%. Europe was softer, I think, than anybody expected on the equipment side, quite honestly. We had the big IDS show in March.  We tend to see a good tale coming out of that show. It looks like Europe is really going to be more of a second-half story. We have seen, I think, a very encouraging order book here the last four or five weeks, which bodes well for the second half. Asia, particularly Korea, given it was a large basically one-time program over there, did create a bit of a tougher comp in that regard.  So, you roll that all up, not the best quarter dental equipment will ever put up, but I think we look at those geographic dynamics and again feel better about the second half and have already begun to see the start of some of that acceleration sequentially. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: And then just one last one, Dan, you had this big lump of cash taxes in H1. Is that behind you? Was there anything unusual? Is that just kind of timing or was it… 
Dan Comas: It is timing. You know, as you know, it's quite unusual that our cash taxes equal our provision, as it was in the first half, and that is an anomaly. You know, we have flagged that our cash tax rate would increase over time, but it's not going to equal our provision this year. So you'll see relatively lower tax payments here in the second half. 
Jeff Sprague - Citigroup: Thank you very much. 
Dan Comas: Thank you Jeff. 
Operator: And we’ll go to Ann Duignan, Bear Stearns. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: Hi, good morning. 
Dan Comas: Good morning Ann. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: I might know the answer to why your dental business was weaker than you expected in Germany. Currently, 100,000 dentists in Germany have ownership in biodiesel plants and they're not making much money right now, so maybe that's your answer? 
Larry Culp: I will use that next time, Ann. Thank you. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: Yes, it all comes back to ethanol or biodiesel issues. My questions run the same, the same issue. You did note that life science instruments in Leica Microsystems was strong in Europe. Can you just compare and contrast what you think was going on in dental versus what you think was going on in Leica in Europe? 
Larry Culp: Well, again, I think the independent dentist, the spending psychology is different than the more corporate and more institutional spending that we see, both on the research and on the clinical side at Leica. That's a worldwide phenomena. I think we saw a first half, whether it was their biodiesel investments or some other considerations.  Dennis in Germany particularly, we saw the UK a little bit soft as well, not spending in the way we would've thought in the first half, but again feel like things are picking up as we speak.  We've had a very good run with Leica and are optimistic that, as Dan says, it will probably slow a bit sequentially but still be very healthy, very healthy growth rates there, because of the spending, again both from a research and from a clinical perspective. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: Okay, thank you. Just on pricing, you noted the pricing contributed in both the industrial technologies and tools and components. But what's the pricing environment like in the other businesses, or at least, again, could you compare and contrast maybe pricing in the US versus pricing outside of the US? 
Dan Comas: Ann, the price we've been getting kind of between 1.5 and 2 points the last six or seven quarters has been pretty consistent. Both within the professional instrumentation and Medtech businesses we continue to get it, particularly in the consumable businesses, the consumable pieces of those businesses.  So they're probably -- they obviously don't have quite the raw materials to offset that we do in tools and Motion, so it's probably a little bit less than a 1.5 points across those segments. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: Okay. Then the other businesses, or just in general, - are you seeing the ability to increase prices better in the US versus the rest of world, or vice versa? 
Dan Comas: I think, on the equipment side, it's easier in the US I think, its on the consumables piece, we get in both regions. 
Ann Duignan - Bear Stearns: Okay. That’s quite helpful. Thank you. 
Dan Comas: Thank you Ann. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Stephen Tusa with JP Morgan. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: Good morning. On the product ID business, a pretty good result in the core business there, and I know Domino is talking about some pretty positive market trends. Could you just comment on the market there and what you are seeing, and any opportunities with all this news around the track and trace from China, that kind of opportunity with, being a little bit more on top of imports coming in with, you know -- the track and trace opportunity internationally? 
Larry Culp: Sure. Well, I think maybe two comments, Steve. First of all, this in terms of the core coding and marking businesses, as you said, we think we're doing very well against a backdrop that suggests healthy market demand. And we would say that is a worldwide phenomena right now.  I think we're very pleased with the performance we've seen out of Videojet in the first half, as they have built sequentially strength in the core business, obviously camouflaged a bit because of the tough comps with the low-margin USPS programs that didn't repeat this year. With respect to track and trace, let's just step back for a moment.  We love this business because there are a number of application trends like track and trace, like product safety, supply chain efficiency and the like, where we can really help the Unilevers, the Nestles, the Pepsis, the Procters of the world tackle those challenges. I think what's happened recently around product safety and counterfeiting -- that plays very well both to the core products and the core applications that we serve today, as well as some of the newer opportunities out there, like track and trace.  So we remain very bullish, both inorganically as well as organically, around these opportunities. Recent headlines help, but I think the undercurrent has been there for some time. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: Then on the guidance, I'm just -- sorry, I might have missed this. But what is included in that guidance? Is the 2-cent gain from this quarter included in that guidance, but the dilution from the deal? 
Dan Comas: Yes, the $0.02 gain is not in the guidance. The $0.02 we're going to have dilution from Power, which we have just gotten regulatory approval and the transaction will close in the next, in the coming days. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: Okay. 
Dan Comas: That $0.02 of dilution is in the guidance. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: I got you. Then, did you put out a core growth number? Did you kind of reaffirm the 5%-plus for the year? Is that what you did on core growth? 
Dan Comas: Larry did that in the Q&A earlier. 
Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan: Okay. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you. 
Dan Comas: Thank you, Steve. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Robert LaGaipa with CIBC World Markets. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: Hi. Good morning. Just a few questions -- I guess, one, with the 5%-plus core growth, can you just talk about the composition of that and how that's changed in terms of your expectations moving forward?  I think you had mentioned earlier, you know, tax being a little bit more conservative on that end. You mentioned the acceleration in dental on the Medtech side. Any other changes in terms of the composition we should be looking for? 
Larry Culp: Well, I think, if you just go around the more than professional instrumentation I think has been growing at a high single digit rate here. That continues with both engines, both test and environmental are inspiring nice and well. Obviously, at Medtech we've alluded to, I think, continued strength in aggregate with a bit of a mix shift with a slight sequential slowing at Leica off some white-hot numbers. And we would expect, as I mentioned on the last call, to see the dental equipment business in the second half pick-up.  We would look at I think industrial tech is also improving sequentially during the second half, though obviously our expectations, as I indicated to Bob Cornell, are modest in the Motion businesses. And tools and components again, I think there we will see sequential improvement and are optimistic, particularly as we get closer to the holidays, that we will see improvement in mechanics and tools, particularly. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: Specific to tools and components, what gives you that level of optimism moving forward? Obviously, in light of Sears and in light of big-box stores, etcetera, are you more optimistic on the sales end of things, or are you more optimistic on the margins moving forward? 
Larry Culp: Well, we can and should improve the margins in tools. That's more in our control, volume being somewhat stable. I think, as we see what works and what doesn't at retail and in the industrial channels and tools, we learn a little bit more each quarter and obviously are optimistic, assuming no change in the economic conditions, that we can improve our performance sequentially at the top line, as we get into the second half. 
Dan Comas: Bob, just back on your first question on the sequential improvement in growth. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: Sure. 
Dan Comas: Just the absence of these comp issues, if everything else stayed the same of what we did in Q2, we would be right around 6% in Q3. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: All right. Okay. 
Dan Comas: So, we don't need an acceleration of Motion to get to that level, if everything else stays the same and just the last thing is some of the comp issues. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: Right. And with regard to tools margins, are you speaking sequentially improvement or do you think there's a possibility that you can actually get higher year-over-year margins in the back half, in tools? 
Larry Culp: Well, we're going to continue to struggle. Jake Brake will be down every quarter this year, won't be down as much in the second half as it was in the first half, so in terms of the total segment, we will probably continue to be down. We are fighting some headwinds in the commodity side in the tool business, which we are largely offsetting but not entirely. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: I got you. Lastly, just a clarification -- just with regard to the core growth, I noticed that, we noticed that in professional instrumentation, I mean, obviously a consistent environmental and electronic test, but you mentioned the core growth in professional instrumentation being 8.5%, but environmental 8.5 and electronic test at 10. So I would think that that number would be a little bit higher. What am I missing there? 
Larry Culp: Electronic test is just under 10, and environmental was just over 8, so kind of blending two, and with a little bit more weight on environmental gets you to that. 
Robert LaGaipa - CIBC World Markets: I got you. Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Kotowicz, AG Edwards. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Hey, good morning, guys. 
Larry Culp: Good morning Chris. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Larry, we all know that you bought Sybron to have better access to products for your company dental plan. 
Larry Culp: Well, call it my Victory call at moment. I'm learning a lot, let me tell you. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: The core growth, I will take it maybe a different angle. How much of the second-half strength would you break out as easier comparisons versus orders in hand, right? You mentioned Trojan has got a pretty good backlog and looks good into the second half. Some of your other businesses maybe have the same. Could you kind of give us a sense of how much of that you can see pretty tangibly versus just kind of an expectation? 
Larry Culp: Well, I think, if you look around our business, Chris, as you know, we don't have a long list of businesses that stack up the backlog several quarters in advance. I think the optimism we have about our performance here and to come in the second half is really a function of the momentum we have in many businesses, a view that the economic environment will continue to stay positive and helpful.  And I think a recognition that is we have stepped up our sales and marketing a new product introductions, that we'll continue to, on-balance, see contributions from those investments.  We could break it down business by business, but again we don't carry a lot of backlog into the second half here that guarantees us that 6% plus we have to go make that happen, but are confident we can, given what we see right now. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Okay. And then maybe geographically, Europe and Asia have been really strong for a lot of companies. In the absence of that, I think we have a very different reaction to the industrial sector, just given what's going on in North America. What are you guys seeing?  Are you seeing more growth in Europe, in particular relative to North America on a core sales standpoint, or are your businesses really isolated from that, given the platforms that you have? 
Dan Comas: We are seeing good strength in Europe. Europe grew kind of high single-digit rate in the second quarter. China, almost all of our businesses were up kind of mid teens in China.  In the US, if you kind of adjust for postal, I think we highlighted that we adjusted for postal grew up just grew slightly in the first quarter, but grew a little faster here in the second quarter. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Okay. So maybe some acceleration there and then maybe just a clarification, because I thought I heard Larry say, Vision Systems was up 20% in the quarter, year-over-year? 
Larry Culp: I know that's correct. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Okay. I just wanted to be sure I had it right. 
Dan Comas: Yes, they are performing very well. 
Larry Culp: Thanks, Chris. 
Chris Kotowicz - AG Edwards: Bye-bye. 
Operator: And we’ll take our final question from Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yeah, good morning. 
Dan Comas: Hi Ajit. 
Larry Culp: Good morning. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Two quick questions, if I may? The first is you mentioned the growth in China, could you give us some color as to, in this quarter, what the percentage of overall sales was from China and then overall from Asia?  And the second question would be just your balance sheet, you know we had some pretty solid cash flows here. You know, the pace of acquisitions has been fairly moderate, and a number of companies have been opportunistic in raising debt in an environment like this.  So could you give us some color as to how you're thinking about leveraging your balance sheet, and potentially how you prioritize potential uses for cash right now in terms of acquisitions, dividends, potentially a buyback? And yes, those two. 
Dan Comas: Maybe, Ajit, on the second point, I think, as an A plus rated company, we've got a lot of capacity here and we are clearly spending a lot -- as Larry mentioned earlier in the call, we are spending a lot of time looking at acquisitions and think that our balance sheet has a lot of capacity to take on additional leverage without impacting our credit rating.  So I don't, given our access to commercial paper, I don't think we feel the need to go out and lock in some long-term debt but we’re clearly spending the time looking to deploy more capital here. 
Larry Culp: And again, I think, Ajit, we would, at this point, be rather optimistic that we will make some meaningful moves here in the second half of 2007. I mean, you never can forecast that, but again, given the activity level, given the pipeline that we reviewed just yesterday, and we feel pretty good in the regard about what could happen here in the back half. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: I got it. And then, on Asia and China, the percentage of sales? 
Dan Comas: I think, in terms of the first question, growth, China was up mid-teens in the second quarter, for the full year looking to be $600 million, $700 million. And for the whole company, Ajit, I would have to get back to you with that number. 
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Thank you so much. 
Larry Culp: All right. Thanks Ajit. 
Dan Comas: Thank you. 
Operator: And with no other questions, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Wilson for any additional or closing comments. 
Andy Wilson: I want to thank everybody for joining us today. As a reminder, the replay number is 888-203-1112 with the confirmation code of 2914902. As always, Dan and I will be available for questions after the call. Thanks again. 
Operator: Again, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a good day.
