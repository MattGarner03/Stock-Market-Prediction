===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2025 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation also will be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Active results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s business, which are discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. I’m going to start with a usual update on financial performance for the quarter, and then provide perspectives on the market, including our understanding of the possible effects of recent U.S. government initiatives. How we are well positioned to navigate these near-term challenges and, finally, why we remain confident about the industry’s resilience and prospects. I’ll close by highlighting a few important wins in the first quarter. So let’s get started. We delivered strong revenue and profit results at the high-end of our expectations, despite a continued challenging environment in R&DS. Total revenue for the first quarter came in above the high-end of our guidance range, representing year-over-year growth of 2.5% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. And compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top-line about 4.5% on a constant currency basis, including about a couple of points of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4%. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70, increased 6.3% year-over-year. Let me share some details on the market landscape and the demand metrics we’re seeing for each segment. Starting with TAS. The business continued the strong recovery trend we saw exiting last year as our clients are launching new drugs and are executing on their commercial roadmaps. It is in times like these where there is some uncertainty in the biopharmaceutical sector that we clearly see the value of the scale, diversification, and differentiation of IQVIA’s portfolio offerings. It’s great that TAS is contributing over 40% of our revenue. TAS revenue growth actually came in above our expectations at 6.4% reported and 7.6% at constant currency led by double-digit growth in real-world evidence. On the clinical side, as we expected, the near-term market environment continues to be bumping, we experienced delayed decision-making by customers on new programs reflecting the heightened macroeconomic and industry sector caution. In fact, our average time from RFP issuance to award in the quarter increased by approximately 10% both year-over-year and sequentially. We believe that this is the result of the sector uncertainty caused by the pronouncements of the new administration. The precise effects of which are unknowable at this point. Several of our clients are slowing or reevaluating programmatic decisions until there is better visibility. Also reflecting these same concerns, the funding environment for EBTs, especially for early stage, has deteriorated. Why the R&DS business is experiencing some turbulence? Our demand metrics remain positive. Our backlog reached a new record of $31.5 billion at the end of the quarter, growing 4.8% compared to the prior year. Our first quarter RSP flow improved mid-single-digits year-over-year and high-single-digits sequentially. Our qualified pipeline is up low-single-digits year-over-year driven mostly by good growth in large pharma. Now, obviously, the demand environment is impacted by the proposed changes that have been signaled by the new U.S. administration. The White House’s initiatives relative to our industry sector can be grouped into three categories: tariffs; agency actions, particularly HHS and FDA-related; and drug pricing. Starting with tariffs, when the President announced plans to initiate the reciprocal tariff program, the pharmaceutical industry received certain exemptions. However, following the announcement, the Department of Commerce began a national security investigation of the life sciences industry, which may result in tariffs specific to the pharma sector. Now, IQVIA’s direct exposure to tariffs is limited primarily to certain supplies in our laboratory business and is immaterial financially. We understand that industry-specific tariffs, if implemented, may have a more direct impact on our customers. However, it is too early to assess what that impact may be. With respect to agency actions, HHS announced a number of initiatives, including NIH delays and cancellations of government contracts, along with establishing a 15% cap on indirect costs. Now, to be clear, IQVIA has no clinical trial contracts with BARDA and no COVID-19 contract sponsored by the government. So our exposure there is zero. That said, we have excellent relationships with these agencies, including BARDA, that does have a minimal amount of business with the government, and we do not expect any of these to have any impact at all. The NIH funding cap relates to indirect administrative and overhead costs. It aims at aligning those indirect costs to the same levels as private foundations. This has no impact on direct costs for research funding and, therefore, zero impact on us. Regarding the FDA, there have been numerous restructuring actions announced, which have impacted a significant portion of the workforce. These reductions in force primarily targeted overhead and support functions such as planning, training, travel, communications, and records management. Importantly, core products review teams responsible for evaluating new drugs, vaccines, and medical devices, which are primarily funded by the industry, were largely preserved to maintain the FDA’s essential regulatory functions. Today, we have no evidence of any trial or approval delays. Whatever anecdotal disruptions there may be in non-approval related interactions with FDA staff, we expect this to normalize. FDA Commissioner Makary has announced his intention to reduce animal testing in favor of AI-based models and enhance usage of real-world evidence in the approval process. We applaud this and we see these actions proposed by Commissioner Makary as belated in our industry. They will enable clients to move prospects faster into clinical trials. The increased use of real-world evidence not only in pre-clinical work, but also in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials plays to IQVIA strengths. Ultimately, this is positive news for EVP companies, which develop over 50% of the drugs in clinical trials. Finally, on drug pricing, the U.S. administration recently issued an executive order regarding the role of PBMs, pricing transparency and Medicare costs. These initiatives are still in their early stages and some provisions may require and rational approval. The impact of these potential actions is difficult to ascertain at this point because the specifics have not been determined, but there are two aspects that could actually be very positive for the industry. First, the proposal to do away with the so-called pill penalty provision in the IRA, which subjects small molecule drugs to CMS pricing review after only 9 years versus 13 years for large molecule drugs. This is key for pharma clients as 50%, 50% of the drug’s value is realized in years 9 to 13. Second, the focus on drug pricing treatment value and comparative effectiveness drives the need for earlier clinical results and more real-world evidence. So, in summary, some of our customers have slowed down their decision-making processes, as you would expect, and we experienced delays in RFPs moving to contracts in the first quarter. An unusually high number of EBP awards that were contracted in the quarter were not included in our bookings because funding had not been secured yet. Now, we are confident that our industry will successfully manage the spirit of uncertainty, and we’ll find ways to adapt. The life sciences industry has consistently demonstrated its resilience, overcoming macroeconomic obstacles, and thriving in changing environments, and IQVIA is particularly well-positioned to navigate its marketplace. We believe when everything is said and done, key decision makers will recognize the industry is a strategic sector for the U.S. that deserves to be strongly supported. U.S. companies in the biopharmaceutical sector have maintained strong global leadership in biomedical discovery and clinical research. Our sector serves as an extraordinary engine of innovation. It was responsible for 46% of the 634 novel drugs approved globally over the past decade, confirming strong U.S. leadership. The U.S. is responsible for 61% of global pharmaceutical sales of branded drugs, which is up from 56% a decade ago. The sector invests almost $200 billion annually in research and development and drives economic growth, contributing $1.65 trillion of economic output annually. It supports direct and indirect employment of highly skilled, highly educated workers and growing nearly 5 million people at an average of $157,000 annually, which is double the national average. In fact, many non-U.S. large pharma companies have moved their primary R&D centers to the U.S. to take advantage of the talent pool. And, of course, the biopharmaceutical industry provides substantial societal benefits by improving health outcomes and extending life expectancy. Now, before I turn it over to Ron, let me give you a little bit of color on business activity in the quarter, and I’ll be brief here and just mention a few salient examples. As the revenue numbers show, TAS did quite well in the quarter. We won a number of partnerships with clients that are launching new products. For example, the last project for an important EBP client that’s launching their first product and the first ever treatment for low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. We also won a launch partnership with another EBP leveraging our AI-powered patient-relationship manager platform for groundbreaking treatment for a rare condition in an underserved patient community. We were selected to support a mid-size pharma client with an omni-channel campaign that includes KPIs designed to improve patient engagement. Our commercial technology suite continues to be successful in the marketplace. Our award-winning SmartSolve offering, which is a proprietary quality management system displays the incumbent at an EBP client. In the MedTech space, we secured a significant contract to deploy an integrated information solution to help our clients stream our operations and decision-making. Let me skip a few more of these and move to R&DS. We achieved notable wins across customer segments. As you recall, last year, we renewed all 22 of our strategic partnerships with large pharma clients and we expanded the scope in half a dozen of them. We are being awarded significant contracts from these partnerships. For example, in the quarter, a top 5 pharma clients that have selected IQVIA as a preferred partner awarded us four early-stage studies under the new model. IQVIA was selected by a top 20 pharma client to support a Phase 3 obesity program across eight studies, our best-in-class clinical trial technology solutions, and industry-leading expertise were key factors in securing this deal. The top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA as pharma provision [ph] offerings to achieve a significant reduction in case processing time, enable efficiency, and manage the increasing volume. We secured a contract with an EBP client to run a Phase 2 trial for an innovative treatment for patients with positively hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. The customers selected IQVIA due to our deep technology expertise, delivery model, and partnership focused approach. Lastly, Mike mentioned our progress with AI. You may recall we announced our collaboration with NVIDIA earlier in the call. We are progressing as planned to deploy highly specialized industry AI agents. So far, we moved over 20 agents into production, covering three use cases in each of the commercial real-world in R&DS segments. We are seeing positive results and productivity gains in areas where these AI agents have been deployed. For example, one agentic system in commercial allows us to reduce delivery time by two-thirds, from 12 weeks to 4 weeks, with a net 30% cost reduction. We plan to scale up from these three use cases to 12 by the end of the second quarter, and 40 use cases by the end of the year. And, now to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let’s start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3,829 million, grew 2.5% on a reported basis, and 3.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, we had virtually no COVID-related revenue versus over $40 million in last year’s first quarter. Adjusting for this COVID step-down, constant currency growth was about 4.5%. As Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points of this growth than majority of this in the TAS segment. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1,546 million that was up 6.4% reported and 7.6% constant currency. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2,102 million, up 0.3% reported and 1.1% constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, R&DS revenue grew approximately 3% of constant currency. Finally, Contract sales & Medical Solutions first quarter revenue of $181 million, declined 4.2% reported and 2.1% at constant currency. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $883 million for the quarter, that was growth of 2.4% year-over-year. First quarter GAAP net income was $249 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.40. Adjusted net income was $479 million for the first quarter, up 2.4% year-over-year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6.3% to $2.70. R&DS backlog at March 31 was $31.5 billion, an increase of 4.8% year-over-year and 4.6% at constant currency. Next 12 months, revenue from this backlog is $7.9 billion. Reviewing the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,740 million and gross debt was $14,330 million, resulting in net debt of $12,590 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.40 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $568 million and CapEx was $142 million, resulting in strong free cash flow of $426 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of our shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.6 billion remaining under the current program. Okay. Let’s turn to guidance now. You saw we’re raising our full year revenue guidance by $275 million, this to reflect more favorable foreign currency exchange rates since with that guided. We now expect revenue to be between $16,000 million and $16,400 million, which represents year-over-year growth to 3.9% to 6.5% on a reported basis or 5.2% growth at the midpoint. This guidance now includes a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately 50 basis points compared to about 150 basis points at headwind in our previous guidance. We continue to assume approximately $100 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity for the full year. We are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3,765 million to $3,885 million, as FX changes had a negligible impact on EBITDA. This represents year-over-year growth of 2.2% to 5.5%. We’re also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $11.70 to $12.10, that’s up 5.1% to 8.7% versus the prior year, or 6.9% growth at midpoint. Now, let’s go through the second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.925 billion and $4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $895 million and $915 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $2.72 and $2.83. Both this guidance for the second quarter and our full year guidance assume that foreign currency rates as of May 5 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, in Q1, we delivered strong revenue and profit results at the high end of our expectations. We had a very solid free cash flow of 89% of adjusted net income. The TAS business continued to achieve above target performance with revenue growth at 7.6% at constant currency. And R&DS of bookings were affected by delayed decision-making by customers on new programs and lower EBP funding, reflecting incremental macroeconomic and the industry sector uncertainty. That said, forward-looking indicators for R&DS offerings such as qualified pipeline, RFP flow and backlog continue to grow. We’re progressing as planned to deploy new highly specialized industry AI agents, and we’ve identified over 40 use cases and scaled up deploying it across our portfolio in 2025. In the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of our shares. And, lastly, we raised our full year revenue guidance by $275 million to reflect changes in FX. And of course, we reaffirmed our past guidance. So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the session for questions-and-answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Justin Bowers at Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Ari, could you discuss some of the drivers behind the strength in RWE in the quarter, how the order book looks through the balance of the year, and whether or not this outperformance is durable?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Justin. Look, TAS delivers better than expected revenue growth, which is what helped the company deliver above the high-end of our guidance with 7.6% at constant currency. And as I mentioned, this was driven largely by the strong growth in real world, which was strong double-digits. This basically, you will recall, that real-world had declined, the part of real-world that discretionary had essentially shut down, and in the end of 2023, beginning of 2024, timeframe. And the rest of the real-world business, which is more mission critical, had been delayed and pushed to the right in terms of when to do it and so on. So both the discretionary piece and the required work that’s necessary to support safety or pricing, demonstrating the effectiveness of treatment, et cetera, both have returned. There’s pent-up demand, and we expect this based on the book of business to continue. The rest of TAS was also good, basically low- to mid-single-digits for the different other aspects of the business. Thank you, Justin.
Justin Bowers: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move next to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Sykes: Thanks for taking my question. Ron, just maybe on the margin side, I know you guys have called out in Q4, 20 basis point potential margin expansion. It looks like as you kind of rearrange the guide maybe not expecting that. Could you just maybe talk about the opportunities for any potential margin expansion and kind of what you could do on the cost side to help achieve that?
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. Well, one thing I would point out, Matt, when you’re looking at the margin versus our previous guidance, obviously, the impact of FX, because FX affects our top-line, but doesn’t have much impact on the bottom-line. And if you’re looking gross margins or EBITDA margins as the dollar is weak and revenue was going up, profit hasn’t followed. So that that really explains all the change in our implied margins versus what we guided to previously. Now, if you’re looking towards what can help drive margins going forward, it’s always cost reduction where AI would be one example that we’re looking at. We’re always looking at taking cost out across the organization. That’s an ongoing effort. You’ll see that in our restructuring expense. Of course, against that, we do have pressures on things like not just the FX, but mix has gone against us to a certain extent. You’ll see that in the gross margin. And, that mix includes, for instance, the shift towards FSP, which hurts margins a little bit. But net-net, the margin picture really hasn’t changed that much. What you’re seeing is mostly just the impact of FX, almost entirely.
Matthew Sykes: Got it. Thank you. And just for a follow-up, Ari, could you just maybe talk a little bit about on a longer term basis, you made a comment in Q3 regarding sort of the competitiveness of RFPs going from sort of one of 13 to one of 4, if I’ve got the numbers correctly. And just in this environment, given sort of lower levels of demand, how do you feel about your position? And do you think that vendor consolidation trend, which has already been in place, will accelerate in this environment?
Ari Bousbib: Are you talking about the R&DS business and RFP flow?
Matthew Sykes: Yes. R&DS specifically, yeah, and vendor consolidation.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Look, the RFP flow is actually pretty good given the environment. So the underlying demand is still there. We’re not seeing customers decide to no longer do certain programs. We went through a period of reviews and reprioritization of pipelines, which led to very elevated cancellations during the course of 2024, maybe 50% higher cancellation levels in 2024 than the historic norm. In the quarter, just I might mention, we had cancellations that were just in the normal historic range. So what happened in the quarter, we expect our booking is mostly, again, programs that clients decided to pause and wait to see what the actual consequences are of some of the administration’s pronouncements before they decide to go ahead. And separately, as you might have noted, there was deterioration in the funding for EBP. So, we had an unusually high number of EBP awards in the first quarter that were actually not only awards, but they were also contracted, but our policy is not to include those in bookings if we’re not confident in the fund or as long as we’re not 100% sure that the funding has been secured. Respect the RFP for though, it’s still very, very good. I mean, whether in we’ve seen consistent numbers in terms of whether it’s dollar value or volume, when our lead rates and hit rates are stable. So we’re not seeing any changes really in the flow of RFPs, whether the large pharma RFPs are up stronger than EBPs at this point. It’s pretty good actually and, sequentially, it’s high-single-digits, higher. So from that standpoint, I feel better at this point in the quarter than I did at the same point last quarter.
Mike Fedock: Yeah. And as we’ve mentioned previously, we did very well last year with renewing and expanding all the large pharma providerships that they went through, and we’re starting to see the benefits of those new RFPs from those relationships coming through.
Matthew Sykes: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Ari, I want to ask a little bit more just probing on the operating environment. Given the uncertainty what you saw in R&DS, I’m just surprised that you didn’t see that in more of the short cycle business in TAS. Like you kept the guidance and I guess the assumption is things are going to continue. But do you think that there’s risk that that could spill over into some of the uncertainty into some of those areas in TAS like consulting or some of the analytics or some of the areas like that? And could it potentially result in further reprioritization even in the R&DS business? If you give us your thoughts on those things.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I mean, you got to start when you’re asking the question. There’s considerable uncertainty out there. And whenever you have uncertainty, then obviously, people are hesitant to spend money. That’s a general rule, and that’s the concern out there. But so far, we haven’t seen that in TAS. All of our indicators, leading indicators, pipeline, decision timelines and so on continue to be strong. I believe that the reason we haven’t seen that is because there were pent up demand. We had already gone through the periods of holding back on spend in TAS, starting from the middle of 2023 through the middle of 2024. And so at that point, drugs that have been approved needed to be launched, and that’s what’s happening now. So what we’re doing, TAS, is support the launch of new drugs, market access, pricing of drugs, supporting commercialization efforts, et cetera. And, that’s the day in and day out day-to-day business of our clients. And, they haven’t stopped doing that. So we haven’t seen that. I understand the question, but in the TAS business, we are seeing continued good growth as expected. And, again, I believe that the spend has been held back for a while and there is pent up demand and necessary things to do. Now, the discretionary stuff, the absolute discretionary stuff, consulting and so on, yeah, I mean, not spectacular. This is just like flat- to mid-single-digits kind of current level. So it’s not that we are looking at spectacular things. So, what is being done now is the stuff that was necessary to operate. I mentioned real-world before as well as the pent up demand on other things. And that’s what’s driving TAS. So I don’t see the environment influencing this much. On the R&DS side, yeah, again, because of uncertainty, so you hold back on decisions. The type of reprioritization we saw before were due to the IRA. And I think as we mentioned prior calls, we see that to be largely over. The reprioritization of pipelines, which led to elevated levels of cancellations that were triggered by certain provisions of the IRA, and I remind you, the IRA was, I guess, at late 2022, and this process started in 2023. So, we are now a couple of good 2 years after that process started. And we believe that that reprioritization process of R&D pipeline at large pharma due to the IRA is largely complete. Now, could there be other cancellations? We haven’t seen that yet due to new developments. We don’t know. Again, no one really knows the exact impact of what has been signaled by the new administration. The uncertainty has caused delays in decision making. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that the time from receiving the RFP to the actual award has expanded by about 10%, in some cases more than that, both year-over-year and sequentially. So, that’s an indication, if you will, a high level metric, but we know this directly from clients of all as well. We’re planning on making the decision this quarter, but we’re just going to wait a little bit to understand the implications. No one has signaled that they are not going to do the program, but it’s just natural that in an environment of uncertainty, you hold off on making the decision on large capital investments.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Ryskin at Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I’m just going to follow-up on, I think, Matt Sykes’ earlier question, talked about cancellations in the quarter already being kind of normal. Maybe I could hone in on book-to-bill trends. I know you don’t like talking about this number quarterly, but just 1.02 in the quarter. Last year, you called out a few major cancellations across 3Q to be lower. This year – this quarter doesn’t seem to be the case. Is really – so what do you attribute that number to? Is it really the emerging bios that you talked about? How some of the RFPs aren’t quite in bookings yet, because the funding is not there? Is that the major swing in the air? And so, do you expect to be closer to that 1.15, 1.2 number for the rest of the year?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. So I love this question on the quarterly book-to-bill. I mentioned before that awards that should have been contracted in the quarter, the contract wasn’t signed and was delayed. So that happened at large pharma a number of times in the quarter, and that’s due to this uncertainty, general uncertainty in the biopharmaceutical sector. That’s one reason for softer movements. The second reason, as you mentioned, is the EBP funding. I think you noticed that there are many different sources for what was the EBP funding in a given quarter, but we follow consistently by the world stats. And I think the funding in the first quarter went down to [$13 billion. Now, $13 million] [ph] is fine, but it’s way lower than what we had seen before. And that’s an indication, I think, whatever source you look at, you’ll see that EBP funding decline. Again, it’s due to the same reasons people are hesitant to commit the funds. If that happened, that the EBP signs a contract with us and we decide not to include it in the bookings, because we’re not sure about the funding. But that happens, like, once or twice in a given quarter. Here, we had much larger number of such cases in the quarter. So, again, the two reasons all deriving from the same underlying factor, which is the macro uncertainty. Large pharma picking down the signature of the contract through a later period and EBP not confirming that the funding is secure for a contract they’ve already signed. And as a result, we do not include that in our bookings. That’s what caused the softer bookings in this particular quarter, not the cancellations. Now, again, I mean, I want to, since you break it up and it’s my kind of – it’s like agitating the red flag in front of the board, I typically react to mentions of quarterly book-to-bills. Look, we are projecting for our company 5% growth or thereabouts 5.2% for this year. If you focus on the CRO business, our guide for the year was 4% to 6% for the year, but we see that we have softer bookings. Even if it’s at the lower end of that range, the 4% kind of range for R&DS, and that’s excluding the step down of COVID business, which is about $100 million year-over-year. And FX, it’s still somewhere around 4%. Now, you look at our sector, there aren’t that many benchmarks out there, but we do have a large competitor that’s publicly traded and published its numbers. And I looked at the numbers this morning, and it happens to be coincidentally to the exact same book-to-bill ratios, quarterly or trailing 12 months, and yet, they are projecting negative growth. On a comparable basis, I think that negative growth is 5%. So you’ve got the same exact book-to-bill ratio, the same exact. We’re projecting about mid-single-digit growth, positive growth for that segment. And they’re projecting mid-single-digit decline, it’s an 8- or 9-point swing in revenue growth. So, if there ever was a proof point that this quarterly book-to-bill ratio doesn’t mean anything with respect to predicting growth and performance. I think that’s a very strong one. It’s an interesting snapshot picture of what’s going on at one given point in time, given circumstances in the world. It’s like we’re taking a picture of a particular horse in the Kentucky Derby in the mud running and you took at the picture and it looks like it’s all its muscles extended and doing extremely well. But then when you see the full movie, you see that the horse lost the race. So, it really doesn’t mean very much. It’s a snapshot. It’s interesting. But it doesn’t tell you the whole story. Sorry for that, once again.
Michael Ryskin: No. Not at all. Very fair point, Ari. Thank you for that color. I appreciate the context. If I could squeeze in quick follow-up, just any commentary on pricing environment. Just wondering if there’s any change in the quarter given all the macro uncertainty. And, again, this is more specific to R&DS. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: No change. Look, I mean, pricing is not enough level, has not been a level for some time. So, we are – the pricing negotiations always are tough. But again, as Mike mentioned earlier, we secured the strategic partnerships with our large pharma clients last year. That was the time at which all the rates were negotiated and so on. And so, I think, we are comfortable operating in the current environment. No changes.
Michael Ryskin: Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move next to Jailendra Singh at Truist Securities.
Jailendra Singh: Yeah. Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. So just given all the recent macro development and uncertainty you flagged, and thanks for all the color you gave Ari. Are you guys seeing any change in the RFP or new bookings mix in terms of FSO versus FSP? And one another follow-up quickly, if I can ask. What’s the latest two mega trials that were delayed? Are they expected to resume in second half? Sorry for two-parter.
Ari Bousbib: Those three questions. It sounds fine. Thank you very much for the questions. Number one, I think you’re talking about the mix, full service versus FSP. And, look, we had signals over the course of the prior year that large pharma was sort of doing a little bit more FSP. And I think we saw this reflected in the RFP flow and in the awards and in the bookings, okay, where FSP as a percentage of total was increasing. Okay. We said that in our bookings in the year, it was reaching in 2024, close to 20%. Whereas in our revenue, of course, it’s lower than that since we’re burning revenue related to prior period bookings. In our revenue, FSPs represented in 2024 more about 15% to 16%. So, obviously, we’re trying to do 20%. However, again, I said before many times that these are pendulum swings. We’ve seen it before in this industry where large pharma reverts to FSP, decides to insource more of the activity, but then they swing back. And I might – you might find it interesting to know that in the quarter, we actually started seeing some signs of this reversal. Okay. Actually in the quarter, FSP bookings represented less than 10% of the total. And, we look at our qualified pipeline, it’s in the mid-single-digits, low-single-digits. And in the RFP flow, it’s about 5%. We actually have very, very strong and exciting pipeline and RFP flow in full service work for large pharma. And the reasons are the same as the reasons that have always led our clients to do more outsourcing, which are basically that they cannot possibly have all the expertise in-house. Sometimes they buy an asset in a different therapeutic indication, and they need resources that they don’t have in-house. And thirdly, after they’ve been doing the FSP work and taking more oversight in-house, they realized that it can become prohibitively costly to do so over a large number of funds. And invariably, they revert back for any of these reasons to full service. And we’re starting to see some signals of that. It’s not just a snapshot in this case. It was through the bookings, it’s through the RFP flow, and it’s through the qualified pipeline where we see FSP as a percentage of total decline. I think you have another question. Yeah, the two mega trials. Yes. So the two mega trials we said had been postponed and taken out of the end of last year and pushed back to the back of this year, we received confirmation from one of them, and that’s the good news, that it’s expected to get started towards the second half, towards the end of the year as planned. So that’s confirmed. The second one, though, for reasons that are inherent to the client itself, the same logistics reasons they were facing before was pushed out of the period and won’t start this year. And, again, all of that was contemplated in our guidance, and so nothing’s changed with respect to our numbers.
Jailendra Singh: Okay. Thanks, Ari.
Ari Bousbib: Mike, any more color to add?
Mike Fedock: Yeah. Just to add a little bit more color on that. So, we are reaffirming our range with that mega trial pushed out of the period, as Ari said, plus let’s see what happens with the bookings environment for the balance of the year. You can conceivably see sort of R&DS probably shading more towards the lower end of guidance range, but we’ll have to see our BD teams are out there actively working to secure any business, and that’s kind of the current year.
Jailendra Singh: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We’ll move to our next question from Eric Coldwell at Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks. I have two, if you don’t mind. You might have just partially answered the first one. So, I was going to ask about the impact on guidance from FX. And the question was, was there any other change to the guidance or directionality of the guidance excluding FX? What I’m getting to is during the prepared remarks or maybe the Q&A, Ron said that the year-over-year gross margin reduction in Q1 was primarily FX, but FX has now turned from a big headwind to a moderate tailwind. So I’m questioning how much EBITDA and EPS were protected by the FX shift, i.e., would you have needed to maybe reduce the range on EBITDA and EPS if it weren’t for FX?
Ron Bruehlman: No. I mean, EBITDA is, you can think of it as being largely independent from the FX ranges. The impact of FX on EBITDA is very muted. The impact on revenue, obviously, isn’t. You saw a big increase in our guidance for the year on revenue, and the combination of those two reduce our margin, our implied margin guidance. But, yeah…
Eric Coldwell: No notable impact on EPS then for year…
Ron Bruehlman: No…
Eric Coldwell: And then, if I can have one more quickly, and apologize toggling like everyone, I guess, toggling multiple calls today, so I might have missed this. I have received a couple of inbound questions from investors during the call about TAS M&A and the M&A impact overall from the firm. So, if you address this, I’m sorry, but I am getting some questions on it. I thought I’d throw it out there.
Ron Bruehlman: There’s about 200 basis points for the quarter, Eric, and about 150 basis points for the year. The majority, but not entirely in TAS.
Eric Coldwell: So if TAS – so the question, Ron, was if TAS was the majority, and I don’t know if that’s 60% or 90%, but if it was the majority, then mathematically, I believe you could have picked up as much as 5 points of growth in TAS.
Ron Bruehlman: No, no, no.
Ari Bousbib: It wasn’t that much.
Ron Bruehlman: The organic growth in TAS was sort of mid-single-digits.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.
Ron Bruehlman: Low mid-single-digits. Yeah.
Operator: We’ll move next to David Windley at Jefferies.
David Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on margin and ask if you could talk about margin performance by segment. And then, on the restructuring activities, the expense that you took in the quarter, the add back was a little bigger. I wondered if you could comment related to cost takeout, what some of the targets are? Is it still kind of rightsizing headcount or facility consolidation? Or is it something else? And how we should think about those cost takeouts again going back to the margin by segment? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Well, look, what we’re doing in terms of margins and is essentially to work on our cost structure, the same way we’ve been working on it forever, address the overhead structure as we continue to scale up our business, address labor arbitrage. We have offshore centers all over the world for different centers of excellence, for different types of activities, both on the commercial and the R&DS side. And we continue to shift work different places where it’s optimal. And, finally, we use technology automation and our AI agents to bring more efficiencies to our processes. Those activities result in the restructuring of headcount, literally all over the world and in both in all segments. So that’s what you see reflected in the whole and the structured numbers, but that’s the – do we talk about margins by segments? I mean, we do – we have disclosure of…
Ron Bruehlman: We have a disclosure, segment disclosure on a GAAP basis. Look, there’s a little bit more pressure on overall margin in the R&DS segment than there is in the TAS segment. Both had good SG&A performance, a little bit more gross margin pressure in the R&DS segment. Some of that mix related relating to FSP and also increases higher growth in the lab business that tends to be a little bit lower margin.
Ari Bousbib: This is the mix. The mix influences margins in the segments, right? So, real-world, for example, is somewhat lower margin than the rest of the business than the analytics or the data or the technology. And so, as a result, when real-world grows faster, you do have a mix impact on margins. That’s for the commercial side. And then, on the R&DS, as Ron mentioned, FSP and lab do have lower margin profile than full service. And as I mentioned, in our revenues, FSP is a little bit higher, maybe the point two in the quarter. In the revenue side, I mentioned earlier that in my commentary on bookings and pipeline and RFPs that it seems to be going the other way now. But on the revenue side, FSP was a little larger in the quarter and lab was a little bit larger. And those two have somewhat lower margin profiles than for service. So, yes, we did have the quarter adverse mix impact on margins. But, again, that can fluctuate quarter to quarter.
David Windley: All right. Yes. I was just saying any pass through movement as part of that conversation that we should be aware of pass through change in the revenue composition?
Ron Bruehlman: No, nothing over the long-term.
Ari Bousbib: No, not the area of significant. No.
David Windley: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: All right. We have time for one more operator.
Operator: And we’ll go to Tejas Savant at Morgan Stanley.
Tejas Savant: Hey, guys. Thank you for the time here. So, I’ll ask a quick two-parter. Ron, any comments on the stranded costs associated with the mega trial that you said is now pushed to 2026? And is there any risk that the second trial, which you just got confirmation on, could slip again in that sort of 4Q timeframe into 2026 as well? And then, Ari, one for you on real-world evidence. You called out some of the unique sort of policy driven opportunities for that business over the medium-term. Is there anything you’re doing either organically or perhaps from an M&A standpoint that could position you to fully capitalize on some of these opportunities that are coming up?
Ron Bruehlman: I’ll start, Tejas, with the stranded cost. A little bit of impact, but not a huge impact. Obviously, on the trial that got further delayed, we’re going to free up those resources and use them for other purposes. We’re not going to keep them there indefinitely, but for the one that’s going forward, there is a little bit of impact, not terribly significant. And, well, we can only react to what our customer tells us on the trial that was further delayed, and we’re assuming that it’ll go forward. The customer still wants to do it, and we’ll fit.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. And the one that’s starting as planned, we got recent confirmation that that’s the plan. So there’s no further news on that or notification of any changes as of today. So that’s for that. What was your question? Real-world. Yeah. Well, no, look, real-world, I think, we are – the industry will tell you that we are recognized as the leader in the area in this segment. And we intend to fully capitalize on the opportunities that may emerge from any new initiatives from the administration, as I mentioned in my remarks. So I think, again, we are very well positioned here to navigate this sort of turbulent times. I’m very, very confident based on our conversations with clients that the world is not coming to an end and the industry will find ways to adapt. In fact, there are many reasons to feel very optimistic. As I said before, and I repeat again, I feel better at this point in the quarter than I did at the same point last quarter when I look at the metrics, whether it’s on the commercial side or on the R&DS side, and based on our conversation with clients. So with that…
Kerri Joseph: Okay. Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to join us today [Technical Difficulty] our second quarter 2025 earnings call. The team will be available for rest of the day to take any follow-up questions that you might have. Thank you very much, and have a good day.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, you may now begin your conference.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you Kerri and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. It was great to see many of you in-person at our December Investor Day at Innovation Park headquarters. I hope this helps you appreciate the depth and breadth of our offerings as we showcased product demos and tour some of our industry leading laboratories. In fact, a number of you commented to me afterwards that they left with a deeper understanding of the breadth and depth of our capabilities and how our strategy to improve patient outcomes is being executed. As we closed 2024 we delivered solid full year results with revenue growth of 5.5% at constant currency excluding the COVID revenue step down, adjusted diluted earnings per share growing over 9% and free cash flow of $2.1 billion, which represents growth of 41% versus last year, as well as 104% of adjusted net income. I'm very proud of the results the IQVIA team was able to deliver in an industry that faced significant challenges in 2024. We saw the consequences of the Inflation Reduction Act, which led to delayed customer decision making, reduced discretionary spend and portfolio reprioritizations. Additionally, we had a challenging macro environment that persisted with geopolitical unrest, continued high interest rates and inflation, foreign currency headwinds and questions about the impact of political elections in the U.S. and around the world, all of which created tremendous amount of noise and incremental uncertainty. In fact, very few companies in our broader industry sector achieved positive growth and IQVIA really stood out as an outperformer. More specifically, in the fourth quarter you saw that we had strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range representing about 4.5% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. We delivered just under 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and we achieved a record quarter of free cash flow. On the clinical side, net new bookings for the quarter were over $2.5 billion and this all highlights the great work that was done by our R&DS team in securing new business contracts. This helped mitigate the outsized level of cancellations that did materialize in the quarter, just as we had anticipated. Now, despite the tough macro environment, the R&DS business had some significant achievements in 2024. We successfully renewed all of our large pharma strategic partnerships this past year, even as many clients reevaluated and consolidated their alliances. In addition, we established new relationships, displaced incumbents and expanded the scope of work in several partnerships, positively positioning our business for future growth. IQVIA has partnerships with 22 of the top 25 pharma companies. We made significant advancements in our global health business. For example, we helped the World Health Organization control polio virus outbreaks in Africa. We collaborated with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, in Rwanda, so we were able to respond swiftly to a Marburg virus disease outbreak. Finally, we were selected by a large biotech client to expedite a vaccine trial for Mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa, addressing a critical outbreak and unmet medical needs. These all comes to show that whenever there is a crisis, IQVIA is a company public health officials turn to. Now moving to TAS. The growth trajectory materialized just the way we said it would. Low single digit growth in the first half and gradually ramping up each quarter. In fact, growth exceeded our expectations in the second half. Obviously, this was helped by easier compares versus the second half of 2023. But we also had stronger organic demand than expected across all sub-segments with real world actually returning to double digit growth. We finished the year with constant currency growth of 5.7% and about 6.5% excluding the COVID step down, which was at the high end of our guidance. We expect to sustain these favorable trends into 2025. Reflecting on 2024, we're proud of what we achieved in TAS. A couple of business highlights. We introduced 60 innovations this past year, including 39 AI-enabled applications. For example, we introduced IQVIA AI Assistant, our first ever gen AI interface. It allows customers to interact with a growing number of our products and get answers to their questions almost instantly. We launched a number of AI-enabled patient offerings, including our Patient Relationship Manager, which has already been deployed at eight clients including three top 10 pharma. Our digital business, which up to now was largely in the U.S., has begun expanding into Europe where we've doubled the number of websites, publishers and partners that are now integrated into our digital network. Now looking at 2025, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided to you at the December Investor Day. On the TAS side, things have continued to recover as we anticipated. On the R&DS side, we still have some volatility, so we might see another quarter or two of fluctuating demand and elevated cancellations, but we think the bulk of the portfolio reprioritizations at large pharma has been completed. In fact, we feel good about the R&DS demand environment because leading indicators continue to be favorable. For example, our Q4 RFP flow was up mid single digits, little higher actually in the EBP segment. Our qualified pipeline is also up with positive growth across all segments. EBP funding, as you noted, was strong through 2024. Full year biotech funding was over $100 billion, which is 44% higher than it had been in 2023. Now we did have much higher cancellations in 2024 than ever before, in fact nearly 50% higher in 2024 than the average of the previous three years. But our gross new bookings before cancellations for 2024 were even stronger and up mid single digits at constant currency versus 2023, which led to an end of year backlog of $31.1 billion, which is again at constant currency 5.5% higher than a year ago. Now turning to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3% at constant currency. Compared to last year and excluding COVID related work from both periods, we grew the top line about 4.5% on a constant currency basis and that included in the quarter about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, mostly on the TAS side. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 3.1% driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline which resulted in 20 bps of margin expansion. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $3.12 increased 9.9% year-over-year. Let me now give you some color on business activity. IQVIA success is achieved by continuing to raise the bar in innovation every year and investing in highly differentiated capabilities. You saw the recent announcement of our collaboration with NVIDIA to transform healthcare and life sciences through advanced agentic AI solutions. AI has the potential to transform our industry, for example by addressing lengthy and complex processes in clinical trials or on the commercial side by helping expedite diagnosis and improve treatment adherence by patients. Our collaboration with NVIDIA will help accelerate the introduction of AI agents within our workflows, with AI agents essentially becoming digital companions to researchers, HCPs and patients. Let me give you some more examples of what was achieved in the quarter and let me start with TAS. The business is rapidly evolving as we see increasing demand for integrated solutions that combine information, analytics and services. This is enabling us to win much larger longer term deals with our clients because of our unique ability to deliver these combined offerings. Let me give you a few examples. IQVIA was awarded a strategic partnership to deliver omnichannel marketing solutions to promote a top ten pharma clients established portfolio. IQVIA here we utilize analytics, information technology and commercial outsourcing capabilities. IQVIA is also partnering with a biotech company to launch a new treatment for ovarian cancer which will be our client's first product in market. This large deal leverages IQV’s comprehensive commercial capabilities and expertise to execute regulatory process, launch and commercial activities. Another EBP client asked IQVIA to support them in launching a new cell therapy for a severe pediatric condition by providing the full, comprehensive, commercial infrastructure and that includes field sales, medical and commercial communications, compliance and OCE. A large pharma client engaged IQVIA to simplify data management by integrating diverse sources from all over – 30 countries, reducing complexity and enhancing efficiency. IQVIA will support the client’s information strategy to streamline operations and centralize its global information into a single, standardized system that we will be operating. Moving now to real-world, IQVIA is using advanced AI to support a top ten pharma client to demonstrate efficacy for gastric cancer treatment and gain approval in new markets. A top 10, 15 pharma clients chose IQVIA to help track disease and treatment efficacy in support of various regulatory submissions in Europe. Let me move now to RDS. I earlier noted the success of our RDS team and want to highlight some notable wins that represent our capabilities across segments, therapeutic areas and operational dynamics. Let me start with large pharma. The top five pharma clients selected IQVIA to conduct a complex, full service Phase 3 study addressing asthma and COPD patients. We won another full service global Phase 3 breast cancer study for a top 30 pharma. Another top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA a large FSP contract. This award is notable, because we displaced two large, long-time, incumbent CROs. MedTech, IQVIA was awarded a study to evaluate a novel medical device specifically targeting a cardiovascular condition. Biotech, few notable awards include a critical Phase 3 oncology study based on our strong data-driven approach and ability to manage global complex trials efficiently. Another global study full service study for another biotech client for progressive pulmonary fibrosis disease which involves nearly 1,000 patients in 26 countries. And again, we are able to win this based on our global footprint and therapeutic expertise, a Phase 2 trial for rare CNS conditions with limited previous research. Lots of success in the marketplace with large pharma, MedTech and EBP. Now, before passing the call over to Ron for a more detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for their extraordinary work this past year. It was challenging, but we delivered, a great team. We also received amazing recognitions throughout the year. I just want to highlight a few. Frost & Sullivan awarded IQVIA at the 2024 Global Customer Value Leadership Award for excellence in AI quality and regulatory solutions in healthcare. IQVIA’s SmartSolve Enterprise QMS was recognized for Best Use of AI in Healthcare by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards. My Green Lab awarded IQVIA Laboratories the 2024 Race to Zero Leadership Award for certifying 100% of our laboratory. We received recognition as a leader in Forbes World's Best Healthcare and Life Sciences Management. And lastly, for the eighth year in a row, IQVIA was named one of the World's Most Admired Companies in Fortune's annual survey and importantly for the fourth year in a row, IQVIA was named the number one most admired company in our category of healthcare, pharmacy and other services. In addition, IQVIA earned number one ranking in the categories of Innovation, Global Competitiveness, People Management and use of Corporate Assets. Now Ron will give you more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari. And good morning everyone. Let's start with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,958 million grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3% constant currency. In the quarter COVID-related revenues were approximately $10 million, which is down about $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID related work both from this year and from last, constant currency growth was about 4.5%. And as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately two points of this growth. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,658 million which was up 8.3% reported and 9.5% constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2,123 million was down 1.3% reported and 1% constant currency. But excluding all COVID-related work, R&DS revenue grew over 1% at constant currency. And finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions’ fourth quarter revenue of $177 million declined 4.8% reported and 3.2% of constant currency. Now for the full year, revenue was $15,405 million, that's up 2.8% reported and 3.4% at constant currencies. COVID-related revenue totaled approximately $110 million for the year. Excluding all COVID-related work from this year and last, constant currency growth and revenue was 5.5% for the year. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue $6,160 million, that was up 5.1% reported, 5.7% at constant currency and 6.5% excluding all COVID-related work at constant currency. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $8,527 million, up 1.6% on a reported basis, 2% of constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work growth in constant currency in R&DS was over 5%. And finally our full year CSMS revenue was $718 million, down 1.2% reported but up 1.4% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned in his opening remarks, the 2024 growth trajectory in TAS played out as we anticipated with improvements every quarter. We had we experienced a softening growth rate throughout 2023 due to cautious customer discretionary spending and we predicted that 2024 would be a turnaround year based on our forward-looking indicators in recent history. In fact, that's what happened in 2024 TAS growth picked up significantly, finishing the second half with high single digit growth driven by strong mid-single digit organic growth. As you know, TAS is a short cycle part of our business and as we've seen, 2023 gave us early insight into customer spend behavior during the downturn. By the same token, we expect that the 2024 turnaround in TAS serves as a good leading indicator of the industry's recovery for 2025. Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $996 million, representing growth of 3.1% full year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3,684,000,000, that's up 3.2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $437 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42. For the full year GAAP net income was $1,373,000,000 or $7.49 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $564 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.12. That for the full year brought adjusted net income to $2,042,000,000 in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $11.13. R&DS backlog at December 31 was $31.1 billion, an increase of 4.4% year-over-year and 5.5% at constant currency. And to anticipate the question that, I think, we'll get about why backlog was flat sequentially versus Q3, recall that the dollar strengthened considerably during the fourth quarter and we have to retranslate the backlog at the end of each quarter for reporting to you and that knocked about a $0.5 billion off the backlog that retranslation alone. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,702,000,000 and gross debt was $13,983,000,000, resulting in net debt of $12,281,000,000. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.33 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $885 million. And CapEx was $164 million resulting in free cash flow of $721 million for the quarter, a record quarterly free cash flow. For the full year free cash flow was $2,114,000,000, as Ari said, up 41% year-over-year. Now you note that in the quarter we repurchased $1,150,000,000 of our shares bringing our full year share to $1,350,000,000. And just yesterday actually the IQVIA Board of Directors replenished the share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, which increases the total remaining authorization to approximately $3 billion. Now let's turn to the guidance. For the full year, we're reaffirming our 2025 outlook, which is for revenue growth at constant currency ex-COVID of 4% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of up to 20 basis points, and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% to 9%. This translates into total revenue between $15,725 million and $16,125 million, which includes just over a $100 million step down in COVID-related work, which is entirely in R&DS and of which 75% will be in the first half and 25% the second half. We expect 100 basis points to 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and an FX headwind should rates continue of approximately 150 basis points versus 2024. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3,765 million to $3,885 million in adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $11.70 to $12.10. This includes about $675 million of net interest expense, approximately $575 million of operational D&A, an effective income tax rate of about 18.5%, and an average diluted share count of approximately 178 million shares. The guidance also assumes $2 billion of cash deployment split between acquisitions and share repurchase. And finally, the guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 5 continue for the balance of the year. Now at the segment level, guidance is also unchanged for TAS, R&DS and CSMS. No changes in any of the segments. We expect TAS revenue to grow 5% to 7% at constant currency, which translates into $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. A note, we'll have easier comps in the first half than the second half. R&DS revenue is expected to grow 4% to 6% at constant currency ex-COVID, which translates into $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion of revenue. This guidance includes over $100 million of step down in COVID-related revenue that represents about 100 basis points of headwind R&DS growth rate. We anticipate that R&DS growth rates will be lower in the first half and improve sequentially thereafter. A final CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million flattish year-over-year. Now let's look at first quarter guidance. For the first quarter we expect revenue to be between $3,740 million and $3,790 million. Note that Q1 has the largest impact in the year for both foreign exchange and COVID revenue step down for a total of approximately 300 basis points of headwind. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $870 million and $890 million in the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.60 and $2.70. And as mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates of February 5 continue for the balance of the year. So, let's summarize. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter, which closed out a strong year. For the full year, revenue grew 5.5% of constant currency excluding COVID-related work. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to expand and adjusted diluted EPS was up 9.1%. Free cash flow was a record in the quarter at $721 million, bringing the full year to over $2.1 billion, up 41%. In the quarter, we repurchased $1,150 million of her shares for the full year. Share repurchase was $1,350 million. Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, which brings the remaining authorization to approximately $3 billion. During the year, we introduced 60 innovations including 39 AI-enabled applications, and the momentum continues to build with our recently announced collaboration with NVIDIA. IQVIA was named a Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies for the eighth consecutive year and earned first place ranking in our industry group for the fourth consecutive year. And lastly, we reaffirmed our full year 2025 revenue growth guidance at constant currency of 4% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of up to 20 basis points and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% to 9%. And that concludes our formal remarks. Let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the call Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Ari, I wanted to just ask you to dig back in a little bit more on how the operating environment progressed through the quarter and relative to what you were expecting in 4Q? We had some discussion about reassessing of vendor relationships kind of ending or the expectation it would end in the fourth quarter and some of that reprioritizing work ending. We're still talking about some potential volatility for the next one to two quarters. Is that kind of the way you were expecting it coming into the fourth quarter? Or is there any change into about that? And as part of that, maybe you could talk about is there any change in your expectation in those divided contracts that you discussed last quarter? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, thank you, Shlomo. Well, no, look, we spoke not that long ago in December in a rally, and we shared there our sentiment with respect to the operating environment. Not much has changed versus what we told you then. That is, it was a difficult operating environment for all the reasons we mentioned then, and I reiterated in my introductory remarks the macro environment consequences of the IRA, a bunch of unexpected large cancellations due to futility reasons we had last year. And then the two large fast burning trials that we had just started that for reasons in the panel of IQVIA were just delayed and because of the nature of these projects they basically pushed back to the back end of 2025. Nothing's changed here. We think the bulk of the cancellations and reprioritizations has occurred. We said then, I repeat now, we're still going to have [indiscernible] of some volatility. And I sitting here, I can't tell you what it's going to be, first quarter or second quarter in December, we were closer to the end of the quarter, so I had more visibility, frankly after one month in a quarter, you can never tell. What are we going to book? What are we going to sell? Which deals are going to come in this quarter, are going to be pushed up to the next quarter, which cancellations may or may not occur this quarter? We have no idea. I'm just always shocked when people are able to predict what their bookings, the net bookings will be in a given quarter. I have no idea. As I stand here one month into the quarter, especially first month of the year, January, not much happens. So yes, I mean, I would say, what is it two-thirds maybe 70%, 75% of the somewhere there, almost two-thirds, 75% of the reprioritization that we know of at large pharma essentially is our own. So there may still be a little bit of fluctuation here in the next quarter or two, but I can't tell for certain what may or may not happen. And with respect to these two trials that were delayed, which was your second question, nothing changed. They're still on. The clients very much want to do them. It causes us to have to maintain some costs, through the year, and that's kind of affecting a little bit our gross margin because we have this shredded cost. But that's okay. We will manage that and we feel good about that. And those will happen. As we said, no change back end of the year.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, Ari. Hi, Ron. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on two things. I think you've been given some nice pharma color. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the biotech environment, how that's going, how you're sort of seeing RFP flow? Are you seeing any kind of unlocking of some of the funds that were raised last year but not spent? And then also talk a little bit more about what you think the drivers on the real world evidence acceleration are? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, all right. So look, the biotech funding, which is a sort of a leading indicator of what is going to happen in terms of the booking environment for that segment, has been strong. Okay. We consistently use the same, stats, and according to those facts, it's over $100 billion for 2024. There's been fluctuation, quarter-in, quarter-out. But that's the number, and that's a huge number. That's a record number ever, if you exclude the two years of 2020 and 2021, which were, I think $130 billion and $120 billion [ph], respectively. But I mean, last year, what was the number last year, guys, for? It was like in the $70 million – $71 million [ph] last year. Okay, so significant growth in funding. Now, as we said before, just because biotech gets funding today doesn't mean that it translates into a clinical trial award the next day. Okay? It takes time and take six months, take a year. But it's a good, strong leading indicator. And we saw funding start to pick up already a year ago. And therefore, we're still, we're starting to see this RFP flow, as I said, was up mid single digit for us across the portfolio, which again, in the current environment is very, very good. And EVP was higher than that. Okay. Higher than the 5%. And yes, so that's about the environment. So I think we feel good about the EBP segment, lots of opportunity and we're chasing all of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. Just on cancellations, I know going into Q4, you thought it would be a $1 billion. Did it come into that $1 billion or was it higher? And then I know you said that you successfully renewed all your RFP activity. Can you just talk about pricing on those renewals and how that's playing out from a competitive landscape? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Right. Well, first of all, I never said the word a billion. I said that historically the average quarterly cancellations is about $0.5 billion of quarter-in, quarter-out. I mean, identify anyone to predict what the cancellations would be in a given quarter ever. That's it's a flow, and there were calls where we had $300 million where there were calls where we had $600 million. But on average, that's kind of the number, okay? And if you take a look at the past and so what I said was given the amount of work that large pharma is doing and the scrutiny that they are placing on those programs and the increased level of cancer as we saw through the years, I was suggesting that it wouldn't be surprising the fourth quarter was double that. And basically it was that it wasn't a billion, but it was way above the higher end of what we could have imagined. So it was somewhere around that. Not far from a billion, but not quite a billion. So it was very high. In fact, for the year and I think that's an interesting, I mean, actually I mentioned it in my introductory remarks. If you look at the average cancellations in a given year, let's take the last three years, for example, it's just somewhere close to a couple of billion [ph], a little bit under $2 billion, right, for the year, okay, consistent with what you experienced. This year, it was almost 50% higher, meaning this year, 2024 was 50% higher than that. And despite that, we grew – our backlog grew and that's because we were able on the growth level to book even more business than last year, offsetting – more than offsetting the higher level of cancellation. So on the demand side, things are good. The cancellations were very elevated. I look at the surprises there, it came essentially as we expected. And, as I said, I just don't know where they're going to be next quarter or two, but we are going to navigate that environment. We feel good that the bulk of that is behind us. You asked about the pricing environment of things, right?
Ann Hynes: Yes.
Ari Bousbib: So I mean, yes, I mean, look in the current environment you would expect and anticipate that pricing is going to be more difficult because, it's tough competition. There are lots of CROs out there. I mean, people tend to forget, there are 4,000 CROs out there, okay. So they don't all participate in every single bid, but it's not unusual that when, EVPs go around and shop their dealer around, they talk to a lot of people. And on the large pharma side as we mentioned, they decided last year to reopen all their partnerships. And thankfully, we won. We re-signed with all these partners and in fact expanded our portfolio. Large pharma wanted to consolidate the spend and we were on the winning side of that exercise, that was very good and it bodes well for the future.
Ann Hynes: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and a good segue from the last. Ari, you've talked a fair amount about the push toward FSP. You've talked about, pricing pressures you just kind of highlighted generally. But that pricing pressure also in FSP with these partnership, re-procurements. And then you've also talked about carrying costs for these mega trials. I was actually surprised at the Investor Day that you could expand margin at all. And so, my question is, what are the cost levers that you're pulling to be able to eke-up your margin just a little bit in the face of all those pressures? And then just more simply in the navigation on gross margin versus SG&A and EBITDA, are we seeing some of that business mix shift toward FSP and P&L already like in the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Dave. Well, as always you're right on the mark and you are highlighting essentially the tasks that we have day-in and day-out. How do we offset all of those headwinds? Yes, you are absolutely correct. You expressed surprise how we're able to still grow margins. I mean, bear in mind, since the [indiscernible], we've grown our margins. I mean, we had a quarter with over 25%.
Ron Bruehlman: Correct.
Ari Bousbib: ...adjusted EBITDA margins. In those days you might recall we were more in the 20% kind of range. So we expanded margins. Now in the early years we sell margins a lot more. Now obviously it's harder, but that is what we do here. We try our best to grow our margins, and try to grow our profits faster than our revenue, that's our operating mode here. How do we do that? Yes, you're right. The mix influences can influence the gross margin. I don't think that that was the case in Q4. I think we see, you could see on gross margin was a little interesting in Q4, but I don't think it is a reflection of the higher FSP mix. The higher FSP mix is in the bookings. It's going to take time, okay? It's not yet in the P&L to be precise and answer your question. It's more quarter-in quarter-out, if you look at Q3, for example, of last year, we had gross margin expansion. So it's really the given mix of revenue that you recognize in a quarter, plus obviously the TAS business also influences that. For example, within TAS, I can tell you that real world is a little lower margin than the rest, right? It's lower margin than data, lower margin and analytics and lower margin than tech. And in the fourth quarter, real world was very strong, really strong. I mentioned it was back to double-digits, and so that, of course, affects the mix. And then I'll remind you that from the fourth quarter, we had these high level of stranded costs on those two mega trials that also affected gross margin. But we pulled the usual levers. And you've been covering us for a while, you know what we do. We constantly evaluate how to optimize the average labor rate across all of our geographies. We constantly explore opportunities to increase our economies of scope that is restructure, flatten the organization. We constantly lever IT infrastructure, and for the past year we've accelerated the deployment of AI tools within our own processes. I mentioned before that the next big thing, certainly operationally within our own workflows is to leverage AI tools as much as can be. And we start to see some impact of that, and we plan to continue use and deployment of those. And that these are the levers that help us mitigate all the cost pressures that you just highlighted. So it's a day-in, day-out deep in the trenches, strong operational discipline, and a relentless focus on continuing to optimize our costs.
David Windley: Good for you for that. Thank you very much. It was very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Ari, just wanted to go back maybe then to the TAS segment; I think earlier you just mentioned, and obviously real world evidence had something like you said double-digit growth in the quarter. Maybe can you give us a sense for sort of the trends you're seeing across between both RWE [ph], analytics and consulting and maybe technology platforms? And give us a sense for within the 2025 outlook, how you see those kind of separate parts of it, kind of the outlook for each of those relative as we think about the mix going forward?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, thank you for the question. Yes. I mean, look, the TAS business should be – should have been and should remain a very resilient business with very consistent type of growth. So info, as you know, is a low single-digit, right? It's about a 1% grower that did not change through the period. That's a very sticky subscription based repetitive business. The analytics and consulting is where we had seen a dramatic impact of the cautionary spending trends we saw end of 2023 and early 2024 because some of that – the significant part of that is discretionary spend and that essentially got shut down. So we had negative orders in analytics and consulting earlier in the year. And as we evolved through year, it went back towards these mid-single-digit kind of mark towards the end of the core year. And then the higher growth businesses, which had been higher growth, real world and tech, basically for the full year essentially went back to high single digits and in the quarter back into double-digits. So that's what we saw. Now because we anticipated this, why did this happen and why were we confident in the recovery is because a lot of the work in real world tech and also some in analytics and consulting are must do activities for our clients when our clients get the drug approved. And as you know, in 2023 was a record year. I think we had 55 approvals in 2023, by the way, 2024 was also good. I think it was about 50 approvals. These are very high numbers. If you look back historically, these approvals typically within six to nine months, you got to launch the project. And that's where we come in. This is where our services play. It's in launching the drug, promoting the drug, commercializing the drug, pricing the drug, et cetera, et cetera. supporting the efficacy demonstrations and safety demonstrations and supporting pricing for the drugs. All of that is also included in our analytics business and in our real-world business. And so those needed to be done and clients delayed that, but eventually they had to do it. And that's what we saw a strong return of the business in the second.
Charles Rhyee: Great, thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, and good morning. And a couple of questions for Ron. Just on the income statement. First was the gross margins in the fourth quarter? Was wondering if you could just walk us through the dynamics there. So, they were down a little over 100 bps year-over-year, but you had lower pass throughs. So, was this the trapped cost related to those two trials or just any other color would be great?
Ron Bruehlman: Well, the first thing I would caution is, when you're looking at gross margins, you're looking at reported and not adjusted. So, if you're trying to tie the gross margins and SG&A on our income statement back to our adjusted EBITDA, there's a difference right there because those are reported, not adjusted numbers. But having said that, Ari did already give you some insight into that. We have stranded costs associated with those trials that got delayed. Certain of our businesses that had strong growth like the real-world business tend to be lower margin businesses for us. So there's a mix impact in there certainly. But again, anytime you're looking at the reported numbers, remember that things like restructuring or other adjustments that get added back can affect the percentages that you're calculating straight off the income statement.
Jack Meehan: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And one for Ari just on the policy front, we're in a couple weeks, into the new administration here. Just any thoughts on, how just implications, for pharma, biotech customers. And then second, one question we get is just any exposure to NIH funding or anything related to that would be great. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: I mean the short answer to that question is zero. Zero impact, zero NIH, nothing. The longer answer is, I think overall it's going to be a more business friendly environment. That's clear. The new administration apparently from what we've gathered is maybe open to adjust some of the aspects of the IRA looking into differences between small and large molecules and a number of adjustments and we are in dialogue at the appropriate levels. There could be, some reforms have been discussed on the PDM side, on reimbursement side and so on. But I mean again all of that is net positive for us frankly. And yes, I mean we don't. I think there's a strong possibility the new administration will embrace life sciences innovation sector more positively relative to other competing economies like China or other or Europe and support more ongoing investments of U.S. based research, manufacturing, et cetera. I think there are a lot of positives here and I don't see, any of the noise around the specific nominations affecting us at all. Frankly, I think that's just basically noise, what we see and our dialogue so far has been actually very constructive and very positive. We're very pleased with the nominations at Head of the FDA and Head of NHS. All of those are very, very good, good relationships and they all support strong evidence-based science, which is exactly the business we're in. The M&A environment will be more favorable. I think all of that are net positives.
Jack Meehan: That all sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking a question. Ari, I want to go back to something you touched on earlier. You made some comments in the prepared remarks in terms of pharma reprioritization, sort of working through it. Still expect maybe a couple quarters of some volatility going forward, but thinking you're mostly through it. I think you said something about 70% to 75% of the rate prioritization is done. Just wondering sort of how you're arriving at that number. Just put a blindly. I mean we've had some announcements just in the last 24 hours and we just seems like there's still, you never know, companies could come back and decide they're going to do more and a second cut in the third cut and the fourth cut. So just what are the conversations you're having with the pharma companies? Especially, your top 20…
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question. When I said earlier, two thirds, 70%, maybe 75%. So I saw Kerry put his head in his hands because he told me for don't give them a number because someone is going to tell you 71%, maybe he's 65%, maybe it's 76%. So look, we're trying to give you a sense. Okay, how do I know? Because we speak to our clients, okay, Day in and day out and we know what they're looking at. So if they're done, they're done. It's not like they're going to go back. Okay. So we know that there are still a few large programs that are kind of where they haven't made a decision. And that's where I say, maybe a quarter to a third of those, more to go. But that's an estimate. Again, I repeat, I have no idea what gets, what is even called. All will get booked. I just don't know. Okay, I'm basing myself on conversations that we have with clients at every level. We know what their pipe is, we know what the programs that they have are, we know what they're prioritizing and they tell us what they are looking at. In fact, in many cases we help them review these programs and reanalyze them. So that's how we know. But it's all best based on these analysis. And that's my best guess for now. I mean, I would caution you always not to focus on a given quarter. Okay, I mean, I see, someone reports that. You've heard me before. I'm going on another tangent here. But, why about this obsessive focus on what's the, what are the bookings in a quarter, what's the book-to-bill that infamous number, what is it? And then you derive implications for an entire industry from what one company reports. You just can't do that. It's a long cycle business. One quarter is a window. There's been some volatility, there might be some overlap this year, I just don't know. Also, frankly, you have very little visibility on the sector. I said before, there are 4,000 CROs out there. You have no idea what their numbers are. Actually, our next best largest competitor is part of a larger company and they report nothing about this competitor of ours. Nothing. No revenues, no margins, no bookings, no backlog. Certainly no book-to-bill. So we have no idea. You have no idea. We have no idea. There are only four publicly traded CROs. Each and every one of them is extremely different from the others. You cannot derive what we report from what we report what's going to happen to them. We cannot derive what they report what's going to happen to us. I saw that before, earlier, in a few past quarters. Just because one of our competitors say something, all of a sudden our stock goes up or down. It's ridiculous. It’s everyone is extremely different. You just cannot extrapolate plus frankly it's causing issues with our customers. Someone was asking before about customers and pricing. That obsessive quarterly focus on this book-to-bill ratio causes. Our clients know that at Lazz Pharma they know that. So at the end of the quarter they handle another $10 million here, another $12 million there. That affects pricing, it affects our bottom-line long term and it's detrimental to investors. So there is a somewhat obsessive focus on these quarterly members in a long cycle business that are not upgrade. Plus again, I remind you, we are a large company. We're not just a Seattle. The CRO business is just over half of our business. And to infer, any thesis about what's going on in the industry from a quarter or two of cancellations or book-to-bills or what have you is intellectually flawed. I sort of, if I can share with, I can have my people here, agitated. But okay, I'll end with that. I'm sorry for.
Michael Ryskin: That's helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. All right. Should we have another question or. We're done here. We're done. Okay, fine. Kerry?
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, guys. Thanks for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter of 2025 earnings call. The team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Peroni, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range, representing about 6.5% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. And we also delivered 14% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we expected, the environment for our short-cycle businesses continues to improve as our clients are launching new drugs and executing on critical commercial programs. In fact, as revenue growth accelerated in Q3 to over 8% year-over-year, with growth in all subsegments. This reaffirms the second half growth trajectory that we had anticipated for TAS since the beginning of the year. And we now expect TAS growth for the year at the high end of our mid-single-digit range. On the clinical side, the near-term market environment continues to be choppy as we've been discussing in prior earnings calls. None of this is new, but as you know, we've been facing aggressive competitive pricing and tougher negotiations. Additionally, the trend that started over 1.5 years ago with large pharma re-prioritizing their program portfolios as a result of the IRA has been continuing, and this has been leading to a higher-than-normal level of cancellations, and we expect this to be the case again in the fourth quarter. On the EBP side, funding levels this year have improved. But as you know, it does take time for this funding to translate into actual RFP flows and even more time to translate into awards. Our bookings in the quarter included a substantial cancellation due to drug futility that impacted our quarterly net new business by approximately $350 million for that 1 trial. The reported net book-to-bill was 1.06x, but excluding the specific cancellation, the book-to-bill would be 1.22x. Lastly, in late September, 2 clients notified us of their need to delay 2 mega studies that were already in start-up phase due to client-related logistics issues. This affects our short-term guidance, and Ron will share more about that later. While we navigate through these short-term challenges, it's important to remember that our CRO business is a long-cycle business. The demand metrics give us confidence in the strength and resilience of our business. I'd like to share some details of what we are seeing. Firstly, as you may know, many large pharma companies have been running processes this year to reevaluate and consolidate their strategic partnerships. To date, we have successfully renewed every single large pharma strategic partnership. In fact, we've added new relationships, displaced incumbents and expanded the scope in over half a dozen of our strategic partnerships with large pharma clients. There are 2 aspects to this successful performance by the RBS team. One is that our existing large pharma customers have reaffirmed their trust in IQVIA. And two, it opens up opportunities for us to gain greater share of wallet in future programs because these clients have consolidated their strategic partnerships. In the EBP world, biotech funding reached about $16 billion in the quarter according to BioWorld, and that means that year-to-date, biotech funding was over $80 billion, which represents more than 50% growth in funding year-over-year. Now again, as I remarked earlier, it does take time, and it could take 1 year to 1.5 years before that funding translates in actual awards. Three, our backlog reached a new record of $31.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and that represents growth of 8% compared to the prior year. Four, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remains healthy at 1.22x. Fifth observation, our next 12 months revenue from backlog is up 5.5% year-over-year. Our quarterly RFP flow continued the same trend we saw in the first half, increasing mid-single digits year-over-year. And finally, our qualified pipeline in the quarter is up across all customer segments, and it grew low double-digits overall compared to the prior year. And that is good. Now just to be balanced, I should point out that in stronger market environments, that qualified pipeline has sometimes been up in high double-digits. Now let's turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 4.3% on a reported basis and 4.2% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line about 6.5% at constant currency of which just under 5% is organic growth. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5.7% and driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline, and that resulted in 30 bps of margin expansion. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2 and $0.84 increased 14.1% year-over-year. I'd like to share a few highlights as is our practice of business activity. Let me start with RMBS, where we continue to differentiate with our therapeutic expertise, clinical technology and public health offerings. IQVIA won a top 10 pharma partnership as a new preferred provider for Central Lab as well as secured extension for several existing FSP engagements in clinical monitoring, data management and clinical technology. We were awarded a strategic partnership to provide VCT solutions for metabolic and cardiovascular program at top 15 pharma clients. We're the only company that can offer the VCT services and technology without having to partner with third parties. Within oncology, which is, as you know, a key therapeutic area for our industry, we were selected by several leading sponsors in the quarter, including a U.S. biotech client to manage a large global Phase III study for renal cell carcinoma for patients who have progressed after first-line immunotherapy combinations. A large pharma customer to conduct an early phase trial in prostate cancer, leveraging our expertise in dose escalation and both expansion study designs, a biotech client to run a global Phase III study for a biosimilar targeting multiple myeloma. This project aims to bring the first biosimilar for multiple myeloma to market, a biotech client leader in cell and gene therapies to conduct a groundbreaking Phase III trial for reoccurring cancer in the lymphatic system. Across these awards, we differentiate with our ability to run global studies with dedicated teams as well as our AI-enabled site selection solutions. Within clinical technology, in fact, we continue to expand our recently launched one home for sites offering. A biotech client selected IQVIA to increase clinical trial capacity by streamlining access to multiple vendor sites via our single sign-on platform. In the quarter, a large biotech client selected IQVIA to expedite the setup of a trial to deliver vaccines for Mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa addressing a critical outbreak in the region and significant unmet medical needs. Finally, IQVIA in partnership with the coalition for epidemic preparedness and innovations [SETI], the Rwandan government and the several institutes responded to an outbreak of the Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic fever with greater than 50% futility in Rwanda at the end of September. Our organizations collaborated to mobilize and dose the first patient with an investigational vaccination within 9 days of the outbreak. Moving to TAS. As you saw from our results, the business is recovering even better than we had forecasted. One area we continue to make great strides in is in building differentiating AI capabilities across our offerings. You will have seen we recently launched the IQVIA AI assistant, which is a new generative AI tool designed to provide life science customers with quick and powerful insights through a user-friendly conversational interface.

Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.896 billion grew 4.3% on a reported basis and 4.2% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $20 million, down from about $100 million in the third quarter of 2023. Now excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was about 6.5%, of which just under 5% was organic. The majority of the acquisition contribution was in the TAS segment as is typical. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.554 billion, up 8.6% reported and 8.2% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.162 billion was up 1.9% recorded and an even 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was about 6%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $180 million declined 1.6% reported and 1.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $11.447 billion, up 3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency was 6% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.502 billion year-to-date, up 3.9% reported and 4.3% constant currency, excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS was 5% Now as a reminder, our Q1 2023 was last quarter were TAS revenue had a meaningful contribution from COVID-related work. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6.404 billion with up 2.6% at actual FX rate and 3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 7%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million was flat on a reported basis and up 3% at constant currencies. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million for the third quarter, which was growth of 5.7%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.688 billion, up 3.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $285 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $936 million, which represented $5.08 of diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84, up 13.2% and 14.1%, respectively, versus prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.478 billion or $8.02 per share. Our backlog at September 30th was $31.1 billion. That's up 8% year-over-year and 6.7% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from backlog was $7.8 billion, going 5.5% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet now. As of September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.572 billion and gross debt was $13.512 billion and that resulted in a net debt of $11.940 billion. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.27x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $721 million, and capital expenditures were $150 million, resulting in a very strong free cash flow of $571 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $200 million of our shares. That leaves us with just under $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Okay. Let's turn to guidance now. Now while our views on industry fundamentals remain positive, we are updating our full year guidance due to the delay in the 2 separate fast-burning mega trials, which clients communicated to us at the end of the quarter. These delays resulted from client-related logistical issues. Our team is working closely with these customers to ensure timely resumption of the trials in 2025. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15.350 billion and $15.400 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.675 billion and $3.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $11.10 and $11.20. There is no material change from our prior guidance to our assumptions around COVID related step-down in foreign exchange. The revenue growth contribution from acquisitions is expected to be about 1.5 points for the year. Now the second -- excuse me, at the segment level, we currently expect TAS to grow approximately 6% for the full year and R&D approximately 5%. Both growth rates are at constant currency, excluding the impact of the COVID revenue step down. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.903 billion and $3.953 billion. This includes TAS revenue of growth of approximately 8% in R&DS revenue growth of about 1%, both at constant currency and in the case of R&DS, excluding COVID-related impact. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $987 million and $1.12 billion. And adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is expected to be between $3.08 to $3.18. And this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30th continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, we delivered another quarter of strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance at about 6.5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 24.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 14% and as interest expense is no longer a headwind. Free cash flow was again strong, going 31% year-over-year, representing 109% cash conversion of adjusted net income. R&DS bookings were affected by the cancellation of one large program due to drug futility. We updated our Q4 guidance to reflect the delayed start of 2 fast-burning mega trials that are now expected to resume again in 2025. And while we are experiencing some near-term bumpiness in R&DS forward-looking indicators continue to signal a healthy demand environment, confirming the strength and resilience of this business into 2025 and beyond. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ann with Mizuho.
Ann Hynes: Any thoughts on preliminary 2025? I know the industry is going through a tough time now. But do you think you could still grow in that kind of high single-digit range given the backdrop?
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you, Ann. We don't usually give guidance for the following year at the time of the third quarter earnings release, but we do plan to at least give some indication of the '25, we look like at our investor meeting on this December 10th. And as always, to give you more precise guidance for the year, concurrent with the full year earnings release. Now having said that, look, I'm going to depart from what everybody else in the room is telling to do, and I'm going to tell you that what -- and I'll do that because the environment is so shaky and obviously, you're wondering what's going to happen in '25. So look, if you look at '24, we grew -- we will have grown the company about mid-single digits, okay? After all the short-term challenges that we signaled are absorbed. And my expectation is that it will be similar in '25. That's really a high-level expectation. We haven't finished our planning process, as you can imagine. But if you look at the segments TAS, as predicted, rebounded in the second half, and that is a short-cycle business. So I think things are coming back as expected, and we anticipate this will continue. So if TAS grows this year at constant currency, again, around 6% or so, then I think I'm expecting that the same will be true at least in '25. And then for RDS, which will continue to deal with these short-term cancellations in Q4 and probably the early part of '25, we are projecting a 5-ish percent growth, 5% plus growth for RDS for this year. I'm going to assume at this early stage, a little bit similar. That's what's guiding my observation that I think company-wide would be around those levels as well in '25. Again, that's just as a placeholder, I invite you to join us on December 10th, where our planning will be more advanced, and we'll share more about that. And certainly, our full year detailed guidance when we reach full year earnings.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo with Stifle.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Ari, I know it's one question, but I just want to get a lot more detail, if you can, on the trial delays because I can't talked about 2 trial issues also, they were talking about financial re-prioritization and stuff like that with some of their clients. You're talking about some kind of logistical issues. Can you give us a little bit more detail? Are these logistics physical logistics? What else could be involved in that? Does it have anything to do with the financials and what kind of confidence do you have that the projects will really ramp into the second half of '25? And if you kind of flush that out as much as possible would appreciate it.
Ari Bousbib : Yes. So look, I mean, what other competitors are experiencing is absolutely coincidental that 2 trials are out, and we have 2 trials. I understand why you're asking the question. Just again to step back and look at what's happening. We've got a general environment where, as I stated in my introductory remarks, large pharma has been reprioritizing their programs is nothing new here, and that has led that a direct consequence of the IRA. That has led to an elevated a number of cancellations. That affects the industry. That's the market environment. And frankly, even in that environment, we normally should be expected given our scale and performance and momentum, we should be expected to continue to deliver. And that's what we did for the first 3 quarters of the year. Separately and unfortunately, at the same time, we have had to deal with a very large cancellation that has nothing to do with reprioritization has to do with futility. And that obviously is affecting our short-term impact. Now in a normal environment, we would have been able to absorb that and move on. But because it's such a tough environment, and we're dealing with a general heightened level of cancellations, we've not been able to absorb that. Again, separately and unfortunately, concurrently, to clients, this is totally independent of anyone else of any reprioritization of any financial considerations of anything else, have had for their own reasons, we know what the reasons are. I cannot share them with you. We are subject to very strict NDAs for reasons. It has absolutely nothing to do with the drug, with us, with financials, we just can't tell you what the reasons are. I regret that. But those trials will resume, they happen to be fast burning, and they have tend to be very large. We are confident that they will resume in '25. Now I know it's a lot to absorb. And when you look at the whole picture, that's a lot of different things. I regret it as much as you, but that's the reality we're facing with. The choppy environment will navigate that on a normal circumstances, but we've had to deal with 2 discrete events unrelated really to the environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne with JPMorgan.
Anne Samuel: I was hoping perhaps you could help us understand just maybe the timing of some of these dynamics of the cancellations, how much notice do you get in advance? And when we think about the delays for kind of pushing to the back half of next year, did they impact any other projects for 2025, or does that become incremental to 2025?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. On cancellations, typically, Look, it depends, okay? All these -- there's 2 types of cancellations. And I'm going to roughly say that in this past year, what we are seeing is that about half is due to the reprioritization and about half is the normal drug futility based on results. How does it happen with the reprioritization, it's a process that our clients are going through? And they've been going through this for 1.5 years, and I believe we are peaking at this point. It has an end. This process has an end. I see this ending at the end of this year. That's my prediction. It's 1 month's prediction. But I think that we're going to still see elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter. We don't -- we -- now IQVIA does not give quarterly numbers for cancelation [Indiscernible], I've said before, normally, it's about $0.5 billion, and it can vary plus or minus $200 million either side. It's by definition, it's not a constant number. It cannot be the same number every quarter, okay? So there are quarters where it's 300. The -- as quarter whether it's 250, they are post 600, 700, the average is around 500. And I think that we are seeing -- I wouldn't be -- I'm not surprised to so see quarters where we have doubled that number because of these reprioritizations, okay? So that's what we're dealing with. The traditional cancellations other than reprioritization, the traditional cancellations that are due to data it usually takes time because you've got a piece of data that's not favorable. As you know, there are independent panels investigated panels that review that data, the discussions with the FDA. It's a long process. And even in order to reach the decision to cancel, it takes time. When that happens, it also takes time to unwind the trial. If the trial is ongoing as opposed to the trials that are canceled because of reprioritization, which are things that are simply taken out of backlog, programs are canceled because they are in the middle in flight because of results, it takes time to unwind. It could take 2 or 3 quarters because we have to deal with patients that are -- that have been dosed, that are on the treatment, et cetera. So there are serious reasons. And often, it leads to additional bookings of extra work in order to facilitate that disengagement. So that's -- again, it's a complex unwinding process. But I hope that helps answer your question. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman: A, you would also, I think, asked about delays and whether the delays at incremental work in 2025, don't forget, these are multiyear trials. So if '24 work gets pushed into '25, sure, we pick it up there, but '25 work gets pushed into '26. So I wouldn't think of these as being incremental to 2025.
Ari Bousbib: Right. That's correct. However, the sequential growth will be affected, right? So just because of the compares and --
Ron Bruehlman : Exactly. And we'll give you more information on the sequential growth that we expect as we go forward during our normal guidance process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Barclays.
Luke Sergott: A couple of cleanups here to start. On the M&A, you guys did $228 million, I think, in the quarter. Any update there on like the financial profile and is all this in TAS and kind of how we think about that business growing so we can -- from more perspective in the next year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you. Well, yes, you're correct. As has been typically the case, the majority of our acquisition contribution is in TAS. But I would point out that in the quarter, TAS had a very strong step-up in organic growth. In fact, more than 3x sequentially. The company-wide organic growth was just under 5%, excluding acquisitions. So acquisition contributed to just over 1.5 points to our about 6.5 points of growth at constant currency, excluding COVID. Now if you do the math, you'll see that the organic growth in TAS was also mid-single-digits, which, again, is over 3x what it was in the prior quarter. So strong in TAS across the board organically. Since you asked about acquisitions, I just want to step back and reiterate what I've said many times before, and that is that acquisitions are an important part of our growth algorithm, always has been the case, and hopefully, will continue to be the case. In fact, we always aimed at least 2 points of incremental growth from acquisitions. But if you look at our numbers, you'll see that historically, we've never been able to do 2 points plus of growth. It's been more between 1 and 1.5 points. And this year, hopefully, 1.5% of contribution from acquisitions. Now bear in mind, we do a very large number of tiny, tiny deals, okay? You have the list here in front of you, Ron?
Ron Bruehlman : Just to give an example -- a couple of examples this year in the -- in a TAS area, we did an acquisition of a commercial engagement company, H3O, that has $1 million of annual revenue, we did a real-world platform B2i, that had slightly over $1 million of revenue. So when you look at the total number of acquisitions we do, it looks like a really big number, but there are any number of very small acquisition.
Ari Bousbib: That's typical. If you look at our list of actual acquisitions with all these little fancy names and they are important, okay, these are little deals that we -- we do this because we believe we are pretty good at buying good companies with potential growth. And typically, after we integrate them within a year or 2 of ownership, they do very well. So again, the vast majority of this deal has very little revenue. Now sometimes, we have to pay up a lot. I mean there are -- there's a handful of acquisitions we've done in the past -- in the recent past that we've paid 10x revenue for. I've seeing over the DMD, for example, like a couple of years, which facilitate our entry into the digital space. We paid almost 10x revenue for that company. So if you will, the acquisition number, the dollar paid for the acquisitions and the revenue contributions are not connected. For example, year-to-date, what's the [indiscernible] acquisitions year-to-date as of Q3 --
Ron Bruehlman : $649 million.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. We spent $649 million year-to-date on acquisitions at the -- as of the end of the third quarter. Almost half of that was 1 acquisition, a company called Micra, which is a small specialized CRO in med devices. It's actually an RDS acquisition, and we bought that in the third quarter, sometime in August, if I remember, and that was almost half of the spend. And we paid almost 5x revenue for that. So obviously, it's a big number in terms of the spend, but the revenue contribution this year of that acquisition is de minimis, okay? Because again, we paid almost 5x. We bought that in -- it has maybe one month of revenue in the quarter, and that's what it was. So again, very important acquisition as part of our strategy. Thanks for asking the question. By the way, I would remind you the best deal we ever did was the acquisition of the 40% minority we didn't yet own from our joint venture with Quest in our central lab. That was the largest deal that we did. And we paid $760 million for that. It came with exactly zero revenue because we already consolidated revenue, right? But it was a great deal nonetheless. So again, I hope that helps give context to our acquisition strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin with Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: Looking forward to seeing the lab at the innovation center in December. Ari, just sticking with the M&A. I think at the -- in capital deployment at the beginning of the year, you guys talked about $2 billion deployment. I think when you put together the M&A and the buyback, you're still tracking below $1 billion. So assume nothing gets done in the fourth quarter, would it be fair to assume like sort of like $3 billion of dry powder for 2025? And then just related to the comments around pricing pressure. I think earlier, you've said it's been mostly concentrated to FSP. Are you seeing that spill over all into FSO?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well, thank you, Justin. This a great question. On the capital deployment, as you know, we signaled between $2 billion and $3 billion as a long-term goal annually spread between acquisitions and share repurchase. And as you correctly pointed out, so far this year, we saw the numbers so far, we spent $649 million on acquisitions and just $200 million on share repurchase. And frankly, that's because we were looking at bigger acquisitions that we were unable to do either for pricing or other reasons. Acquisitions, as you know, are binary, you do them, or you don't do them. Now based on what I know today, I don't think that we're going to spend a lot more on acquisitions before the end of the year. Maybe, again, I'm speculating between another $50 million to $100 million at the most. And therefore, you correct to point out, that leaves us with a lot of dry powder. My intention before the earnings release was to massively buy shares in the fourth quarter. And today, my intention is even to more massively buy share at the end of the quarter. My general counsel specifically said, on his head here, but I am telling you that we are very excited, and we are going to buy a lot of shares. We have $2.2 billion plus share buyback authorization. And the share price is screaming buy, and that's where we're going to spend our capital. Then you had a question on pricing. Pricing is tough across the board, has been commercial and RDS, obviously, it's not that it's more on FSP than on FSO, it's just that FSP was stronger this year. FSP is perhaps, correct me if I'm wrong, over here, it's about 15% of revenue roughly.
Ron Bruehlman : Yes, correct.
Ari Bousbib: And -- but it's been increasing in terms of our bookings and inching towards 20%, right? So eventually, it will be about 20%. But again, we might win again other FSOs. So I think it will be always between 15% and 20%. And FSP has, as you know, lower margins. So that depresses our -- it's a headwind to our margins because of mix. Every time we do more FSP, pricing is tough across the board, okay? One, because, as I mentioned before, this year, clients, most large pharma companies, put us through a sort of a rebid process, invited every CRO under the song, and as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we did very well there. Essentially in every single one of these bid processes we were reselected for our existing strategic partnerships, and we expanded with half a dozen strategic partners and expanded the scope of what we are going to be preferred suppliers for, including especially for Central Lab. So we think that the future is very bright on R&DS. And again, pricing, very tough. That's 1 reason. The other reason is that we have, as you know, the industry has kind of sort of split between 3 large CROs and then another set of second-tier who have had, let's say, more trouble in the recent past and who are desperate to win business. And when you're desperate, the place you go to is price. And so all of that, even though they never selected, they end up creating somewhat of a more pricing pressure. And clients, of course, are going to be delighted to use them for that purpose. So these are the reasons. It doesn't look like it's improving. It's going to continue to be tough. But again, we are confident that we will continue to win and do well in the long term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David with Jefferies.
David Windley: I wanted to start with just a clarification. I think based on the book-to-bill that you're reporting this morning, you added about $140 million of new wins bookings above revenue. Your backlog is growing about $500 million. Is the difference there just FX? So that's clarification. And then are you thinking about taking the timing issues, the cancellations, et cetera, the pricing pressure that you just commented on, how should we think about your ability to manage cost structure and continue to kind of hold margin or deliver margin as you have in the past in this environment?
Ari Bousbib: Dave, first of all, the first observation in your math, I think, is correct. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but based on what I heard, I think you're absolutely on the mark with the math on the bookings and the backlog. Your question on the cost management is an excellent one, and you probably are inferring from what we said correctly that we have to deal with significant cost headwinds for the following reasons. These delays, as you can imagine, we have already started up those 2 mega trials, okay? They were in start-up phase. And therefore, we stood up the resources and the infrastructure, the teams and everything that's required to perform and deliver on those trials. Now they are interrupted. So it's almost like -- but they are going to resume in '25. I think one of them in second quarter and then the rest basically second half and ramp up in the second half. Now we are not going to let these resources go and do what we just did to ramp up the resources. So that already is a cost that we have to bear. Now obviously, we're going to redeploy some of that against some of the other opportunities, FSP and so on. But nevertheless, there is no question that we are going to be living here over the next 2, 3 quarters, with an extra bucket of costs associated with this. And these are huge trials, okay? And that is going to affect our margins. Now again, we haven't finished our planning process. We have a lot of other levers. We are working constantly on costs. And we -- I mean, you saw, obviously, we hadn't yet been affected by this issue so far, but you saw that so far this year, we've done pretty well. And we've actually in the fourth quarter, achieved record margins, I think, 24.1% is the highest operating margins, that we have achieved since the company was created in '16, correct. So we've done well, 30 bps of expansion this quarter. But again, in the next 2, 3 quarters, we will have to see. And we'll share more details on December 10th and certainly on [Indiscernible] with the full year earnings release. But David, you're exactly on the mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Maybe 1 high-level question and 1 number's question. Can you tell me where we are in this sort of strategic partnership? Obviously, that's been an area of strength for you guys. But sort of, are we just through this brand? Are we sort of still beginning? Is that not the right way to think about it? And then on the number's side, can you -- what do you think the interest expense is going to be for 2024 in your updated guidance?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Elizabeth. Yes, I mean, the strategic partnerships we did very well this year. Listen, we've been working with these clients for a long time. As you know, we expanded the number of logos that we have preferred partnerships with. And so this year -- and I think it's part of the overall reaction to the IRA and the overall focus on cost management, you know that most large pharma companies announced massive cost reduction programs, and so they opened up, they reopened all of their vendor relationships. I believe that we are largely through all of that. And I think that we are ready to move forward. Most of the large ones essentially have been completed. So that's for your first question. And second question --
Ron Bruehlman : Interest expense, talking about this year, Elizabeth round number, $625 million or so, give or take, around that number, which is not terribly different than what we were telling you before.
Elizabeth Anderson: Got it. And do you want to comment on '25 right now or not on that.
Ron Bruehlman : '25 interest, I mean obviously, it depends to an extent on what the Fed and the ECB do with interest rates, but flattish for next year -- we're anticipating, but we'll update as we go along.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael with Leerink Partners.
Michael Cherny: I know we don't have formal '25 guidance, so it might be trading a little lightly here. But relative to R&DS and the 5% rough give or take, expectation at this point in time. What are the conditions have to look like relative from a macro basis, cancellation rates, et cetera, to make sure that number is still feasible. Is that predicated on those 2 mega trials re-ramping with the second half? And what are the most important puts and takes you're focused on that could change versus what the current trend is of general market choppiness?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, I wish I had a crystal ball, but I can only tell you what we see now. I believe that by the end of the year, this program reprioritizations will come to an end. We know that because we are in close conversations with our clients. And look, that's the business our clients are in, is to do research and innovate. They have been at this for 1.5 years, started, I think, in the -- just in the kind of middle of last year. I think this is -- we basically know what's been reprioritized and canceled. We know what will be canceled by the end of the year basically. Now there could be other trials that have drug futility issues that can always happen, but that's kind of in a normal range of things, and we anticipate that. In that mid-single-digit type of high-level expectations that we have as of now for '25 for R&DS, that's based on what we know today that has been canceled, the large -- you know that we had this $350 million program canceled in the quarter that we took in. We also had, in the first quarter, launched a $250 million program cancellation. And we know that these 2 programs mega trends have been delayed. And then we factored in everything else. Again, most of the trials are much smaller than that, and we work on hundreds and over 2,000 of them. So it's going to be the normal course of things. These big ones move the needle. If you look at R&DS growth this year, we had 7% in the first quarter. What did we have? First quarter was ex-COVID constant currency --
Ron Bruehlman : 8%.
Ari Bousbib: Right, 8% first quarter. Then we had 6% and 6% in -- on, again, a constant currency ex-COVID basis. And then we're going to have 1% in the fourth quarter. So similar to what I said last year about TAS, it might be like a mirror image in '25, okay, with things going the other way. Just because of the cancellations, the short-term impact of that and the delay is the short-term impact of that. So that's our best I can describe what we expect for '25 at this point based on what we know.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Joseph. I turn the call back over to you.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 5% revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID related work, and 8.6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. The fundamentals of the industry remain healthy, which supports our confidence in the outlook for our business. On the commercial side, things are starting to gradually improve, and while customers continue to exercise budgetary cautiousness, we see faster decisions and more focus on carrying out mission critical projects such as those associated with launching new drugs. As you recall, new FDA approvals for 2023 were 55, which was the second largest year since 2017. And in fact, year-to-date approvals are at 21, which is in line with the average for the last five years. In the quarter, TAS came in a little better than our expectations, consistent with the improving leading indicators that we cited earlier this year. Both Consulting and Analytics and real world revenue improved sequentially in the second quarter. We said TAS revenue growth for 2024 was going to be the mirror image of 2023. And in fact, TAS revenue growth was about 3% in the first quarter and it was 4% in the second quarter, excluding COVID and foreign exchange. At constant currency and based on looking -- on forward-looking indicators, we remain confident in our full year forecast for TAS. This implies 6% to 7% growth for the balance of the year, resulting in full year mid-single digit growth, again consistent with the target we established for TAS at the beginning of the year. On the clinical side, while we continue to see the trend we have observed over the past year with large pharma reprioritizing their portfolios of programs and reallocating money to the most attractive ones in response largely to the IRA, demand from our large pharma clients in R&DS remains solid. We are also encouraged by the continued acceleration of EBP funding. In fact, BioWorld reports emerging biotech funding for the second quarter was $22.9 billion, which is up 32% versus the prior year. For the first half, biotech funding is about $70 billion, essentially equal to the entire year of 2023. Obviously, it does take time for funding to translate into RFP flows, but certainly, it bodes well for mid-long term prospects in our EBP segment. In the quarter, R&DS recorded good net new bookings of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 127. Backlog reached a new record of $30.6 billion, which is growth of 7.7% versus prior year. And in fact, that's actually 8.1% when you remove the impact of foreign exchange. And of course, all of our usual forward-looking indicators RFP flows, overall pipeline, and qualified pipeline are up. Turning now to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 5% at constant currency, including approximately 1.5% from acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.64 increased 8.66% year-over-year. Now I'd like to spend a bit of time on highlighting some of our business activities. Starting with us, IQVIA contracted with the Top 20 client to expand the implementation of our commercial technology ecosystem. IQVIA's AI/ML offerings, including analytics and OCE integrate seamlessly into the clients' technology infrastructure and allow our client to manage their data more effectively and to optimize their customer engagement. In the quarter, IQVIA won a multi-year contract with the top five clients to increase the effectiveness of the digital communication strategy. Here, our innovative solution enables targeted audience selection and custom content delivery. In our first quarter call, we shared a preview of a large deal awarded in April for our current OCE offering. This is a multi-year global implementation for a major division of a top five pharma client with 1,000 users, and it's displacing the incumbent. As you know, IQVIA has a rich history of developing AI for healthcare. For the last 10 years, we've invested heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that support our clients from clinical development through commercialization. Our AI offerings are specifically engineered to meet the demanding standards of precision, speed, privacy, and trust that are required in healthcare, whether it's in-patient support services or analytics or pharmacovigilance, our proprietary AI software solutions have become market leading. Let me share a few examples of AI wins and awards in TAS this last call. We launched a GenAI solution, which collects structured and unstructured survey inputs from over 30,000 HCPs across 36 countries in multiple languages and in minutes delivers analytics and insights to our clients on how their interactions and messages about their brand resonated. This work would normally take a week at least for human analysts using existing tools. A Top 10 client awarded IQVIA a contract to implement our centralized GenAI reporting and analytics solution across their entire U.S. sales force, consolidating different legacy tools. IQVIA's comprehensive GenAI solution enables users to ask questions and get contextual responses in the form of charts, graphs, and KPIs. This AI solution also proactively alerts the user of key trends, anomalies, and the changes that would be required. In another example, a U.S. Medtech client selected IQVIA to implement IQVIA's AI solution to onboard and train patients to utilize their medical device for diabetes. IQVIA's AI solution incorporates the real time sentiment analysis, provides automated transcription and smart engagement recommendations. It empowers patients to take more control of their treatment, which, of course, promotes better adherence to treatment protocols. Lastly, for AI in TAS, IQVIA won the award of Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare out of 4,500 nominations in the 8th Annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards. IQVIA's leading AI solution here is called SmartSolve Enterprise Quality Management System, eQMS, which simplifies quality compliance and connects regulatory and quality processes for life sciences customers. Moving to real world. IQVIA won an effectiveness study with a mid-sized pharma client focusing on patients who have not responded well to their previous migraine treatments. We were selected due to our strong therapeutic expertise combined with our direct-to-patient approach to accelerate recruitment and reduce site burden. A U.S. EBP client awarded IQVIA a real-world post approval safety and efficacy study in Japan for their coronary intravascular therapy. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their device, which could potentially increase the clients' market share in Japan, as well as help the client register the device in other regions. Within the quarter, a Top 15 pharma client awarded IQVIA a significant contract to study the effectiveness of a therapy for schizophrenia. The study will use data tokenization to link multiple data sources and then apply AI to provide a comprehensive view of patients pre and post-therapy in real world settings to physicians, patients and caretakers. Finally, you may have seen that IQVIA was recognized by a respected independent third-party research organization as a leader in medical affairs and life sciences regulatory operations. IQVIA's global end-to-end solutions enable medical affairs customers to manage and curate the richness of data coming into the organization, transforming evidence into insights that can enable actionable initiatives. Let me now move to R&DS. Let's start with the trending therapeutic area, obesity treatment. A Top 15 pharma client selected IQVIA Labs to conduct globally harmonized high volume testing to ensure accelerated enrollment. It's expected this will result in a significant reduction of study timelines for this therapeutic area, where speed-to-market is key. Our strength in the vaccine development area led to another major role to conduct a Phase III trial for a new influenza vaccine that will enroll approximately 50,000 volunteers. Turning to oncology, which represents, once again our largest therapeutic area in R&DS bookings this quarter. I'll offer a few examples. A Top 20 client selected IQVIA to conduct a large Phase III oncology study focusing on small cell lung cancer, a disease with a high need for effective treatments. We won this study due to our strong therapeutic expertise, data and analytics capabilities as well as our proven delivery approach, which includes a dedicated delivery unit project staffing that is exclusively focused on the clients' study. By the way, for some time now, we've been deploying this unique delivery approach for large customers, who have an especially complex study portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas. A biotech client selected IQVIA to support a large scale global complex Phase III program to test and validate their innovative cell and gene therapy vaccine for colorectal cancer. Lastly, in oncology, a Top 25 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to develop an optimum clinical strategy and to execute a bladder cancer study in the U.S. They were awarded this engagement-based on IQVIA's AI enabled site selection and feasibility solutions that will help the clients meet aggressive timelines. We discussed AI initiatives in TAS and, in fact, AI enablement is also pervasive in RDS. A couple of other such examples; a U.S. biotech client awarded IQVIA for full service clinical trials, which are supported by IQVIA's AI enabled data and analytics, increasing the likelihood of success for each trial reducing the risk of protocol amendments as well as the need to add countries and sites after the trial starts. In another example, we were awarded a Pharmacovigilance Project by a large biotech client to manage all case processing work worldwide using our AI capabilities. The IQVIA AI enabled solution is designed to dramatically improve productivity, reduce cost, and enhance data quality and accuracy. We will continue to share more exciting AI initiatives across the businesses, hopefully, at future investor forums. I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Hey. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3,814 million, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID related revenues were approximately $45 million, which is down about $70 million versus the second quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was 5%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,495 million, which was up 2.7% reported and 3.8% at constant currency. And if we exclude COVID work from both years, it was exactly 4% growth. As you may recall, Q1 2023 was the last quarter with meaningful COVID activity in TAS. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,147 million was up 2.4% reported and 3.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 6%. And lastly, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $172 million, declined 2.3% reported, but grew 2.8% at constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were $7,551 million, up 2.3% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, growth at constant currency was 5.5%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2,948 million, up 1.7% reported and 2.4% in constant currency, and excluding all COVID related work growth at constant currency in TAS in the first half was 3.5%. R&D Solutions' first half revenue of $4,242 million was up 2.9% at actual FX rates and 3.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 7% for the half. And lastly, CSMS first half revenue of $361 million increased 0.8% reported and 5% at constant currency. Let's move down to P&L now. Our adjusted EBITDA was $887 million for the second quarter, representing growth of 2.7%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1,749 million, up 2% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $363 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $651 million or $3.53 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $487 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.64. For the first half, adjusted net income was $955 million or $5.18 per share. Now, as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions bookings were again strong in the quarter. Our backlog at June 30 was $30.6 billion, up 7.7% at actual currency and 8.1% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.8 billion, growing 6.9% year-over-year. So let's turn now to the balance sheet. As of June 30th, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $1,545 million and gross debt was $13,258 million, that results in net debt of $11,713 million. Our net leverage ratio ending the quarter was 3.25 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $588 million and capital expenditures were $143 million, and that resulted in free cash flow of $445 million. Okay. Turning to guidance. With the first half of the year now behind us and better forward visibility, we're refining our financial guidance for the balance of the year. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15,425 million and $15,525 million. Adjusted EBITDA should be between $3,705 million and $3,765 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.30. There is no material change to our previous assumptions about COVID related step down, acquisition impacts and foreign exchange impacts. By segment, at constant currency ex-COVID, our full year guidance remains the same and is unchanged versus what we gave you back in February, which is to say TAS will grow this year around 5% and R&DS in the 7% range. Moving now to third quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be between $3,830 million and $3,880 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $925 million and $950 million and adjusted diluted EPS should be between $2.76 and $2.86. Now all our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, we delivered another solid quarter of financial performance. R&DS had bookings of $2.7 billion with a strong book-to-bill of 1.27. TAS performed well against our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.6% year-over-year. We're now leaving behind the interest expense headwinds and are moving back towards resuming double-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow for the quarter and for the first half were strong, driven by strong collections performance, and we remain confident that both TAS and R&DS will achieve the full-year targets for revenue growth we provided at the beginning of the year. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the session for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. It looks like a very solid quarter and we're seeing the TAS improving, which is definitely heartening. A question I have, Ari and Ron, is just -- the guidance is raised for revenue and EPS at the midpoint, but if you look at the EBITDA guidance, it was lowered a little bit. Maybe you could talk about what's going on and the nature of the revenue that's coming through for the year. And maybe just a little bit also in terms of the kind of pacing, we got the third quarter, so we could imply the fourth quarter, and if you could talk a little bit about the ramp you expect in the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. Look, I wouldn't read much into the tweaks in the guidance. It's -- we review all of our business unit forecast and we build all that up and it falls wherever it falls. The FX is slightly more favorable than it was last time we reported. So that kind of is driving a little bit in aggregate, the higher -- a little bit higher on revenue. Again, I wouldn't read much there. EBITDA, it's -- whatever the mix of business fell, okay? When you have a little bit more of certain offerings than others. And as a result, we've got the margin fell whatever it fell. But look, we're still delivering margin growth and even -- I mean, yeah, I see what you mean. I mean, frankly, I didn't even -- we don't focus on that. These are small tweaks, and I wouldn't -- it could vary again next quarter. So there is nothing other than wherever the mix of business fell, frankly. We're still delivering at this level, what's the margin expansion here, about 30 basis points at the midpoint and 50 at the high end. So that's very strong given the markets we've been navigating here from the -- for the first half. And on the EPS, I think it's largely better control of CapEx, which, in turn, more favorability on D&A. And so, it's below the line basically. That drives the EPS -- the higher point on EPS. Again, these are tweaks. I wouldn't pay much -- I wouldn't draw much conclusion on that.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Windley of Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Windley: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Ari, you've talked in some of your recent public commentary about price pressure or price expectations from customers in your opening remarks. You mentioned budget sensitivity, I think in the context of TAS. Could you just kind of bring us up to current on your assessment of the market environment in terms of customers' willingness to kind of pay your asking price?
Ari Bousbib: A good question. I did talk about this and -- in the past, and there is no change there. It is true. Again, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it's not like we've, all of a sudden, moved to a different bullish environment, clients, large pharma to focus on that segment first. It has announced, I mean, there is barely a large pharma company that has not announced a massive cost cutting program, multi-billion dollars, and often that comes first with a review of their procurement practices and their vendors and we are a top vendor to pharma. So there's no surprise here. What I said before is still valid. Those budgetary constraints persist, the cautiousness persists and, of course, we -- it's not like we can price whatever we want. Now clients still need to do some projects, many of them had been postponed and delayed. We see that improving. Our decision timeline had started to improve and now they have improved more dramatically. They're not where they were before this whole cautiousness begun. But they have improved significantly, which is why we feel more confident with the forecast. Pricing, yeah, I mean, look, large pharma clients are more disciplined in their spending and therefore, it's a tougher fight out there in terms of negotiations, no question about that. And it's true in TAS and it's true in R&DS, frankly. At the same time, you've got -- on the R&DS side, on the CRO side, you get really an industry that has kind of segmented itself in a way with three large players and a bunch of smaller ones, including some who are, sometimes desperate for business and becoming more undisciplined with respect to how they go about approaching their bids and so on and so forth and, obviously, clients, fully take -- you can expect clients fully taking advantage of that. So again, the answer to your question is pricing continues to be tough for all the reasons I just mentioned, both on the commercial and on the R&DS side. We, of course, respond with continued increase in our productivity programs, cost containment programs, as well as a lot of deployment of AI within our own operations. Those things take time, obviously, there is always a lag when we implement these solutions before we can get the full benefit. But that's what's happening on pricing. Thank you, David.
David Windley: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Anne Samuel: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit more about the performance of your different business segments within TAS and perhaps where you started to see some of that outperformance. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. You mean within TAS, the different segments. Look, I mean the data business continues the same and there's no news there and the rest of the business has become -- begun to improve. Sequentially, we've seen improvements everywhere. Year-over-year, in aggregate, it's up. Again, excluding COVID and FX, the rest of the business, as you know, data is low-single digits, flattish, and the rest of the business, in aggregate, has started to grow mid to high-single digits overall. Real world, I would say, in particular -- real world, in particular, has picked up significantly this past quarter.
Anne Samuel: That's great to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question this morning. Can you talk about the burn rate maybe in the back half of the year? Is that something you could sort of see based on the mix of business at this point that you think could creep up sequentially? How do you kind of view that as we progress through the back half?
Ari Bousbib: On the clinical side?
Elizabeth Anderson: Yeah.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I mean, look, this fluctuates, first of all, I mean the reported revenue and even after excluding COVID and FX is -- sometimes it's hard to predict exactly where pass-throughs are going to come in. And so, some of that quarterly fluctuation, if you will, is pass-through the weeks of pass-throughs. That's essentially what we see this -- what we saw this quarter and probably next quarter and then on rebounding for the fourth quarter. But basically of R&DS, we see a growth exactly where we forecasted it at the beginning of the year, which is in the -- after you adjust for COVID and at constant-currency in the 7% plus percent range. With respect to the mix of products -- of our offerings, as you know, we do have a disproportionate share of the oncology programs out there. Again, not surprising. The critical decision factors here are therapeutic expertise and the ability to enroll patients, which is where our unique capabilities with data analytics and AI solutions come in. And as a result, the mix of our bookings and in our backlog continues to increase towards those more complex studies in oncology as well as rare diseases. So the burn rate is largely influenced by that. You can see, by the way, that this is a trend in the industry. If you look at the burn rate for our competitors, and they are also going down. Now in the first quarter, the first-quarter backlog burn was 7%, is that what I recall was 7% and Q2 backlog burn was about the same, a little bit higher, 7.1%. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting it to be very similar. We are encouraged that the next 12 months' bookings are up. I think, we say, it's -- next 12 months' booking -- next 12 months' revenue from backlog is $7.8 billion. That's up from what we reported first quarter in my recollections is growing, was it $7.3 billion? Yeah. It's up $7.3 billion last -- and then this quarter $7.8 billion, that's about 6.9% up. So we feel confident in our back -- in our conversion and is consequently on our burn of projects and revenue growth in the balance of the year and next year.
Elizabeth Anderson: Great. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Smock of William Blair. Your line is open.
Max Smock: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. And apologies if I missed this, but within R&DS, did you quantify how much RFP flows in the qualified pipeline were up at the end of the second quarter? And then how are you thinking about the timeline for those to convert to potential uptick in bookings? Could we see an acceleration in book-to-bill above 1.3 times before the end of the year here or given kind of where we are in the year, are we now at a point where you think a more meaningful potential rebound in bookings is more of a 2025 event? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Max. I'm just -- we are laughing here because when did 1.3 become the benchmark? I mean, I know we reported amazing over 1.3 book-to-bill ratios in the past couple of years, largely because of the COVID studies and so on. But we're very happy with 1.27, we're happy with 1.2. We are happy with these book-to-bills. They are very, very strong. And you're talking about a rebound in bookings. We had excellent bookings. I don't know what -- we are happy with this performance. There's no rebound. It's very good. I think the bookings we reported this quarter are the first -- third highest ever, right. So I'm not sure what the question is with respect to bookings. Did you ask about conversion as well or no, I'm sorry, I didn't…
Max Smock: Yeah. I'm sorry -- you set such a high bar, Ari. But yeah, in terms of the first part of the question.
Ari Bousbib: That's true. We hand the price.
Max Smock: Yeah. Sorry, victim of expectations. But my first part of the question was just around whether or not you can provide any sort of detail or more detail around just how much RFP flows in the qualified pipeline?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. So again, RFP flows, total pipeline and qualified pipeline in this area are up basically all around. The qualified pipeline, I think, it was up across the number of 12%, was up 12%. And total pipeline is up single digits. RFP grows as well, right, but mid-teens, right?
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. RFP grows up single-digits.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah.
Max Smock: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh of Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. I want to go back to the individual businesses you talked about in TAS -- RWE and Consulting both improving in the second quarter. Last quarter you called out RWE, some recovery after some slowdown in Q4, Consulting taking a step down. How are you thinking about these individual businesses as you think about TAS expectations in second half considering that recovery in consulting remains relatively volatile? And is RWE back to mid to high-teens growth rate or is there still room for recovery there?
Ari Bousbib: No. I mean, we see overall TAS in the second half in the 6% to 7% range at constant currency, okay? That's what we see after -- obviously, businesses are rolling up their forecasts and they are always higher than that, but we take some contingency, we evaluate the environment and we discount that and that's where we are now in the 6% to 7% range, in aggregate. And you could make the assumptions yourself, you could see that in order to get to that. If 30% of the business is essentially flattish, that's the data. So the 70% has to grow in the high-single-digits in aggregate in order to get us to those numbers. So that's where we see the forecast. And we feel, I should add, very confident based on the leading indicators that we look at.
Jailendra Singh: But your real world numbers sound optimistic.
Ari Bousbib: Which one? Double-digits?
Jailendra Singh: Yeah, well, may not…
Ari Bousbib: No, not yet.
Jailendra Singh: No. That is -- not like that.
Ari Bousbib: No. Not high-teens. No. Maybe could be low-teens, but high-single to low-teens for the real world. Exactly. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers of DB. Your line is open.
Justin Bowers: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. So just in terms of the strength in TAS and the outlook for the rest of the year, how much of that is, in your sense the underlying market improving versus IQVIA winning its fair share of business with some of the tools that you have? And then, part two of that would be, what are some of the changes that you've made to manage the part of the business this year versus, let's say, last year at this time?
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you. First of all, it's not like the market is rebounding. I mentioned before that client cautiousness and budgetary discipline continues especially at large pharma. It's not -- didn't go away. But what we did say before was that within the portfolio of offerings that we have, there are certain things that are mission-critical for our clients. And what happened last time -- last year at this time is that we expected those things to happen and they were pushed to the right, okay? They were delayed. We said all along that at some point those things have to be done. And that is what is happening now, and what we see happening in the second half. So it's not like the market overall has grown is that the segments of the market that are -- must-do for our clients are finally happening, and they will be happening in the second half. So that's number one for the market. So from that sense, you could say that the market is a little better in the sense that the clients are willing to spend that money, but, again, I mentioned before, the negotiations are tougher. So to answer the second part of your question, what we are doing differently here is, obviously, being more responsive to our client needs. We are being more accommodating with their terms and we are commercially being more aggressive to make sure that we actually do win those projects that the markets are putting out there, the clients are putting out there for bid.
Justin Bowers: Understood. One quick follow-up. In terms of the improving decision-making timelines that you referenced earlier too. Is that for -- is that around some of the stuff that was pushed out to the right or is that for some new opportunities as well or just something you're seeing more broadly?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. It's true. It's true broadly. Obviously, the mission-critical stuff is mission-critical and needs to be done. So yeah, that is improving the overall average, but even -- I would say, even for the rest, I think we've seen improved decision-making. Faster timelines. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Tejas Savant: Hey guys. Good morning, and thanks for the time here. Ari, just following up on that line of questioning on TAS. I guess could you share a little bit of color around what gives you confidence to this improved decision-making timeline sort of dynamic continues here, particularly given the election cycle that sort of heating up as we speak? And then, on the analytics and consulting piece within TAS, are you starting to see the work related to those new drug approvals you talked about both year-to-date and last year starting to show up in the project backlog or is that still upside to come heading into year-end in '25? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, I don't think the election has much influence on the day-to-day decision-making with respect to launching of drugs. And in order to response to the second part of your question, the answer is yes. Those approvals, obviously, it's not common for a client to decide that they're not going to launch a drug that's been approved. So -- and there is usually a six months to -- six months to nine months’ time lag before that leads to -- between the approval and the time at which the drug is actually launched, and the work associated with it comes to us, so not much. This was delayed a little bit longer versus what it should have been and some of these projects that should have happened earlier this year are happening in the second half of the year. Again, no surprises here. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of UBS. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. So I have a question on the guidance. It seems that the inferred Q4 sales ramp compared to Q3 is a bit greater than typical. Can you talk about the drivers of that and perhaps even elaborate further on your conviction in the recovery in TAS in the back half? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. You want to answer that anyone here? I mean, look, first of all, there is recovery in TAS. We just talked about it at length in the past few questions. So that's understandable. Secondly, the compare is more favorable. We had a deterioration in the fourth quarter last year. It was the lowest quarter of the year, last year. And we said all along that there would be a mirror image in '24 versus '23, that is the first quarter will resemble the fourth quarter, the second quarter will resemble the third quarter, etc. So we do see fourth quarter up. But -- and it's not unusual by the way, there is a seasonality in Q4 that you can go back many years. It's always the case that Q4 is much stronger. So these are the three reasons; one, recovery in TAS accelerating; two, compares; and three, seasonality, which is not surprising. Anything else, guys, you want to…
Ron Bruehlman: I think I covered that, as simple as that. Yeah.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah.
Dan Leonard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks, Ari. I want to ask about M&A. I think so far you've spent maybe, was it $220 odd million of -- in terms of acquisitions so far in the first half. Can you talk about sort of what the revenue contribution has been because I think in the guide was about 150 basis points of revenue growth? And just curious, has that been in TAS or in RDS or both? And how much do you still need to maybe do for the back half of the year? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. So look, we said all along that it will be -- acquisition would contribute to a better point to our growth this year. And we wish we would do more acquisitions, but valuations continue to be high and we are -- we have a big pipeline, but it's not always the case that we are able to close. So far for the year, it's a little bit more than a point and it's a little bit more entire than in RDS, but that's it. And look, just -- we haven't spent much so far, but we hope to spend more in the second half and we'll see what happens. Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure you addressed this before, but there have been a couple of prominent cancellations of clinical trials in the industry in the last couple of months. You called out one specifically on 1Q that impacted your performance then -- in your book-to-bill then. Just wondering if cancellations have trended any better recently. I know that the prominent ones always make the news, but just wondering what's happening behind below the surface on that trend.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. No. I mean, look, I mentioned in my commentary and we've said this every quarter in the past few quarters, and it's just not a secret. The world knows that large pharma -- largely in response to the IRA and hypothetical impacts down the line. Large pharma has been reprioritizing their programs. And they've taken off-the-shelf some programs that they felt were either too competitive with other existing drugs or that didn't have the same risk-return profiles that they had assumed pre-IRA when those programs were launched. So as a result of that, there have been a little bit more cancellations than usual really for the past few quarters. I think, in general, look, we don't tell you what the cancellations are. We report the net bookings. Our average quarterly cancellations are in the $0.5 billion range that has been the case for a long time and that's kind of $500 million plus or minus, whatever, $100 million to $200 million. So some quarters it's less. It could be $300 million or $400 million, some quarters, it could be more $600 million to $700 million or more. Most of these cancellations are $10 million, $15 million, $20 million, $25 million programs. That last quarter, because it was well-publicized and because it was a huge one-time number, we chose to let you know about it. We had had questions. Everyone knew that we were the ones doing that program and pre-call, we had had questions. So we decided to let you know about it. Yes, that's what it was. It was -- I don't remember the exact number in the quarter $4 billion in one shot. But that could happen. We have no -- companies are now usually when they terminate a program. It's partly this reprioritization that I just discussed and sometimes it's simply because of the data. And in the case of the program that we disclosed last quarter, it wasn't a reprioritization, it was simply that the data wasn't supporting a continuation of the program, and essentially the program failed as it often happens in this industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Jack Wallace: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back and ask a follow-up to the EBITDA guidance questions from earlier. Ari, you called out that there was some mix-shift impacting margins in the back half of the year, and with the TAS guidance largely reiterated in strong second quarter, I was wondering if you could help us get a better understanding for the mix-shift, which sounds like its intra-segment? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I don't think I can give you much more color than that. It's just what the chips fail, okay? So [Technical Difficulty] and I know that this would have attracted two questions. We would have to look at it again at this range, it's just -- we just build up our forecast and that's where the most appropriate range fell. It could be also -- we did a little bit more acquisitions this quarter and generally, acquisitions come in at very low margin in the first year. So that could have impacted. It's not a big different number, frankly. So in the grand scheme of things. So I can't give you much more color than that.
Jack Wallace: Fair enough. And then on the positive side here, right, in those CE, you won a sizable chunk of a top-five client. Can you just give us a better understanding for the one or handful of reasons that led that client to switch from the long-time incumbent? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: I think they liked our solution better. I think it gave them more ability to achieve their goals. I can't go into the details of the program, and that's -- yeah, they just like it better. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Ari, you talked a little bit on the capital deployment side about wanting to do more in M&A. Maybe the environment is not too friendly at the moment. But how are you thinking about priorities there? I know you guys have bought back some stock. You seem pretty comfortable with the leverage ratio. So maybe just talk through your priorities, M&A landscape, and then again, I mean, any targets on the leverage side with the debt would be helpful.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I -- you came -- the line came across not a little bit blurry, but if I understand you asked about capital deployment and acquisitions. Look, you saw that our cash flow performance was actually very strong in the quarter and that obviously helped continue to reduce our leverage. I think we have on a 12-month trailing basis, we ended the quarter at 3.25 times EBITDA, which is very good. I remind you, we were not too long ago in the high 4s, and we said that we were continuing to deliver naturally as EBITDA grows. Acquisitions, yeah, we would -- look, our long-term guidance always contemplates a couple of points of contribution from acquisitions to continue to boost our top line. So far, we've been able to do just over a point. Obviously, we have a rich pipeline and it's hard for me to predict what acquisition will be the second half or in the years to come. It's a binary outcome. So I don't know. I'm not sure if that was your question, but that's what I heard.
Operator: Your next question…
Kerri Joseph: Okay. This will be the last question, operator.
Operator: Understood. Your last question comes from the line of Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Matt Sykes: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ari, you mentioned the strong funding trends in the EBP segment at the same time you're still seeing some caution from large pharma. How should we think about the potential revenue mix-shift to VBP versus large pharma and would there be any implications for FSP versus full-service mix in that? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, first of all, when there is a timeline between funding and -- on RFP and then the timeline between an RFP and a booking. So if -- this is a business that has long cycles. So it's good that we have just as we were cautioning you not to panic when funding declines, and we said it's not going to affect us for a while. We don't get excited because funding this quarter was very strong. Yeah. It's good for our midterm and long-term prospects, but it's not like it's going to affect the mix. Also, we have a very large backlog, the largest in the industry. And it's not going to meaningfully change the mix of what we do in the next few quarters and what's large pharma, what's EBP, what's full-service versus what FSP. But you are correct that the more EBP, the more full-service, and that certainly helps mitigate the recent trend we've seen where, as we discussed in the past, large pharma has been swinging the pendulum a little bit more towards FSP as it has happened many times in the history of this industry. So you are correct, from that standpoint, that -- as more EBP funding is there, there'll be more EBP work in the quarters to come. And therefore, when that backlog converts into revenue, there'll be a higher mix of full-service versus FSP relative to what it is now. Thank you.
Operator: With no further time for questions, I now turn the call back over to Mr. Joseph.
Kerri Joseph: Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our third-quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. 
 Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference. 
Kerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
 Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. 
 Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. 
 In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib. 
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. 
 We had a strong start to the year. We delivered top and bottom line numbers on or slightly above our expectations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, our revenue grew 6%. We continue to see a favorable demand environment for our industry. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remain solid. Our backlog reached a new record and grew almost 8% versus prior year. 
 Net new bookings for the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.23. This included a substantial cancellation in the CNS area that is in the public domain, and I'm sure many of you are aware of. Excluding this large cancellation, which is well outside the typical cancellation size we see in a quarter, our first quarter book-to-bill ratio would have been over 1.3, actually closer to [ 1.35 ]. 
 Our quarterly RFP flow was up 6% year-over-year, and that's in value, meaning in dollar terms, and it was driven by mid- to high single-digit growth in all customer segments, again, in dollar terms. Our qualified pipeline grew double digits versus prior year, again, in value in dollar terms. Emerging biotech funding was very strong according to BioWorld, which we use consistently as a source. First quarter EBP funding was $47.1 billion, which is more than triple the funding of Q1 last year. 
 Shifting to TAS, our commercial side of our business, revenue in the quarter grew as expected. With the modest uptick in activity anticipated for later this year, we continue to forecast an improvement in the back half of the year. 
 We continue to see some favorable signs. For example, our pipeline remains strong. In our conversations with clients, there is more clarity on budgets, and we are starting to see faster decision timing with some clients compared to the second half of 2023. [ Now this ] said, the toll overall with our clients remains cautious. And the fact is that the uncertain macro environment persists as everyone can tell from the Fed's remarks yesterday.
 Turning now to the results for this quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including just over a point of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $862 million, and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $2.54. 
 I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity. Let's start with the TAS segment. You will have seen that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. The partnership will integrate innovation from IQVIA OCE with Salesforce's Life Sciences Cloud to provide customers with a new single end-to-end engagement platform, which is expected to be available late 2025. 
 This is very exciting news for the industry as we expect to transform the engagement with HCPs and with patients with the next-generation CRM platform that's built on OCE and that's powered by IQVIA data, domain expertise and advanced analytics. 
 Separately, and as we discussed in the past, that continues to be an evolution on the way in how the industry manages HCP and patient engagement. For example, there is an ongoing shift in HCP engagement from in-person to digital interactions. On the patient side, there is increased emphasis on direct-to-patient solutions through patient support and market access programs, including financial support, hub services, medical education. 
 As you know, we've been investing in building out these digital capabilities, and we are getting good market traction. For example, in the quarter, a top 3 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract for our smart engagement solution to understand the health care provider online journey across therapeutic areas and factor that in earlier into the drug development process. 
 A top 5 pharma bought IQVIA's Omnichannel Navigator solution to assess return on marketing investment, measure customer interactions and campaign performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies. 
 A global midsized pharma awarded IQVIA a multiyear contract to implement our commercial compliance solutions. These solutions will allow our clients' interactions with health care professionals to be in compliance with transparency, regulatory obligations in over 30 countries. 
 An EBP client bought IQVIA's patient relationship manager offering, which provides a comprehensive real-time view of the patient's journey and helps maximize the impact of their patient support program. 
 In general, the TAS segment is seeing more demand for our sophisticated technology-enabled analytics solutions. For example, in the quarter, a top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to streamline clinical operation data management processes. IQVIA's technology provides real-time data sharing, eliminating unnecessary file processing and improving the speed of data updates. 
 Also in the quarter, a large med tech firm bought the IQVIA offering that enables better stakeholder targeting and go-to-market execution, ultimately enhancing the clients' ROI. 
 Moving to real-world. A top 10 pharma company chose IQVIA to conduct a comparative study of the effectiveness of treatments against the standard of care in patients with a specific marker across 10 different cancers. The goal is to help the client gain market access and reimbursement for their treatment, which can be used for multiple types of cancer based on a single biomarker. 
 IQVIA was awarded contract by a top 10 pharma to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel eye movement technology, addressing a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis. 
 A top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA, a large real-world respiratory infection vaccine effectiveness study. We were selected based on our strong epidemiologic, scientific and therapeutic expertise as well as our global footprint to augment site identification and operational execution. 
 And finally, to conclude my commentary on the TAS segment, I'd like to highlight the work we're doing in public health. It's been an increased area of focus for governments looking to extend life expectancy, reduce health inequalities and improve overall quality of and access to care. 
 Some examples of IQVIA's work in this area, one of the largest UN health agencies contracted IQVIA to help with a major initiative to eradicate all types of polio viruses in Africa that focused on children. IQVIA is deploying personnel to improve outbreak response with vaccines and to strengthen polio surveillance and response in hard-to-reach areas. So far, IQVIA's team conducted visits to more than [ 12,000 ] sites and trained over 122,000 health workers across 26 African countries. 
 Another example of our work in this area, IQVIA was selected to conduct a large EU-funded project to create a national oncology network and database for one of the European's Ministry of Health to improve the country's low cancer survival rates. A single [ IT ] platform will connect national hospitals and the reimbursement fund in that country. The platform will leverage curated oncology data and analytics to manage patient risk and improve treatments in a cost-efficient manner. 
 Lastly, on public health, the Global Fund selected IQVIA to support 13 African countries to improve the visibility of their supply chain performance, ensure the availability of commodities and services, mitigate service disruptions and provide stronger assurance through more frequent on-site spot checks. 
 The project focuses on pharmaceutical and diagnostics analytics from over 2,800 facilities for tracer health products in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. This work is very important to us in public health. It's also extremely important to our global pharma clients, who are extremely active in this area as well. 
 Moving to R&DS. Let's start by highlighting 2 more distinguished vaccine development awards. A top 10 pharma selected IQVIA to support the development of a novel respiratory vaccine, which could represent a significant breakthrough as the only vaccine targeting multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. 
 IQVIA laboratory secured a preferred strategic partnership with a top 10 pharma based on IQVIA's unique expertise, innovation and delivery model. As we discussed in the past, there is stronger demand for FSP services, and we continue to win our fair share in this segment as well. For example, in the quarter, we secured an extension of FSP data management services with a leading midsized pharma known for their innovative rare blood disease therapies. 
 In the EBP segment, we secured 2 large awards, where we displaced incumbent CROs based on our global scale and AI-enabled capabilities. We were selected by a U.S. West Coast EBP client to conduct 2 large Phase III oncology studies simultaneously. This is a big deal as the client is new to IQVIA and selected us based on our differentiated AI-enabled capabilities as the trial protocol includes complex inclusion, exclusion criteria and usually large patient cohorts and aggressive enrollment timelines. 
 We also won another large EBP full-service Phase III trial, displacing the incumbent, again, by leveraging our AI-enabled startup, site identification, activation and enrollment capabilities. 
 With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. 
Ronald Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.737 billion, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were approximately $45 million, down about $105 million versus first quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. As already mentioned, acquisitions contributed just over 100 basis points to this growth. 
 Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.453 billion, up 0.6% reported and 1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 3%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2.095 billion that was up 3.4% reported and 3.8% in constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 8%. 
 Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first quarter revenue of $189 million was up 3.8% reported and 7.1% at constant currency. 
 Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $862 million. That's growth of 1.3%. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $288 million, down 0.3% year-over-year; and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.56, up 2% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $468 million for the quarter, up 1.3% year-over-year, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 3.7% to [ $2.54 ]. 
 Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $30.1 billion, which was 7.9% up year-over-year. And next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.7 [ billion ], growing 6.1% year-over-year. 
 Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.444 billion. Gross debt was $13.536 billion, and the result of those two is net debt of $12.092 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.38x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $522 million, and capital expenditures were $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $377 million. 
 Turning now to guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance on a constant currency basis. We are adjusting revenue at actual currency downward by $75 million to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last guided. We now expect revenue to be between $15.325 billion and $15.575 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 2.3% to 3.9% on a reported basis. 
 Now this guidance now includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 100 basis points. And I'll remind you that when we last guided, we were looking for about 50 basis points of FX headwind. 
 We continue to assume approximately $300 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 100 basis points of contribution to revenue from M&A activity. We're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.7% to 6.5%. The impact of FX changes to revenue had a negligible impact on EBITDA. 
 We're also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $10.95 to $11.25, up 7.4% to 10.3% versus the prior year.
 Okay. Let me conclude by providing second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.740 billion and [ $3.815 billion ]. This includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points, and we anticipate the second quarter will be the toughest quarterly FX compare of the year. As a reminder, the step-down in COVID-related work is weighted towards the first half of the year. 
 Also, we continue to expect gradual improvement in TAS revenue growth in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between [ $870 million ] and [ $890 million ], and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.54 and $2.64. And all of the guidance I provided assumes that foreign currency rates, as of April 30, continue for the balance of the year.
 So to summarize, Q1 was a strong start to the year. TAS revenue came in as expected, and we continue to look for improvement in the back end of the year. R&DS delivered $2.6 billion of net bookings, bringing backlog to over $30 billion for the first time in our history. 
 We continue to see favorable forward-looking indicators in the clinical trial business, such as strong RFP flow, strong qualified pipeline growth and strong biotech funding. And finally, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year, including adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.4% to 10.3%.
 With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI.
 Ms. Anderson, your line is open. You may have yourself muted. 
Ari Bousbib: Let's move on to the next one in the queue, operator. 
Operator: We'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I wanted to ask a little bit about the large cancellation that you called out. You absorbed it into the numbers. Could you give us a little bit more specificity in terms of highlighting what kind of impact would be to revenue or/and also to bookings? Because you're [ rolling ] the revenue due to FX, but you're also absorbing an incremental cancellation that's unusual. And maybe that could help us a little bit with the context over there and then also on the booking side. 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we don't normally speak to cancellations. As you know, we just provide net new bookings. I might point out, by the way, that we [ haven't ] speak to it, but our gross bookings were the highest -- the second highest in our history before cancellations. 
 Now, the reason we highlighted this cancellation is because, look, a typical cancellation is normally in the $15 million, $20 million kind of range. And this one is very, very large. It's almost -- it's about $0.25 billion, okay? So we have done that in the past whenever we've had an unusual cancellation. This one has been in the news. I think everyone knows what we are talking about. And we wanted to reassure everyone that the underlying business continues to be very strong. 
 With respect to absorbing it, yes. I mean, look, we are a large company. We are, at any given point in time, working on around 2,500 clinical trials. These are staggered and staged through the year, and revenue flows over several years for each one of those trials. So we are large enough, global enough that we can absorb even such a large cancellation. No change to the guidance. And as Ron pointed out and you reminded us in your question, the adjustment is entirely due to FX. 
Ronald Bruehlman: Shlomo, just one thing, I would jump in there. I think you're asking about revenue, too. And obviously, because with an ongoing trial, it does have some impact to our revenue in the current year. But we're absorbing that in our normal numbers. And this is a series of trials, actually a program that would play out over many years. So there isn't an outsized impact in this year. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Max Smock at William Blair. 
Max Smock: Maybe just following up on [ RFP  flows ] that you saw in the quarter. You mentioned up mid- to high single digits across all customer groups. I think last quarter, you had called out up double digits across all customer groups. 
 So I just wanted to get a sense for whether what you saw in terms of RFP flows going into this quarter was in line with your expectations? And then, any thoughts on how we should think about book-to-bill, moving forward? 
Ari Bousbib: Again, I wouldn't read a lot in the variation quarter-to-quarter. Just as an example, the RFP flow last year was flat versus the [ '22 ] number. So we think this is very good. It's consistent with our expectations. The large segment, the large pharma was up more in the high single digits in terms of RFP flow. EBP was a little bit higher than that at kind of mid-single growth, depends on the therapies. We had a lot of bookings, infectious diseases and internal medicine, which drove a lot of the growth there. 
 The [ awards ] grew well into the teens. So we often look at awards. We report contracted bookings. As you know, some of our peers report awards, which is at an earlier stage in the in the process. And maybe just to reassure you that we haven't come down from what we said at the last quarter as a leading indicator, if you will, awards were up in the double digits and that was driven by large full-service trials, strong EBP as well. 
 We look at the qualified pipeline, and the qualified pipeline is up double digits, actually very strong double digits. And it's up again at a record high. So nothing here that has changed versus our expectations. 
Operator: We'll go next to Anne Samuel at JPMorgan. 
Anne McCormick: In the TAS business, you talked about strength in the pipeline and some positive signs and maybe some more positive conversations there. As you're moving through the year, are you seeing your pipeline convert kind of at the same rate that you had initially expected? And with the macro maybe slightly more stable, can you just maybe speak to any potential areas of upside as things are starting to loosen up there? 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, I mean, I wouldn't talk about upside here so far. And then the macro is not really stabilizing, unless you call stabilizing [ the fact ] that we now know there won't be a rate cut anytime soon. 
 So look, the TAS business is exactly performing exactly as we expected it, same type of performance that we telegraphed in our prior guidance, same growth rate that we anticipated when you exclude COVID and the currency impact. And we continue to see -- again, based on our pipeline, based on budgets [ firming ] up, based on the conversation with clients; continue to expect upside towards the back of the year, second half of the year and more in the back of the year. 
 Large pharma companies, as you know, have introduced significant cost reduction programs. And that has driven a lot more cautiousness and scrutiny in the budgets than in prior years. And we've discussed, this is driven by the overall macro environment, maybe some concerns related to IRA long term and preservation of margins. 
 As you know, our client base generally is doing fairly well and is reporting very good numbers. So we think that also is an encouraging sign. And usually, our clients have more propensity to spend when they -- when they are out, we are out. And we see that they are doing well. So all of those signs are encouraging. 
 I could give you a little bit of color on the business in TAS, just for a perspective. The data business continues to perform exactly as expected. No surprises, they are flattish to up the low single digits. 
 The real-world business, which we signaled in the prior quarter earnings call, was slowing down, has actually gone from being a very strong double-digit growth performer to mid-single digits to then negative growth in the fourth quarter, has rebounded somewhat and is now flattish. So we see that we think that we bottom out there. 
 And the tech business continues to perform as expected, good and strong. And the analytics and consulting business, which is our shortest cycle business, ebbs and flows in the quarter. It had started to do a little better last quarter. This quarter, it went backwards, and that's why we didn't perform even better than our expectations in TAS. 
 So all in all, real-world doing better than we thought. And analytics and consulting doing a little less than we thought, but that's kind of to be expected. It has more variability by definition. And we still have a strong pipeline there. So we think that, that will continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And that's what gives us confidence that the back end of the year on TAS, we will be good. Again, upside, I don't know. I can't promise that. 
Operator: We'll move to our next question from David Windley at Jefferies. 
David Windley: I wanted to transition you to R&DS. You highlighted in your prepared remarks about some of the business wins, you highlighted some FSP deals. I also heard you say though that your RFP flow was strong on the full-service side. 
 So given that you've talked in the past about how that FSP does present some margin headwinds, I thought maybe you could update us on the state of play between those 2 models and maybe we've reached some kind of equilibrium there. So just your thoughts on FSP versus [ FSO ]. 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look as a percentage of our total R&DS revenue, [ FSP ] comprised about 15%. So now, if you -- that's in totality. If you look only at the services portion of the business, meaning excluding pass-throughs, which, as you know in FSP, there typically is no pass-throughs; so that percentage is a little higher and continues, it's a little less somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would say. And it continues to grow a point or 2 every year. 
 So of course, it has an impact on margins because FSP margins -- FSP [ contracts ] come at lower margins. But again, we are a large global company, and that just puts more pressure on us to continue to operate with more efficiency, find new areas of productivity, contain costs and offset those margins, those mix -- those unfavorable mix impacts on margins with cost reductions, and we continue to work well on our usual playbook, which is to grow our EBITDA faster than our revenue and consequently increase margins. 
Operator: We'll go next to Jailendra Singh at Truist Securities. 
Jailendra Singh: I wanted to follow up on the Salesforce partnership comments. Just curious, if you can share any initial reaction from your OCE customers post that announcement? Or is it still early? 
 Also just curious, like what were the conversations leading up to the partnership? Trying to understand what drove the decision to partner with Salesforce, given what IQVIA has seen, what [ HCPs ] prefer for engagement in terms of digital marketing, et cetera. 
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, as you know, we've carved out a nice position in the global CRM market for Life Sciences, we came from behind much later in the game. I guess we entered the market more than 10 years after the large dominant incumbent in this market. And today, we have a footprint of over 400 clients and about 100,000 seats in the business, which is quite impressive in a few short years. 
 Now what happened here is that a dominant competitor has announced a re-platforming of their product from Salesforce to their own in-house platform. Now OCE is based on a Salesforce platform. It's the result of a strategic partnership that has been in the market for over 5 years. And we and Salesforce want to ensure that we continue to have the best product in the market. And we've agreed that it is time to develop the next-generation product. 
 We also agreed that it should be based on Salesforce's new Life Science Cloud, which is much more advanced. And as it will be based on the current OCE application to be re-platformed. Now it takes time to do that. It makes sense for Salesforce to take the lead in developing this next-generation application, and it will be based on IQVIA [ IP ]. 
 Our existing customers understand all of that. They will continue to be supported for at least the next 5 years, and they are very happy. I can even say yesterday, we won a very significant award on OCE with a large, well-known client, pharma client, and we actually displaced the large dominant player in the space, which have been the incumbent for a long time. 
 So our clients are reacting very favorably. They understand the need for the next-generation transition, and we are going to shepherd that process together with Salesforce. When the product is ready the next 2 years or so, we will go to market jointly with Salesforce with this new product platform, and we will help transition customers who wish to do so when they are ready to do so. Strong and positive reaction from the customer base. 
Operator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes at Mizuho Securities. 
Ann Hynes: Ari, wondering what surprised you on the upside most in the quarter and maybe on the downside? And just following up on the last FSP question, thank you for that clarity, you gave us about its 20% to 25% ex pass-throughs. What do you think the max would be over time? 
Ari Bousbib: What was the first part? 
Ann Hynes: What surprised to you on the... 
Ari Bousbib: I hate to be boring. I had zero surprises this quarter. I mean, for lack of better words, I think this was a boring quarter. It was exact -- it came in exactly as we thought. Look, the nature of business is pretty predictable. The large cancellation was kind of -- it's based on -- really on the results and on the assessment of the environment by the clients. It's always been very well reported. 
 And so it usually takes time to unwind the study. And so we knew it was coming. So those -- we know the exact timing when all of this would be finalized, but [ it was ] in the quarter. 
 But other than that, frankly, no surprises [ up at the helm ]. Everything came in pretty much on expectations. There always are moving parts, but this was one of the most boring quarters I've seen, nothing -- no drop. That's the way we like it, by the way. 
 In terms of your FSP question, it ebbs and flows. I remember my first contacts with this business now almost 8 years ago, I was told FSP is going to be replacing full service, clients are shifting to FSP. And indeed, there was, very similar to today, an effort by some of the large pharma companies, many of them, to bring project management in-house and to essentially shift to these types of models. So I think it's a pendulum. It swings back and forth. 
 In a highly specialized studies, it's very hard for a client not to do full service because they don't always have all the competencies in-house. Again, I think we're seeing similar trends as we saw 8 years ago. What we're seeing also might be -- to add a little bit more to this, we're seeing a trend towards what we call hybrid models, where the client starts out with one thing, an FSP program. And as we progress in defining the parameters of the study, we end up taking on more of the tasks. 
 And it's kind of in between full service. And it's not fully outsourced. But in that, they [ aren't ]100% FSP either. They're parts of the program that we continue to manage. So it's really more integration with the client, and it becomes more of a closer partnership. 
 So I don't see this as a long-term permanent trend to the point where, theoretically, it will become 100% FSP. I don't see that happening. Plus remember, FSP is virtually nonexistent for EBP or midsized pharma. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin at Bank of America. 
John Kim: This is John Kim on for Mike. I appreciate the FSP comment there. I'll just ask a quick one. On that swing pendulum comment, do you expect that percentage to go down at some point? And in terms of the RFP flows, that sounds great, solid, solid flows. But is there anything that may hinder or delay that turning into sales in the second half? 
Ari Bousbib: Okay, thank you. Well, on the FSP comment, I don't know when these things will -- this is a long-cycle business. I remind you that it takes an average 4, 5 years to execute a contract. So we have a very large book of business. I think in our backlog, what is the proportion of that FSP backlog? Is it also about 15%? 
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. 
Ari Bousbib: Yes, so our backlog is over $30 billion, and about like somewhere worth $4 billion -- $4.5 billion of that is FSP. So you see the vast majority of the revenue we're going to deliver over the next 4 or 5 years is going to continue to be full-service programs, and it's not about to influence one way or the other. 
 It's a slow-moving business. It takes a lot to move the needle one way or the other. We've been continuously on an upward momentum, and that's the way we like it. So no, I don't see that happening. And then certainly the same similar type of commentary on your question about affecting the second half, it is just too short horizon to have an impact. These swings will have an impact [ 4 ] years from now. 
Operator: We'll go next to Charles Rhyee at TD Cowen. 
Charles Rhyee: Ari, you mentioned earlier about winning an [ EBP ] client that's going to do 2 simultaneous studies in oncology. And I'm curious whether decision to do 2 trials at once could be a function of terms in the IRA that kind of benefit companies to do -- the [ local ] trials that want sort of to maximize revenue before potential negotiating on pricing with Medicare. I'm curious if that could be part of the reason. And in general, I guess, as you think about the structure of IRA, do you foresee more companies engaging in multiple trials at the start? And how do you think that could be benefiting for IQVIA in the future? 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, I mean that's a clever thought here why it was 2 [ material ] studies, but it happens to be not the case over here. But -- I see what you're thinking about, but that's not the case here. These are 2 different -- it's addressing 2 different diseases with different -- I think it's different molecules. Again, we can give you in post call some more color on this, but I don't think it's because of the IRA. 
 Look, what is true is that clients are, with respect to the IRA, trying to accelerate timelines because one of the possible impacts of the IRA is that it will reduce the period of time during which protection will apply -- intellectual property protection will apply. 
 And as a result, you want to maximize the revenues then, that, if anything -- and again, that's probably the context for your question, if anything, that kind of induce clients to launch several programs simultaneously. So in this particular case, we're replacing an incumbent, and I think one of them is a rescue study, if I am correct. So that's the context there. 
Operator: We'll go next to Tejas Savant at Morgan Stanley. 
Tejas Savant: Ari, I have a few questions here on R&D Solutions. First, just broadly on the pricing environment, are you starting to see more pricing discipline from your peers versus what you saw in the back half of '23? 
 Second, on the cancellation in [ CNS ], given the faster burn nature of that work, is there any implication from that for the phasing of R&D revenue through the remainder of '24? 
 And then last on AI enablement. You highlighted that as a driver of some of your EBP wins in the quarter, which I thought was quite interesting. Could you just share some color on why it's translating into share gain for you? And what is it you can do with AI that your peers aren't offering yet? 
Ari Bousbib: Okay. The three questions are totally independent. So first on pricing. Look, there's no change in pricing here. There continues to be pressure from clients, and price negotiations are always tough. We mentioned before that we're having maybe more pressure than we had before on pricing from large pharma clients as they're working on their savings initiatives, but it's not that different than history, maybe a little more than usual. 
 But I think nothing -- with respect to competitors, I can't speak to what they do, I just have no idea, I don't want to know. But look, comes to reason that smaller competitors which have failed largely and have led to them being acquired, are struggling to book business and as a result, could put pressure on pricing. But nothing there that I can signal that's unusual versus what we spoke about in the past. 
 Your second question was on cancellation. We spoke before, we address that. No, look, it's a very large cancellation. And yes, it has an impact on revenues over the next few years, including in this year. But we said earlier that we are a large company, and we are absorbing it in our guidance. It's fine. 
 So yes, if you will, it would have been better if we hadn't -- if the program hasn't canceled. But it's okay, we're not changing the guidance for that. Our only guidance adjustment, again, is 100% related to foreign currency. 
 With respect to your third question on AI, look, AI has -- not saying anything shocking here, AI has a massive amount of opportunity, in general, and I would say, perhaps more limited than people think in health care because data, the ingredients, if you will, are not readily available publicly. 
 You can search for medical literature for diagnostics, you could look for jurisprudence for legal opinions. But frankly, to identify patients that are best suited for trials, sites that need to be identified for maximum effectiveness and fastest enrollment, that's really, really tough to get information. And if you ask those questions to a chatbot, you are not going to get the answers. 
 However, once you are within our environment, then that's a lot more possible. And so if you think about it, the entire premise of what we set out to do when we merged Quintiles and IMS 8 years ago, was precisely to leverage massive amounts of data and analytics and technology to accelerate clinical development timelines, particularly applicable to oncology, rare disease and difficult-to-enroll patients. 
 With the [ advance ] of AI, that set of initiatives becomes even easier. And we've been at it for a while, this is not new to us. But some of the new tools, as you can imagine, are put to good use within our environment, and some of the wins we've had are the direct results of those capabilities. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Luke Sergott at Barclays. 
Luke Sergott: I just kind of want to get a better sense of how to think about the TAS recovery and more on discretionary in the commercial side, so -- and how it relates to drug approvals and things like that. So we only had 10 approvals in this quarter versus 15 last quarter, but we're already starting to see a strong start to April. 
 I'm just trying to get a sense of when pharma starts engaging you guys for work and when you start seeing those bookings and then ultimately when it starts flowing through, I know it's different for particular regions, but as the approvals start coming in and accelerating, how to think about the growth in the discretionary pieces that have been slower? 
Ari Bousbib: Look, I wish I had a crystal ball here, and I've been wrong before on predicting a comeback, if you will, of the TAS business. So I'll be cautious in my commentary. 
 You're right to point to the approvals. I mean, the number of approvals, as you know, in last year, I think there were 55 approvals last year. And that's -- that was I think a record year. It was certainly a very high level, almost 50% more than the prior year and the highest level since, I think, must be '17 or '18. 
 Now the new launches and the spend associated with these new launches usually is up significantly for the 5 years that follow these approvals. So we do expect the TAS business to be strong. The wild card is when those launches occur, what clients decide to do. The -- about 50% of the new [ launch ] spend usually occurs within the first 2 years. So again, it happens over the following 5 years and usually the first 2 years. 
 I mean, yes, quarter-to-quarter, it was only 10 this quarter. But we think in general, just with the approvals of last year, we should see a rebound coming in. And that's one of the reasons we are somewhat confident that the TAS business will be rebounding more strongly, and the real uptick will come next year. But we see -- given that it has bottomed out here, and we think it has reached the bottom, and we anticipate an improvement in the balance of the year. 
 The pipeline is higher than it has ever been, frankly. And we scrub this pipeline continuously, we continue to see improvement in customer sentiment. In Q1, the tone is better, there are more opportunities that have surfaced. This increased optimism for the outlook in '24. 
 What happened in the second half of last year in conversations with clients is the budgets became -- we are aware of what clients can spend because they [indiscernible] budget, but the budget got trimmed sometime towards the end of the year, and there was quite a bit of [ uncertainty ] as people were negotiating internally. 
 We feel there is more clarity now on budgets, and that helps a lot with confidence for awards in the balance of the year. Also decisions, we measure decision timeline, and that -- those timelines have started to come down and get reduced, which is a favorable sign. 
Luke Sergott: All right. So I guess there's like basically between -- obviously, there's going to be a big difference there in timing, but like safe to assume between like 6 and 12 months lag post an approval of when you actually start working on the launch with the drug company and the commercialization efforts? 
Ari Bousbib: That's correct. 
Operator: Yes. That does conclude our Q&A at this time. Mr. Joseph, I'll turn the call back over to you. 
Kerri Joseph: Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our second quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions that you'll have. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2023 results. You saw that we had a good quarter. Let me start the call by sharing the latest of what we are seeing in our end markets, along with our key accomplishments for 2023. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remained strong. Net new bookings for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, the second largest quarter in IQVIA history, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.31. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 13% year-over-year, driven by EBP and large pharma. Our qualified pipeline grew double-digits versus prior year. Emerging biotech funding was strong. According to BioWorld, fourth quarter EBP funding was $21.6 billion, the highest quarter in the last two years continuing the sequential improvement we've seen throughout the year. For the full year, EBP funding for 2023 was $70.9 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and that represents the largest year on record, if we exclude the outlier years of 2020 and 2021, when there was dramatic outstanding due to COVID. As we close 2023, we're proud of what we have achieved in R&DS. The business booked $10.7 billion of net new business, including record high service bookings of $8.4 billion. Our backlog stands at $29.7 billion, and that's up 9% year-over-year. The business added nearly 400 net new customers in the year. We made great progress with our clinical research strategies. We significantly expanded our R&D site network and management organization through strategic acquisitions that offer clinical research coordination study feasibility and patient recruitment capability. We further expanded the capabilities of the lab business through the launch of a new synthetic antibody discovery offering, which is differentiated from the traditional animal-derived antibodies that are used by our competitors. And we partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, who enhance the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases in underdeveloped countries. Turning to TAS. The commercial side of our business continues, of course, to face the macro environment that we've described in the past as our clients remain cautious with their spending and their cost containment. Our results in the quarter were slightly better than what we had expected. Although, discretionary spending has not yet rebounded to the levels that we expect, they will, and it continues to be a headwind. Fundamentally, leading market indicators do point to an upcoming improvement. For instance, the FDA approved 55 new molecules in 2023 and that's almost 50% more than the prior year and it is the highest level since 2018. The spend on new drug launches by our pharma clients is expected to be over $190 billion over the next five years. That's up over 25% compared to the prior five-year period. Frankly, in our own engagement with customers in the recent past, we noted an improved customer sentiment during the quarter. In fact, the pipeline of opportunities remains strong even as decision time lines remain elongated and negotiations more difficult similar to what we indicated last quarter. Based on these dynamics, we continue to expect demand to pick up, but not before the second half of the year. And as a result, we may see the 2024 sequential short trend for TAS to be the inverse of what we experienced in 2023. We might see revenue growth in the first quarter that resembles the growth of the fourth quarter of 2023 and grow to gradually improve as we move to the back end of the year. Now despite more difficult macro environment, the TAS business had some significant achievements in 2023. We continued expanding our commercial technology and analytics offerings. We, in fact, added 33 new clients on our OCE technology platform. We successfully launched a new software platform, which tracks the performance of 1.6 million drugs covering 600 diseases across 93 countries. We successfully introduced a first-in-kind med tech consumption offering that supports the complex journey that medical devices take as they travel from manufacturer to health care providers. And we acquired a quality metric to extend our suite of patient health measurement tools using clinical outcome assessments and patient reported outcomes. Let me now turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% at constant currency compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, reflecting our ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.84 faced the continuing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate increase. Excluding the impact of these items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth was 11%. Now, a few highlights of this business activity this quarter. Let's start with TAS. The midsized pharma client awarded IQVIA, a four-year outsourcing program to support their life cycle strategy of converting established brands to over-the-counter sales in more than 40 countries. Similarly, IQVIA won a four-year contract with a large pharma client to provide global market intelligence via a single globally accessible source of commercial data. In the quarter, we won a significant contract with a large pharma in the dermatology, rheumatology and oncology therapeutic areas. This program will allow our clients to access detailed prescribing patterns in local markets, and enhanced HCP targeting in 18 countries. The CDC selected IQVIA to provide comprehensive monitoring services following the end of the COVID public health emergency status. IQVIA will support the CDC in analyzing data in near real time. On the respiratory virus response, including for influenza and RSV, identifying at-risk groups and improving overall population health. In the quarter, our Patient Services business, which is showing faster growth within our past segment, secured a significant contract with a large pharma that includes adherence monitoring, co-pay support and at-home treatment administration. In our real-world business, the National Health Service of England awarded IQVIA, a large contract to deploy our privacy technology and to enable the NHS efforts to ensure the highest standards of patient data governance and privacy controls. Moving to RDS, a top 5 pharma client selected IQVIA as a key clinical FSP provider. Noteworthy here is that, a competitor of ours had been the 100% sole provider previously. This partnership will help the client improve clinical trial oversight and manage costs more effectively. In Q4, another top 5 clients awarded IQVIA a full-service Phase 2 study on ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. IQVIA was selected due to our vast expertise in ALS disease as well as our faster recruitment time lines. In the quarter, a biotech client selected IQVIA to conduct a complex trial for a promising cell and gene therapy targeting myositis, which is an autoimmune disease. We were selected due to our AI capabilities that allow us to identify sites and develop an innovative trial strategy. Also in the quarter, IQVIA expanded its partnership with a major pharma company by securing six new global oncology trials, consisting of a mix of early and late-stage trials. We were chosen due to our expertise in oncology and our ability to efficiently manage large complex trials. A leading biotech firm, selected IQVIA to conduct a program comprised of three initial stage studies in cancer research. The client is expanding from local to global development and needed a large-scale partner like IQVIA. In Q4, IQVIA was awarded a major contract from a top 10 global pharma to become its primary pharmacovigilance platform provider. This multiyear program includes replacing their legacy systems with IQVIA's drug safety monitoring technology which uses generative AI capability to automatically extract adverse event information from unstructured data sources. Finally, and before I turn it to Ron for a detailed financial review, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company just received. For the seventh consecutive year, IQVIA was named one of the world's most admired companies in Fortune's annual survey. And for the third year in a row, IQVIA was named the number one most admired company in our category. Lastly, before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to specifically mention the prestigious recognition received by Christina Mack one of IQVIA's senior leaders, who is the Chief Scientific Officer for our real-world business. Christina was named 2023 PharmaVoice 100 honorary, is a peer-recognized industry-wide honor. We are very proud at IQVIA of Christina's work and our passion for accelerating innovation in health care through the use of evidence-based decision-making. Let me now turn it to Ron for our financial review.
Ronald Bruehlman: Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of$3.868 billion grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $65 million, which was down about $125 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Now excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. And as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.531 billion, up 2.1% reported and 1.3% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 4%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.151 billion was up 4.5% reported and 3.7% at constant currency and excluding all COVID related where constant currency growth and R&DS was 9% in the quarter. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $186 million grew 2.2% reported and 1.7% at constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $14.984 billion, growing at 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $420 million for the year. Excluding all COVID-related work from both years, constant currency growth was 9%. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.862 billion, up 2% reported, 2.1% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. In R&D Solutions full year revenue was $8.395 billion, growing 6%, both on a reported and a constant currency basis, and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 13%. Finally, in CSMS revenue for the full year was $727 million, which was down 2.2% reported and 0.3% at constant currency. Okay. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $966 million for the fourth quarter. That represented 5% growth, while full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.569 billion, which was up 6.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $469 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.54. For the full year, GAAP net income was $1.358 billion, or $7.29 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.901 billion in adjusted diluted EPS was $10.20. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another really strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $29.7 billion. That's up 9.2% year-over-year and 31% over the last three years. Okay. Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.376 billion and gross debt was $13.673 billion. And due to the math that results in net debt of $12.297 billion, our net leverage ratio at year-end was 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $747 million and capital expenditures was $179 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $568 million for the quarter. Now in the quarter, we repurchased $229 million of our shares at an average price of $1.95 per share bringing our full year share repurchase activity to just slightly below $1 billion. This leaves us with just under $2.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now as you know, coming out of the merger, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and deployed a significant amount of capital for internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchases, which were quite accretive for our shareholders. Now, over that period, our net interest expense was relatively steady at around $400 million per year, but at the end of 2022 and through the middle of 2023, we experienced a rapid and unprecedented rise in interest rates, which drove annual interest expense, up by almost $0.25 billion causing our adjusted EPS to be just slightly over flat in 2023. Now, as you saw in November, we successfully refinanced approximately $2.75 billion of our near-term debt maturities. The strong demand for IQVIA debt that we experienced allowed us to tighten pricing and lock in an average fixed rate below 4.9% for those issuances after swaps. This refinancing extended approximately $2.75 billion of maturities to 2029 and 2031 and we reduced our interest rate risk exposure by locking in over 80% of our debt at fixed rates. With this refinancing, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $650 million in 2024. Now, the forward curves point to a reduction in rates in the future. We've included the current market consensus in our 2024 guidance. Further reductions would lower our net interest expense more on our variable rate debt and potentially open opportunities to refinance additional debt in the future. Now let's go to our 2024 guidance, which I'll review in detail. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be between $15.400 billion and $15.650 billion, this includes approximately $300 million of a step-down in COVID-related work year-over-year and about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and further FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points versus 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.700 billion to $3.800 billion. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.95 to $11.25. Now this guidance includes about $650 million of interest expense. Approximately $580 million of operational depreciation and amortization expense, an effective income tax rate, just under 20% and an average diluted share count of approximately 184 million shares. This guidance also assumes about $2 billion deployment split evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. Now at the segment level, we expect TAS revenue to be between $6 billion and $6.2 billion. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that we had significant COVID-related revenues in TAS. So the COVID step down in TAS will be minimal for the balance of the year. As already mentioned, the guidance now anticipates an improvement in our commercial business towards the back end of the year, which will still result in a year-over-year growth of low to mid-single-digits. R&DS revenue is expected to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. This guidance includes almost the entire $300 million step down in COVID-related revenue. And that represents approximately 350 basis points of headwind to the R&DS growth rate. The guidance also reflects the latest phasing of pass-through revenue which results in an additional headwind of approximately 100 basis points to R&DS year-over-year. Adjusting for the COVID step-down in the pass-through headwind, R&DS revenue growth in 2024 is expected to remain in the high single-digits. CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million, which is down slightly year-over-year. Now, let's review the first quarter guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.650 billion and $3.725 billion. The decline in COVID-related work is weighted towards the beginning of the year with the largest impact in Q1. Also, we expect mark conditions and TAS to recover only in the back half of the year, as we've said. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be between $850 million and $870 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.45 and $2.55. Now keep in mind that Q1 is the toughest comparison for adjusted diluted EPS due to the interest rate increases we saw throughout 2023. As we mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. So let's summarize. Q4 was another strong quarter. R&DS delivered the second largest booking quarter in IQVIA history at over $2.8 billion, along with another quarter of double-digit RFC growth. For the full year of 2023, revenue grew 9% at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% you exclude the year-over-year impact of interest rates and the increase in the UK tax rate. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $568 million, representing 109% of adjusted net income. IQVIA was named to Fortune's 2023 list of the World's most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year and earned the first place ranking within our industry group for the third consecutive year. And lastly, we issued full year 2024 guidance with underlying revenue growth of 5% to 7%, continued margin expansion and a resumption of EPS growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to be up 7% to 10%. Now, before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of the leadership change within IQVIA's finance organization, Nick Childs, who has led our Investor Relations and treasury functions very ably for the past three years, is moving on to become CFO of our North American business. He will be succeeded by Kerry Joseph, who has served as CFO of that business unit for the past five years. Kerry, who is a member of the global finance leadership team has had many finance roles of increasing responsibility during his 20-plus years with the company. Kerry and Nick have already been working together to transition responsibilities and Kerry will join Nick on our follow-up calls this quarter, so you all have a chance to meet them. Now, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anne Samuel from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Anne Samuel: Hi, guys. Congrats on the great present and thanks for taking the question. My first question was just on TAS. You spoke to expectations for a back half recovery in this business. It seems like based on your comments and some of those from others at our recent conference that others in the life sciences IT space are seeing some early optimism around that. And I was just wondering what do you expect to be the early indicators that the recovery is happening in that business? And what part of your TAS business will maybe start to see the first green shoots?
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you, Anne. I mean, look, we -- early last year, we're expecting that things would turn around second half of last year. And as you know, it didn't happen. Now it's got to happen at some point. So, we then thought, well, by the second quarter of later -- at the end of last year's third quarter, I thought, okay, second quarter of 2024. We are now expecting this to happen second half. And in support of all of these, I mentioned some data points in my introductory remarks. Look, the FDA approved 50% more molecules than last year and is the highest level since 2018. That really generally bodes well for the commercial business as our clients prepare for launching those drugs into the marketplace. And those launches come for significant support from the type of services that we provide, whether it's data launch consulting, planning, market access, pricing support and so on and so forth. And in fact, our own market expectations of spend by pharma over the next few years, compares very favorably to the prior period. Now, in our own conversations with clients, we're noting more optimism on the outlook for 2024. But perhaps because we've been hurt before, we've tried to be appropriately cautious in planning. And really, when we build up the forecast for our TAS business based on the pipeline, I might note, I don't think we said that before or even if we report any of these numbers here, but we have a pipeline of opportunities with a very detailed methodology that's been proven over time. And I can tell you that our pipeline for the year for the 2024 year is higher than it has ever been on the TAS business. So that gives us comfort that the forecast is appropriately built and hopefully, we'll be -- we have upside favorability if things work out perfectly well. But we've built enough caution on the forecast here that we feel good about the TAS business for 2024 as we presented it. Now, a word of caution, the business saw a decline in growth through 2023 with every quarter being worse than the previous one. We expect 2024 to be sort of the mirror image of that. That is the first quarter to be more like last year's fourth quarter and the second quarter more like the third quarter, et cetera, with the ramp up through the year and hopefully building momentum as we progress through 2024.
Anne Samuel: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe on the R&DS side. I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little bit of color on just how to think about the cadence for 2024. I'm just given all the moving pieces. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: You mean the cadence? Yes, anyone has any
Anne Samuel: The cadence of revenue yes.
Ari Bousbib: Yes.
Nicholas Childs: Yes, I mean I think you I mean I guess I would tell you to look at the linearity that you've seen in prior years -- any sort of drop off or a significant pickup either no.
Anne Samuel: Great. Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Ari, can you talk a little bit about the significant contract signings in the quarter? A second largest in the company's history, were there certain really large deals that maybe boosted it? Were there certain therapeutic areas that might have boosted it? Maybe just give us a little bit of color about that.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well, thank you, Shlomo, for the question. There was no specific contract or particular award or anything like that. I would just say that, by segment, the EBP segment was particularly strong. I mentioned funding was very strong in the quarter. The highest on record. Again, if you exclude the COVID years. And so EBP was particularly strong. I'd say with -- again, we don't talk about book-to-bill per segment, but the EBP book-to-bill, if you will, was higher than our 1.31. So, comparatively, we had -- and I would say about 25%. Is that correct, guys? 25% of our bookings in the year were EBP. So that's a little bit of color that I can give you. But nothing -- no one time big award or anything that skewed the numbers pretty strong across the board.
Nicholas Childs: Therapeutic area we continue to excel in oncology and cell and gene therapy in a complex clinical trial, no change.
Ari Bousbib: Right. Correct.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. Is there -- can you just comment anything about competitively in the marketplace? Has there been any changes? I know it's a long cycle business. Anything you could talk about either on TAS or R&DS with any of the well-known competitors that are out there?
Ari Bousbib: Well, I don't generally like to comment on competitors. But yes, there have been a number of disruptions sort of company is being acquired or spun off in the CRO space. And that always introduces some level of disruption. I mean some of these companies have been in trouble. The fact that, they've been acquired by private equity or conversely spun off in the public markets. Does that mean that they'll be more competitive, less competitive? It's hard to tell. It's disruption often. Often, happens. If you take a longer view of this question, we believe that our merger seven years ago, significantly disrupted the industry and led to a large number of subsequent transactions which resulted from what we believe was reactions to the clear competitive advantage that we think we established that enabled us over the past few years to gradually gain market share. But other than that, I mean, I don't have any further comments.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Tejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good morning. So my first question here is on the R&D side of things. Ari, can you help us think through just a shift in mix in FSP versus hybrid versus full service work and the margin implications of that? And similarly, sort of any shift in the mix of work as you head into 2024 on therapeutic area basis? And what that means -- what that might for your backlog burn rates?
Ronald Bruehlman: Question was about the mix shift in margins between FSP and full service, correct?
Tejas Savant: That's right.
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. Look, FSP tends to be somewhat lower margin than full service. Now, take into account, though, that full service comes with pass-through -- significant pass-through revenues that FSP doesn't. And so when you look at the average margins, including passers, they're not that different. But yes, in general, there has been -- there is some margin degradation as a result of the shift towards FSP. On the other hand, this shift is a very gradual shift that's going on. It's -- you're talking about points of single points of shift, not huge -- a huge flight to FSP, and it takes place over time, remember, the average trial for plus years to complete. So there really hasn't been any dramatic impact on our margins as a result of that. And, of course, we're working all the time to optimize and take costs out and do things to improve our margins independent of whatever contracts we happen to be signing. So I would say, not a big impact there. And you see in our EBITDA margins, they've actually continue to improve overall and that's with R&DS being over 50% of our revenue.
Ari Bousbib: And then your second question?
Tejas Savant: Yes. My second question, actually, I'm going to switch to the TAS comments, guys. I mean, are you encouraging to see expectations of a recovery in the back half of the year? And you talked about your detailed bottom-up pipeline build there. But I just want to put a finer point on it in terms of just the timing of the recovery, right? So, what gives you confidence comes through in 2H 2024 versus getting pushed to 2025? Is it something related to contracted work that you have clear line of sight to versus work that could be delayed? Or is it some large real-world evidence projects that you see coming through here in the back half?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Tejas. No, it's not anything -- any one contract or a specific level, as I mentioned, the overall sentiment bubbling up into a pipeline that I mentioned is the highest that we've had ever. Now, the pipeline doesn't always translate exactly as it is. It's probability adjusted and so on and so forth, but that's a good indication from a metric standpoint that we should be up for the year. And we've built some level of cushion here because we've been burned/delayed last year. And so that's what kind of gives us a little bit of confidence along with the conversations we're having with our clients. Again, I wouldn't -- this is not like -- we're not seeing a sharp uptick all of a sudden, okay? Our clients are -- especially large pharma, very, very focused on cost containment. They've all announced significant cost reduction programs. Some of them in anticipation of really unknown impact of the IRA, some in anticipation of some LOEs coming soon in the next few years or other variables, but the fact is there are these large pharma cost discussions that we're having with clients as well, and we are a significant vendor and therefore, those conversations have tended to be more difficult than they were in the past with respect to negotiations and pricing and so on. That is still there. The number of opportunities, the number of projects, the number of compensations, all of which translate into a pipeline, the request for proposals and so on that we're having are clearly up. And given the life cycle of the sales processes as we know them, we are anticipating that those would concretize into sales towards the back end of the year.
Ronald Bruehlman: And Tejas, just one point of emphasis here, too. In the TAS business particularly is hundreds and hundreds of projects. You're not going to have any individual project move the needle there. Thank you.
Tejas Savant: Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott from Barclays. Your line is open.
Luke Sergott: Hi, guys. Can you talk about the -- we keep talking about the TAS recovery, but -- and the big pipeline that you guys have, but can you kind of double-click into what that looks like versus discretionary versus the sticky side? I think there's a lot of confusion about where the weakness has been in TAS and where the strength has been? And if there's actually any change or improvement on the side of like regulatory and medical writing, things like that to give more confidence in that back half recovery that you're talking about?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, look, we ourselves are, as I mentioned before, I'm putting a fair amount of caution and conservatism, if you want to call it that way in our own forecast because of some of the factors you mentioned, that we've experienced last year. The business continues to grow. Look, the general environment so far is consistent with what we were experiencing at the end of last year. And you've seen our large cap companies that operate in the same business actually forecast even declining sales for their own businesses for 2024. Now, we're not there because as you correctly point out, some of these services that we sell are not exactly discretionary, so look, the data business, for example, continues to hold up well. It's never been a fast growth business, but it's holding up. We saw headwinds in the more discretionary part of the TAS segment, which is the analytics and consulting business. But I have to say that the business started to pick up a bit with sequential improvements in growth in Q4 compared to Q3. So even this more discretionary side, we saw an uptick, not -- again, not a steep curve, but we saw a positive movement even on the discretionary side. Now, the impact on the discretionary project part of the real-world business, that is a little bit of a longer cycle within TAS, is a little bit longer cycle. We started seeing that in Q3 and continued in Q4, and it did impact the performance of our real-world business in Q4. So, if I might summarize the data business holding up maybe a little bit even better, doing a little bit better. The totally discretionary piece of analytics and consulting, little movement and some uptick that we are perceiving. The real-world piece, you've got the stuff that they need to do. That hasn't changed. And then there is a step that's more discretionary because it's more -- it's a longer cycle, the deceleration impacted our numbers more in Q3 and further in Q4. So, the issues we saw in Analytics and Consulting in the early part of the year, we started seeing in real world in Q3 and Q4, and we expect that to continue in Q1. But if you -- I hope that gives you enough color here to get a sense for what we're seeing.
Luke Sergott: It does, it does. Thank you. And then I guess a follow-up on the -- there's a lot of concern here. Some of your peers talked about biotech RFP slowing in 4Q. But just as you look at the actual step-up needed to maintain the book-to-bills and the bookings levels that you guys have had. Do you see that, that level of RFP volume across all your segments is enough to sustain it over the next six months? Or could we see some softening here maybe in the 1Q? And obviously, this is just more of a quarterly dynamic as the full year kind of paces out as what you're talking about. But just when you're thinking about the actual bookings getting -- you're closing that sales cycle, could some stuff get pushed out to more of the back half of the year. 
Ari Bousbib: I mean, look, you've got a lot of hypothetical here. You're referring to a competitor commentary. I didn't hear any of that. And we're not seeing that again. This is interesting. People want to see badness and had their hat on something. I would point to you that going back a couple of years at least, people who are competitors "whining about EVP funding." and all see our stock suffered as a result of this whining, we kept telling the world that we weren't seeing it. We ended up being correct. There was no dramatic drop-off in funding. It didn't happen. If anything, now, as I mentioned, it's even going further at record levels. So EVP is good. That actually was very, very strong in terms of bookings. We see that trend continuing. When things get funded in a quarter, typically the bookings come in over the course of the following year. So, I don't see that happening on the EBP segment. Large pharma, yes, there is a little bit of reprioritization of projects. You've heard that from us, from others, looking at different programs, but it's not like people are saying, all of a sudden, we're not doing research anymore. There's a little bit of -- at the moment, as we discussed earlier Ron mentioned a bit of a pendulum moving more towards FSP. But again, we play in that segment, too. We play in every segment. But other than these dynamics, I don't see anything that would lead me to believe that all of a sudden, we have to be worried, quite the opposite. As I said, our RFP flow was up 13% in Q4, and that's across the board, strong double-digits in EBP and in large pharma as well. For the -- that was in Q4. Full year same thing, very strong and EBP even stronger for the full year. Awards, which is sort of, if you will, a leading indicator of bookings because as you know, we and maybe a small number of others actually report bookings and book to risk based on contracted work. Some still report only awards, which is kind of before contracted and awards are also at a record high level. If you look at our pipeline, the total pipeline is up high single-digits, in very high single-digits, again, at a record level. Qualified pipeline, which is we look at -- we have our own methodology to screen all the opportunities and come down to those that we think are the ones we want to pursue and that are the most viable and the most likely to come to fruition. The qualified pipeline is up strong double-digits, again, across the board. So, I don't know what else to tell you. I don't -- you heard anything that I don't know, let me know.
Luke Sergott: No, that's why I'm in my seat and you're in your seat. Appreciate. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the color on the complexity of the demand environment. I had a question about the 4Q bookings. Can you comment on sort of what percentage was FSP? I know you said it, obviously, with the revenue shift is very incremental over the course of the year. But I would just be curious, sort of, level set what you're seeing in the current environment there?
Ari Bousbib: The question is how much of our bookings was FSP. I think a little over 20%, is that correct?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes, -- was the bookings in the quarter and that's for the full year for FSP.
Ari Bousbib: How much -- can you be more -- well, how much was EVP? 25%?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. Total EVP is about one-quarter of our bookings for the year. 
Ari Bousbib: Right. And I think FSP is mostly large pharma, right?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes.
Elizabeth Anderson: And then how would you comment on the rate card as we think about 2024 in terms of both full service work and FSP?
Ronald Bruehlman: Talk about pricing?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. No, no, rate card, the rates, labor and so on.
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. I mean, look, this continues to be pressure from clients and negotiate and tough negotiations that's been the biggest surprise for me over the past several years, and that is that you got a better mode, you've got a better company, a better delivery system, better capabilities, then we should be able to actually charge more. But lo and behold, we've got competitors. And as I said before, clients are -- clients that we want to continue to have. We have with whom we sell a lot to we sell a lot of stuff. And we have strong relationships. And when the client tells you, listen, CEO calls you and says, I need you to lower the rate here on this because it's going to help me in my cost reduction program, it's hard to say, listen, I'm better than a competitor and the answer is no. So we don't say yes to everything, but this is part of managing our long-term relationships, and we -- I wouldn’t hide the fact that we are having maybe more pressure than we had before, generally on pricing that's across the board. There's no secret there.
Elizabeth Anderson: Got it. That’s super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A little bit of a follow-up to Elizabeth there. Ari, we spent in December, quite a bit of time talking about the decision cycle environment with, I think, principally large pharma. So I joined late, but I've heard you describe that your RFP flows look pretty good. Your awards look pretty good. Those things seem to be holding up, but you had described that whether it was IRA or pending loss of exclusivity of important products or whatever that clients were kind of mulling over their prioritizations and processes a lot longer than normal. And I suppose part of that is probably also a little bit of Elizabeth -- your answer to Elizabeth's question around pricing and trying to meet budget cut targets and things like that. How would you -- I'd love for you to elaborate on that environment? And do you feel like you're closer to the end of it? Or are we still in the middle of it? When do we think large pharma will be back the business, so to speak?
Ari Bousbib: Well, again, I want to make sure -- I mean, it's not like back to business, not like people are on hold and they are not doing anything again. I mean, look, our backlog continues to grow. The RFP flow is up double-digits.
Nicholas Childs: Second highest bookings quarter ever.
Ari Bousbib: Right. We had the second highest bookings quarter ever and the first -- the one that was the highest, which was last year, I think that was -- we had a very big proportion of pass-through from specific large award. That's why it was like over $3 billion, if I recall, in that quarter. So, this quarter, we had, what, $2.8 billion. I mean -- and that was like a regular quarter with nothing unusual, no big one-timer award or anything like that. So, it's a pretty -- the numbers are the numbers. Now, the conversations are more difficult, longer, more negotiations, but the volume -- the answer to your question is I think the volume and the number of opportunities, it keeps going up. And again, EBP funding very strong, all-time high. We saw particular strength on EBP, and we see that continuing this year. So not like we're on hold and thinking about when are we back to business. That's perhaps a question we were asking ourselves on the TAS segment, and that we are in the middle of, and we see some sign of green shoots as Elizabeth told us before, or Anne, I think, was the one used that expression, some green shoots on the commercial side to the back end of the year. But on the R&DS side, we are experiencing the pressure, the more difficult environment with respect to pricing and negotiation and so on. We are in those conversations. But no one is saying, I'm going to hold, and I'm not doing anything. Again, the numbers showed numbers of RFPs, the pipeline at an all-time high, the qualified pipeline up strong double-digits and are going across the board. It's not like there's one segment or another. So I would say quite the opposite. I think the number of opportunities, the environment is very fertile in terms of chasing opportunities and responding to request for proposals, we are very, very busy.
David Windley: Okay. So if I could follow up then. To go the next step and ask perhaps what might be the factors that are influencing the disconnect between a high single-digit to double-digit RFP award pace with a below mid-single-digit revenue growth. So I understand part of that is TAS, I'm going to try to head off a little bit in the past. Part of that is TAS. I know that. So, we'll set that aside. And I know you also attribute some to COVID, but COVID is now small enough that it is like any other big project that you would see come to a conclusion in any given year and ramp transition those people to a new project and ramp that up. So, it would seem that you're to a point where the backlog growth should be translating to R&DS revenue growth, and there's a disconnect there. So to what would you attribute that? 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So again, if you take R&DS, it's not -- COVID, it's not like one project like any other. It's not the case. We really have a COVID is very specific. It took specific resources, it's specific projects. And in 2024, it's coming down by $300 million. That represents a direct headwind to growth of 350 basis points to R&DS growth, 350 basis points. In addition, and this is more of a mix issue I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a number of wins, and we continue to win in the oncology area. We're happy about that because that's the fastest-growing therapeutic area, hands down all around. It has been for a while and will continue to be. And we are winning in oncology. The issue with that therapeutic area is that the burn rate is much lower. It takes time. It's more difficult to recruit patients. It's more complex. And therefore, it transfers into revenue slower than anything else. And we have a disproportionate share in that market. Third reason in the mix, we do have -- we happen to be, and that's just a consequence. It's hard to explain, but some years, we've got tailwinds from pass-throughs and some years, we have headwind from pass-throughs. As you know, pass-throughs are -- I'm not going to say irrelevant, but they come with no profit. They come with -- it's just an artificial accounting add to our -- but the fact our buildup forecast for 2024, pass-throughs will be a headwind to R&DS growth, and that represents 100 basis points approximately of headwind to top line growth of R&DS, again, inclusive of pass-throughs. So, if you add 350 basis points of headwind from COVID from the step down in COVID and 100 basis points of headwind from the pass-through mix, that's 450 basis points. So, you're right. But if you add back this and you normalize our underlying business is growing high single-digits, very high single-digits on the R&DS side. So, I think that's the reconciliation. You're right, Dave, you're smart analysts and you point to the apparent disconnect between the strong growth of our bookings and the reported growth in 2024, which, again, we hope to be out of that in 2025. It certainly bodes well. 2025 should be a sweet year. I don't want to put actions for 2025 here. We're barely talking about 2024. But I think based on everything we're seeing, we should certainly be behind all of those issues. But thank you Dave, I think that was the last question. Thank you.
David Windley: Thank you.
Operator: This ends our question-and-answer session. Mr. Childs, I turn the call back over to you.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our first quarter earnings call in April. The team and I will be available the rest of the day to answer any follow-up questions you have. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations.  Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.  The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. So in line with our expectations, R&DS is performing very well. The TAS business continued to grow, but revenue fell short of what we had expected. About half of our total revenue shortfall came from foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous guidance, and the other half from persistent weakness in demand in the TAS segment. Despite the TAS revenue shortfall, our productivity actions allowed us to deliver on our profit guidance. We continue to receive questions about the health of the industry and customer demand. And I'd like to give you the latest of what we are seeing in the market.  Let's start on the clinical development side. Demand in the R&DS segment remains strong. Net new bookings exceeded $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.24x overall, including pass-throughs. And given that this quarter, there is a significant difference between services bookings and bookings with pass-through, I note that our services bookings were the highest ever at $2.3 billion, resulting in a 1.4x services book-to-bill.  Our backlog reached $28.8 billion, growing 11.7% versus prior year, another historic high. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 10% year-over-year with growth across all customer segments. Our strong performance is supported by continued healthy market dynamics. Emerging biotech funding was strong in the quarter. According to BioWorld, third quarter EVP funding was $18.7 billion, the largest quarter this year. Year-to-date, EVP funding through Q3 was up 8% versus prior year.  If you look at the first half, large pharma R&D spend, it was above 20% of net revenues, highlighting continued strong R&D activity within large pharma as well. Based on these indicators, the clinical trial industry remains healthy. Our strong market position, market wins, scale and differentiated offerings give us confidence that our R&DS business will continue to deliver above-market growth.  Turning now to TAS. On the commercial side of our business, we are obviously facing a tougher macro environment. Our clients remain cautious with their spending and have extended their decision-making time lines beyond what we would have normally expected. I'm sure you also saw that several large pharma have announced significant cost reduction programs. And obviously, we are a significant vendor to large pharma.  Now we had anticipated to see improvements as we progress through the year, specifically in the quarter, we usually see activity pick up in September after the slower July, August summer months. It didn't happen. While we still have growth for the segment as a whole, we experienced further declines in our Analytics and Consulting business somewhat slower-than-expected growth in the discretionary parts of our real-world business as well as some impact from the China situation.  While the acceleration we are anticipating is taking longer than expected, based on our pipeline, we remain confident that there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. We know this because the pipeline of opportunities remain strong even as decision time lines are elongated, and negotiations with our customers have become more difficult. We also know this because historically, going back 25 years, every time there was a pullback in spend on the commercial side. The industry adapts and comes back within a year or two.  With this as context, let's now review the third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter grew 4.9% on a reported basis, 4.1% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 8.5% on a constant currency basis, and that includes approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline.  Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.49 faced the ongoing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the U.K. corporate tax rate. If you exclude the impact of these nonoperational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth underlying was 13%. Let me share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter.  And let me start with TAS. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded several noteworthy analytics contracts to support our clients' go-to-market strategies. For example, an EBP clients selected IQVIA to provide analytics around key prescriber and payer trends for their women's health products. In another significant win this quarter, IQVIA secured a large U.S. data analytics contract with a top 10 pharma client that has been buying from a competitor for over a decade. We also received an award from an EBP client to support the launch of their first branded product into the diabetes market.  This will be an end-to-end launch solution, including field reps, inside sales reps, OCE, information management infrastructure, data analytics, commercial compliance and co-pay card operations. Also in the quarter, I'm sure you saw that we received an award from Sanofi to deploy our OCE platform within the Middle East and Africa markets. Sanofi has been using IQVIA in many markets around the world to support the HCP engagement.  On the tech side, we've been getting some questions about our partnership with Salesforce. And I just want to confirm that IQVIA has been a key life sciences partner to Salesforce for many years now with offerings that span from clinical to commercial. And we plan to continue this strong partnership with Salesforce, combining our life sciences domain expertise and intelligence with sales force technologies and platforms.  Moving now to Real-World. We were awarded multiple rare disease studies from both large pharma and biotech clients, highlighting our expertise and differentiated offerings within this growing therapeutic area including innovative study design, patient recruitment and AI-enabled technology to provide unique solutions. A couple of examples. The top 20 large pharma awarded IQVIA a 10-year study to improve patient treatment for a rare genetic liver disease. The Japanese EVP client awarded IQVIA 2 large post-marketing surveillance studies on rare diseases in the circulatory nervous and muscular systems.  Moving now to R&DS. We entered into a strategic collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, aimed at enhancing the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases. This collaboration is a key enabler of CEPI's mission goal, which is sponsored by the G7 and G20 countries to develop safe, effective and globally accessible vaccines against emerging disease outbreaks within 100 days.  We've also entered into an innovative strategic collaboration with Argenx, a global immunology biotech company leveraging our connected intelligence capabilities we bring together end-to-end asset development services, ranging from regulatory to market authorization to integrated technology-enabled pharmacovigilance safety tracking. This will allow Argenx to accelerate the market launch of new rare disease therapies to autoimmune patients.  In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client renewed the FSP partnership with IQVIA as they look to design and launch their new clinical monitoring model. IQVIA will codevelop the solution leveraging our expertise, innovative tech-enabled approach and exceptional delivery performance. IQVIA has remained the sole global medical information center provider by one of our large pharma clients. IQVIA differentiates in the market as the only provider to have successfully utilized an AI, natural language processing solution for medical information.  As has been the case in the last few years, R&DS continues to win big in oncology with multiple awards in the quarter, a few examples. IQVIA won a late-stage program with a biotech company developing immuno-oncology therapies, we were selected after successful delivery of an earlier stage trial as well as our unparalleled data analytics to help identify patients and populations with unmet needs. We were awarded a Phase III oncology trial from a large cutting-edge biotech company. IQVIA was selected for our expertise in endometrial carcinoma cancer as well as our ability to accelerate trial start-up. This is an important trial, given the unmet medical need and limited treatment options for patients with this condition.  Also, IQVIA was awarded 2 large global oncology trials from a midsized pharma client. IQVIA was selected due to our strategic design and operational expertise in oncology including our ability to manage multiple large complex trials and our experience in managing the unique safety profile of these molecules.  With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ronald Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3,736 million grew 4.9% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. Now in the quarter, COVID-related revenues were about $95 million, down about $125 million versus the third quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 8.5%. As Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth.  Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,431 million, that's up 2.2% on a reported basis and 0.9% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 5%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,122 million was up 7.2% reported and 6.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 11%.  Lastly, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $183 million was flat on a reported basis and up 4.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue of $11,116 million grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth was 11% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4,331 million, up 2% reported and 2.4% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS year-to-date was 7%.  R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6,244 million was up 6.5% at actual FX rates and 6.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and R&DS was 14% year-to-date. And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million declined 3.6% reported and increased 1.2% at constant currency.  Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $888 million, representing growth of 9.1%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,603 million, up 7.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $303 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $889 million or $4.76 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $462 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.49. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1,378 million, or $7.37 per diluted share. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% in the third quarter and 12% year-to-date. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Backlog at September 30 stood at $28.8 billion, up almost 12% year-over-year and 33% higher in the last 3 years.  Yes, let's review the balance sheet. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,224 million and gross debt was $13,631 million and that resulted in net debt of $12,407 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.52x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $583 million and capital expenditures were $146 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $144 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity just slightly below $800 million. This leaves us with just under $2.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.  Yes. Let's turn to guidance. We're updating our guidance to reflect both the slower growth in the TAS segment and the headwind from foreign exchange rates compared to our previous guide, we currently expect revenue to be between $14,885 million and $14,920 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.3% to 3.5%. Excluding approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022, this guidance represents growth at constant currency of approximately 9%, including about 140 basis points of contribution from acquisitions.  To reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3,560 million to $3,570 million, and this represents year-over-year growth of 6.4% to 6.7%. It also implies 70 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.16 to $10.23, which is flat to up 0.7% versus the prior year. This includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in U.K. corporate tax rate. If you were to exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 12%.  But based on this full year outlook, our implied fourth quarter guidance is as follows. For revenue, we expect between $3,769 million and $3,804 million or growth of 0.8% to 1.7% on a reported basis and 0.7% to 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $957 million and $967 million, up 4% to 5.1%. Net yield margin expansion of about 80 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.79 and $2.86, growing 0.4% to 2.9% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we're expecting fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS to grow 10% to 13%.  Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30 continue for the balance of the year. Now as is our custom, we plan to provide you with a detailed 2024 full year guidance on our Q4 earnings call in February. However, while it's early, and we're still in the midst of our planning process, we thought it would be helpful to share a preliminary view that would help you frame how we see 2024. We see reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2024. This includes a further step down of approximately $300 million in covered revenue, which is about 200 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. As well as another 100 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange rates, assuming current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect of 2024. We see adjusted EBITDA margins expanding 50 basis points, and this will drive high single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth.  Now, I trust this preliminary look at 2024 is helpful to you. Again, we will, as is our custom, give you more detailed guidance and specificity for 2024 when we release our full year earnings early next year. So to summarize, despite client caution and spending levels below our expectations, the TAS business continued its growth in the quarter. While the near-term growth outlook for TAS is below our previous expectations, we're confident in the longer-term fundamentals of the business as our pipelines indicate there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. In the quarter, we delivered another strong performance in R&DS with 11% revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, quarterly net new bookings were strong at over $2.6 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 1.24x, and we reached a historic high of $2.3 billion in services bookings representing a services book-to-bill of 1.4x out.  Our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.8 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year. And finally, leading indicators on the clinical side remains strong as evidenced by our quarterly RFP growth of 10% versus the prior year, with growth across all customer segments.  With that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the conference for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: One thing that I was just trying to work through for my own sort of benefit is sort of the commentary, I think, Ari, you alluded to in terms of some of the pullback in R&D spend on the pharma side. And the sort of continued strength of R&DS in terms of bookings and what you're seeing in terms of RFPs. Could you help us sort of think about how you think about those 2 factors sort of that commentary where you sort of think pharma's growth is going to be sort of the remainder of this year and next year? And that -- and maybe remind us of how that's played out in prior cycles?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. You're asking -- Elizabeth, thanks for your question. You're asking about contrasting the pullback in spend on the commercial side versus continued strength in R&DS.
Elizabeth Anderson: Sorry, R&DS, more specifically, sorry?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. But there is no pull back on spend in R&DS. I don't think I said that. I said the opposite. Funding in R&DS has been very strong. I'm sorry if I misspoke -- was misunderstood, but there is no pullback in R&DS quite the opposite. I mentioned in my introductory comments that the -- if you look at the EBP sector, which has been under pressure and people have been concerned about, we see EBP funding in the quarter actually higher than it was last year.  And I think year-to-date, I mentioned that funding was up 8% year-over-year. So I also mentioned that we are experiencing a strong continued RFP flow growth. It's actually up 10% in the quarter year-over-year. So I think it's quite the opposite. Our world continue at a record high level, again, higher than last year. To give you some more color, our qualified pipeline is up 16% year-over-year and continues to be very, very strong. Our total pipeline as well, very strong, record high historically. I mentioned our book-to-bill in the quarter is 1.24x and basis, including pass-throughs, and when you exclude pass-throughs and you just focus on services, our book-to-bill is 1.4x. Our services bookings were $2.3 billion in the quarter. That's a historic high for us. So again, nothing that we see and we've been handling this point over and over again in the environment or in an all internal metric leads us to believe there is anything changed on the R&DS spend.  There are different dynamics. It is true that we have -- we see our clients, large pharma, especially explore new models with more FSP or hybrid type of services awarded. I mentioned we won some large FSPs, which explains, of course, the lower amount of pass-throughs in the quarter in our bookings. But other than that, the spend is strong and our prospects for the business continue to be very strong on the R&DS side.
Elizabeth Anderson: Ari, that's super helpful. And so when we take the sort of pharma R&D commentary that you said about some of the pullbacks that -- and some of the spending cuts in there, you would say that you guys are seeing -- you're still seeing strong demand within that specific pharma segment, maybe yes, further and they're cutting costs by pushing more into FSP and maybe there's some anecdotal large pharma companies that are cutting with the sort of broader strength across that. That's the correct way to interpret what you're saying on the large pharma?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean -- large pharma, you saw, I think 2/3 of the top 10 large pharma and we know that, that's basically the case. The vast majority of large pharma companies have announced either publicly or internally a significant cost-cutting program, that's due to the macro environment, which is very challenging. Concerns raised by the IRA and the general issues that we see geopolitical problems all over the world, continuing wars in Europe, the Middle East. And of course, we have the situation in China which has all but frozen the market for multinational corporations in China.  So all of those are headwinds plus the companies that were very active during the COVID years are seeing dramatic pullbacks in revenue and all of that is putting pressure on margins. And as a result, large pharma has been -- and I would say, unusually so, very aggressive in launching cost reduction programs. Now I said before that, that is not reflected. So far, we haven't seen that in the R&D side of the house. Again, I want to reiterate very strong strength. I mean a good momentum in the business and all the metrics show that there is no slowdown there.  Again, not surprising. It's a long-cycle business. However, we're bearing the brunt of those cost reduction initiatives on the TAS segment where we see that projects that should take a certain amount of time are taking a lot more time to get decided or awarded. And we see our clients negotiating on terms a lot harder than they ever were. And all of that has caused us to come short on the TAS segment in our revenues. But again, we're confident that this is will rebound. We know this because the pipelines continue to be very strong on the TAS segment.  And we -- if you look back at every time there was a pullback of source from large pharma in history, whether you go back to the 2008, '10 period or anytime some big legislation was enacted. There was always a little bit of a pullback. And then it came back, the company -- the industry is very innovative and comes back growing and our business goes along with it. So we're confident that we'll come back sometime in '24. Thank you, Elizabeth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Just wanted to follow up on the TAS segment here. You talked about sort of longer time lines. But when you're in discussions with clients, do they continue to express an intention to kind of continue with the projects? Or are they sort of just on hold? And how much of this is -- you mentioned the IRA. How much would you attribute to sort of the pharma companies kind of reviewing pipelines and projects overall? And do you have a sense of how long that kind of process could take? You mentioned sort of reacceleration sometime in '24, but is -- do you think that's early next year? Or could that stretch into later next year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, thank you, Charles. I mean, look, I want to distinguish again between the clinical development side of the house and the commercial shorter cycle part of the house where there are more pockets of spend that are more discretionary from a time line standpoint. So again, on the clinical side of the house, yes, there are reviews of pipelines and so on and which molecules are worthwhile developing, there's more analysis.  But this is at the early, early stage of the process. As you know, we are primarily almost entirely a Phase III clinical trial company. And so we are not seeing that, and we will not be seeing that for another several years, if it were to affect the pipeline. I remind you that the number of molecules coming down the pipe is at a record high. The number of FDA approval is at a record high. And all of that bodes well for our clinical business and all the metrics that we see from funding to RFPs, to awards, to backlog and bookings are very, very strong.  Once again, we had a record historically -- historic high in services bookings in the quarter of $2.3 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x, excluding pass-through. So that's what the clinical side of the house. We have not seen the impact of any revisions or rethinking of pipelines so far. On the commercial side, that's the area where we are seeing an impact of our clients being more cautious, more conservative, stepping back from some of the projects they were planning to do. But for the most part, what we do, except again for the discretionary part, must be done, there is discretion with respect to timing. And of course, clients are being more aggressive in terms of seeking price reductions and better terms and so on.  The pipelines that we have indicate that demand is still there. To your question, when people say to us, they will no longer do a project, it's no longer in our pipeline. But if it remains in our pipeline, then it means the clients still intends to do it. It's just that the time line for decision-making has been pushed to the right. What explains it, it's, again, general concerns about the economy, general concerns about the macro geopolitical issues, the pressures resulting from sharp revenue declines, post-COVID and what that entails from a margin point of view.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we are a very large vendor to pharma and to large pharma in particular. And when large pharma seeks to improve their margins, they seek to reduce costs. And obviously, they come to us for further reductions and that elongates time lines, and of course, erodes pricing as well on our side. All of that has resulted in us coming short on our revenues in TAS, along with, as we mentioned in the introductory remarks, the significant FX headwinds versus what we had guided to before. So that's the environment. Thank you for that question.
Charles Rhyee: Sorry, and the portfolio review?
Ari Bousbib: Portfolio on the R&D side?
Charles Rhyee: No, no. On the commercialization side, I misspoke. I meant, how much has the IRA impact is sort of as a -- has that had an effect on when pharmas have portfolio reviews and where they put their discretionary spend, but it sounds like you're saying it's more just the general macro environment that's had an impact on?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. We measure the IRA hasn't had any concrete -- significant concrete impact yet on the market. This is all based on hypothetical developments and down the line. So that just adds another cloud of uncertainty and in anticipation of that uncertainty that causes management teams to appropriately seek cost containment. That's all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS.
Daniel Leonard: I just wanted to circle back to your 2024 framing commentary, that mid-single-digit growth figure. Can you speak to your expectations between the TAS segment in the R&DS segment? And then in R&DS in 2024, do you expect any meaningful difference in growth rates between the direct fee revenue and total revenue?
Ari Bousbib: So again, this is a very -- we thought it would be helpful just because there's uncertainty. And you will recall that even in the -- at the peak of COVID, we decided to give you guidance early. And we're doing this because we hope that, that's helpful to you. Now it's an initial outlook based on where we are in our planning process. We have not completed that planning process. So I would caution you that this is, again, preliminary, and we will come back as is our custom when we release full year earnings early in '24 with detailed and precise guidance by segments, et cetera.  Just on your question, we are guiding to mid-single digit overall revenue growth. That includes $300 million of step-down from COVID and I think that's essentially are in R&DS. So if you added that back to our total revenues, that would be another couple of hundred basis points on top of that. And of course, we have -- we expect 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds assuming FX rate remains where they are today.  So when we say mid-single digits, that's really on a reported basis once you adjust for the COVID step-down and FX, it's more high single digits, which I'm sure you agree for and about $15 billion revenue company is quite an achievement in the current environment. With respect to segment growth, I think it's too early to give it to you. We obviously have an idea, but what should we -- I mean, I just gave it to you when we tell you that the COVID impact is 100% in R&DS, you could just assume that we are expecting -- is actually for now, assume about the same across the segments, that is mid-single digits, I would say, okay, before the COVID adjustment.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question will come from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.
David Windley: Ari, I wanted to focus on margin. You commented in your prepared remarks about productivity initiatives that you took in the third quarter, you're talking about the bookings mix being heavy to service, and so that could be beneficial in R&DS to EBITDA growth. Just wondered if you could talk expansively about any further productivity initiatives that you might be able to take? And kind of what are the drivers to get you to that 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion for next year?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, David. Look, I mean, the productivity initiatives I mentioned, not just in the third quarter, you will recall, we started this towards the end of last year. That's what has led us to be able to address the revenue shortfall and not completely bear the brunt of that reduction falling through EBITDA. We've been able to offset a lot of that headwind with those cost reduction programs. It takes time.  As you know, if we -- the actions that we took in Q3 are not going to be benefit in Q4, Q1, Q2 of next year. So we're possibly taking actions to restructure our overhead structure, to review our spans of control globally, to continue our offshoring programs to review our infrastructure footprint that includes real estate. It includes IT. It includes really all of that infrastructure that we need to run our business and all of those cost factors along with mix of the -- the proper mix of in-sourcing, outsourcing.  And as I mentioned, continued offshoring of certain activities and taking advantage of labor arbitrage among our different centers, whether it's in the Philippines, in India, in Bangladesh, in South America, et cetera, all of those things are being done on an ongoing basis, and we see the benefit in our margins this year. And the actions we took, for example, in the third quarter, the carryover benefit will materialize in Q4. So the -- and in following quarters during 2024. The reason we feel confident about a 50 basis point margin expansion in 2024 is because we see that it's the carryover of the actions we took this year that will benefit on a full year basis 2024. And of course, we don't intend to stop those actions selectively.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: So I just wanted to take a step back and with respect to some of the cost-cutting programs that we've seen large pharma announced, what is IQVIA's opportunity to sort of participate in some of that and help drive some of those savings, whether it's in sort of R&DS or TAS? And then secondarily, on -- for the outlook for 2024, what's the M&A assumption embedded in that growth rate?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Justin, for your question. Yes, we are actively engaged with our customers to help them with their cost reduction programs. Look, we have to, we are a large vendor to large pharma across the board, clinical and TAS. And they come to us and ask us to help them. So we have an opportunity to do that. Obviously, it affects our revenue growth, that's primarily the case in TAS because that's where the pricing changes and the renegotiated terms impact us almost immediately, less so in R&DS, but mostly in TAS.  Now the opportunities, if you will, for us, is that in those conversations, we try to offer more services, that has always been the case. That's a traditional way of engaging with our clients when they seek our cost reductions. We try to capture a bigger share of their spend in exchange for being able to deliver those services at a lower price point. And so the benefit for us is longer term, we get a bigger piece as they give us more volume. We've seen that happen, frankly, on the commercial side and on the R&DS side, over the past 5, 6 years and certainly since the merger. And we certainly hope that, that will materialize, but it will take a couple of years to materialize because when clients need to switch vendors, it takes time to let the contract and convey them to us. Your next question was on the...
Justin Bowers: Acquisition impact.
Ari Bousbib: It's about -- yes, about 100 basis points, yes. Again, that's the assumption for 2024 at this stage. Yes. That's what's baked in -- when we come back we'll give you formal guidance. This is really not guidance. It's really a preliminary look on where we are. Thank you, Justin.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I just want to drill down a little bit more into TAS. You talked about the discretionary areas. Maybe you can just get a little bit more into -- is it consulting, BPO, software data sales? Maybe just a little bit more of detail as to how growth is trending within each one of kind of the subsegments. I know you don't break it out exactly revenue-wise, but it is helpful to kind of think about what's going on beneath the surface there?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo, for the question and -- but you need to clarify. Look, the TAS segment has continued to grow in the quarter. I mean, you know and you can look at the large cap companies that serve the life sciences industry with products and services, supporting post-drug introduction in the market and you can see that they almost uniformly are showing declining growth this year, and sharp declines in the quarter for those who have reported.  Now we continue to have growth. And the reason for that is because some of this stuff is longer term and is somewhat mission-critical. I'm speaking about data, the stuff that's technology licenses, subscription, recurring revenue, all of that continues as is, and that's what is enabling us to continue to deliver growth. However, the parts of our business that are more discretionary. And when I say discretionary, I don't mean to say that our clients may decide simply not to go ahead. It happens, but that's a small proportion of what we sell. It means that it can be done later. It means that it can be done in a different way, perhaps in a "slim-down version", less -- better than we thought.  And so the consulting and analytics part of our business, which as you know is a bad quarter of our revenues. It is showing sharp declines, sharper than we would have expected. Some of the projects have simply fallen off, but the pipelines are still there. That's what gives us confidence for a rebound in '24. We know that these projects have to be done. The clients are just taking a lot more time to make a decision. They are negotiating us a lot longer and a lot more aggressively. And this is what has happened.  This is -- I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a few examples of significant wins in TAS, and these are almost uniformly these types of projects. Helping clients launch a -- launch products in new markets, helping them with their go-to-market strategies. These are things that have to be done. And the project that we won in the quarter, frankly, some of those we should have won in the first quarter. They were in the pipeline since last year. So the decision time lines have expanded and the terms have been tougher. That's what has happened. I hope that color helps you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: So you talked about the large FSP win. I know you're seeing a lot more shift to that type of hybrid model. And you've talked in the past about this being really in cyclical in nature. But this has also come at a lower margin. So help us think about like the duration, the size of the FSP wins that you had. And if we should expect some mix headwinds to your future over the next 3 months to a year on this business from -- regarding R&DS side.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Luke. Yes, you're absolutely correct that an FSP award comes at a lower booked margin than a full-service program. And you're also correct that this has -- is a cyclical development in the industry. I recall very well that at the time we did the merger 7 years ago, and coming into at the time, the legacy Quintiles organization, it was explained to me that the industry was now in the midst of a switch from full service to FSP. And as a result of which, Quintiles at the time had pulled back from servicing these clients because they didn't want to do FSP work given its lower margin profile.  I thought at the time there was a strategic error and we since then, of course, have decided to serve our clients with the full portfolio of services, including FSP and including full service and including hybrid and everything else. We serve clients. We don't push offerings. So if at this point in time, our clients are interested in more FSP or more hybrid models, that's what we will sell to them. It is then incumbent upon us to work on our cost structure to try to recover margins when we execute the work at a higher level than when we booked it out, and try to continue to develop cost containment and cost reductions so that we can offset the margin mix impact.  Look, we are a very large company we are executing thousands of trials at any given point in time. We manage a portfolio of businesses. Once again, we are about a $15 billion revenue company growing mid-single digits before your account for the step down in COVID revenue and the FX headwind. And we are at adjusted EBITDA margins of 24%, and we are expanding those margins. And we intend to continue that model well into the future despite cyclical headwinds that may occur, whether it is a tougher spending environment on the TAS side, whether it is a switch to FSP from some of our large pharma clients.  You saw in the quarter, again, $2.3 billion of services fee revenue, excluding pass-through bookings resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x, again, a historic high in our bookings. That included some FSP wins, again, not anything that would move the needle dramatically. But on a large number like this, you can see that we have less pass-throughs, that will materialize in our margin mix in the next couple of years, not next quarter, obviously, and we fully intend to offset that with our cost reductions and continue to increase our margins. Thank you for your question.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities.
Jailendra Singh: I want to ask about the capital deployment strategy over the next 12 months. Has there been any change there in terms of your priority to pay down debt versus buyback shares or even M&A allocation? And one quick clarification, what is the magnitude of the swaps rolling off next year?
Ari Bousbib: The first question and the second question, I'll give to the technicians here. The first question on capital allocation. Look, it's fascinating, we are getting from our investors 2 different messages. One is please, please reduce your leverage. And one is, please, please do not change your leverage. And I have to tell you, we historically have been living with a level of leverage that's admittedly higher than others. We are at around 3.5 net leverage right now. I want to just -- for the anecdote, tells you that we've had in the past, much higher levels of leverage and a much more difficult market conditions and much lower levels of cash flow conversion.  And we've lived with that nicely because we have a highly predictable, high-visibility business model. Our strategy has been, a, to invest in the business in capital expenditures, to innovate new products and services; b, by companies that add, that are accretive and enable us to grow faster; and, c, return money to our shareholders through share repurchases. And that has been a very effective strategy, especially when rates were extremely low.  I remind you that just 2 years ago, treasuries were at 0, 0. And I'm very glad that we had that amount of leverage. Today, treasury is at, what, 5.5? I mean we've never seen in history, such a sharp dramatic rise in interest rates in such a short period of time. Obviously, we are paying the brunt of our leverage, the price of that leverage because of that, and it's costing us 10 points, 10 points of growth in earnings per share.  However, I would argue that mid-single-digit treasury rates is high versus 0, but it's not the end of the world. I will also tell you that we though the brunt of that sharp increase in interest rates this year in '23. And assuming like everyone else assumes that the curve, if it needs to be believe indicates a stabilization and even a potential decline, then that should be a headwind -- I'm sorry, a tailwind to our EPS going forward, and we don't anticipate a sharp increase in rates or interest expense going forward.  And so therefore, we should be able to resume strong EPS growth going forward. That's for the leverage. Having said that, we are working as we speak on, obviously, refinancing and readdressing some of the shorter-term maturities, which we have in '24, in '25, and we'll do that soon, hopefully. And that will continue to alleviate that headwind that we faced this year in interest expense and continue to stabilize our balance sheet. But from there, at least, we intend to continue to use our cash to invest in the business and do acquisitions and share repurchase, especially at the levels where we are. Thank you for your question. Any comment on the swap?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes, we have about $800 million of swaps rolling off in the second quarter of 2024. Adding to that -- add anything to that, which is at about an average rate of about, call it, somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. So it will be a headwind next year, but not to the extent that you saw on the swap that rolled off this year.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you very much.
Nicholas Childs: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to everyone on our next call. And myself and the team will be available for any follow-up calls and any other follow-up questions you have across the day and over the next few days. So feel free to reach out. Thanks, everyone, for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And just as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin.
Nick Childs: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 9% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The demand environment for the industry continues to be healthy, which supports our confidence in the long-term outlook for our businesses. Emerging biotech funding continued its healthy trend. According to BioWorld, second quarter EBP funding was $17.1 billion, up 33% versus prior year and up 10% sequentially versus Q1. Clinical trial starts were up over 10% sequentially compared to Q1 2023. FDA approvals continued their strong momentum, which is a positive indicator for our commercial businesses going forward. There were 26 approvals in the first half of the year, and that's up 30% versus the average of the prior five years. M&A activity in the biopharma sector remains strong with over $90 billion spent in the first half. 2023 is on pace to be one of the largest years in the last decade in both value of transactions and number of deals, and that is with a high interest rate environment. Our Q2 demand metrics showed continued healthy growth. Net new bookings were just under $2.7 billion, which was our second largest quarter ever and represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. By the way, before I move on, I know that some of you inquired last quarter about our services book-to-bill, and I think some of you are concerned about what that may have implied about our performance. So just to remove any concern, our services book-to-bill this quarter was, Nick, 1.34?
Nick Childs: Correct.
Ari Bousbib: 1.34. And our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is 1.34 overall. And again, for those who asked, it's the same on a services basis. Once again, going forward, if there is any meaningful deviation between our total book-to-bill ratio and the services book-to-bill, then we will let you know. Otherwise, you can assume they are roughly the same. Now as a result of these bookings, our backlog reached $28.4 billion, growing 11% versus prior year on both reported and constant currency basis. Another metric we track is our quarterly RFP flow. And this past quarter, it was the largest ever. It was up 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. For the longer-term fundamentals of the industry are certainly very positive. Now in the short term, our clients have continued to be cautious with their spending due to the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and that's reflected primarily, I would say, only in some subsegments of our commercial business segments, that is TAS and CSMS. In the second quarter, these businesses were stable with the TAS segment growing in the second quarter at a rate consistent with the first quarter as we had anticipated in our guidance. Of course, last time we spoke, we expected client spending in these commercial businesses to show signs of acceleration by now. But unfortunately, they have continued to delay decisions. Our pipeline is still there. However, decisions keep being moved to the right. And as a result, we now expect these commercial businesses to perform for the balance of the year similarly to what we saw in the first half. For the TAS segment, that represents approximately 6% growth organically, excluding the impact of FX and the COVID step-down. And that 6% growth organically for the year is actually very strong in the current environment. With that, let's review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency compared to last year. And again, excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 9% at constant currency on an organic basis. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, driven by the revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.43, as expected, faced the headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate change. Excluding the impact of these non-operational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth would have been 14%. A few highlights of business activity. IQVIA has been awarded a significant contract with a top 10 pharma to implement our full commercial data and analytics solution suite. This suite of offerings will benefit our clients by utilizing insights powered by AI, such as personalized engagements with HCPs; leveraging our multichannel capabilities, including digital; precise geographical sales targeting; and better cost efficiency by reducing the number of resources that are manually generating insights. This initiative positions IQVIA as a strategic partner with this large top 10 pharma client for AI-powered data and analytics solutions. Another top 10 pharma extended and broadened an analytics project to track the sales performance of their top-selling immunotherapy oncology drug in Europe. The project allows commercial teams to continuously track brand performance, factoring AI-generated insights and improve, as a result, execution across seven cancer indications in over 25 countries. In another win, IQVIA was awarded a significant contract from another top 10 pharma client to deploy our OCE Optimizer application globally. This is an AI-powered multichannel sales management application that optimizes HCP engagement in real-time. IQVIA was selected over two other competitor solutions because of the seamless integration that OCE offers with the client's current ecosystem, the superior AI capability and our successful history with these clients in previous global system implementations. Also, in the quarter, IQVIA was selected by multiple clients to deliver regulatory-mandated plus post-approval safety studies in Europe. In each case, IQVIA was selected over preferred providers due to our deep expertise in sourcing data from the local health systems in Europe and our ability to bring multiple databases together in a harmonized manner for research. We were awarded a five-year pregnancy exposure study from an EBP customer to collect and analyze health information from women who take prescription medicines or vaccines during pregnancy and compare results with women who have not taken them. We won this award because of our rich experience in post-approval safety studies in pregnancy and deep experience in epidemiology. In the quarter, IQVIA has been recognized by the Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards with the prestigious Best AI-Based Solution for Healthcare award. IQVIA was recognized for its AI software, including natural language processing and proprietary large language models technology, which analyzes complex and unstructured patient data to provide unique insights into patient care and disease states. This technology is helping clinicians identify and screen at-risk patients, enabling targeted intervention to patients in need. IQVIA continues to differentiate in the application of AI analytics with two of the top 10 pharma companies designating their use of IQVIA AI as their innovation of the year. In addition, both Databricks and Snowflake separately named IQVIA their 2023 Health and Life Sciences Partner of the Year. These awards recognize AI and tech partners for their exceptional accomplishments and joint collaboration. There's a lot going on at IQVIA with generative AI, and we will likely be discussing this at the appropriate time at a future investor meeting. Let me now move to R&DS segment, which had another strong quarter, including several key wins. Our expertise in oncology continues to be a differentiator for us. In the quarter, a midsized pharma company awarded IQVIA two large Phase III trials for gastric and prostate cancer, which are expected to last about six years. The client selected IQVIA due to our therapeutic expertise and infrastructure to run global complex oncology studies as well as our global data assets. Also this quarter, a large FSP client renewed their partnership with IQVIA as a preferred provider this time without soliciting competing bids. This client was a historical lockout account for the historical Quintiles legacy company. We won here due to our FSP expertise, scale and delivery capabilities. In our lab business, the top 10 pharma awarded us a large study in the quarter for a novel drug that improves the quality of life of patients suffering from a serious autoimmune disease that impacts one out of 50 people worldwide. This study is our clients' top R&D program, and it has positioned IQVIA as the largest laboratory service provider for this client. Lastly, I'm proud to share that Sheetal Telang, Vice President of Therapeutic Strategy at IQVIA, has been honored with the 2023 Rising Star Award by the Healthcare Business Women's Association. Sheetal earned the award for strong and innovative leadership of critical industry initiatives, including by increasing diversity and inclusion levels among patients enrolled in clinical trials. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.728 billion grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-rebated revenues were approximately $120 million, which is down about $140 million versus the second quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID-rebated work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 9%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.456 billion. That was up 3.4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.096 billion was up 7.5% reported and 7.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 12%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, revenue of $176 million declined 3.8% reported and was flat at constant currency. Total company first half revenue was $7.380 billion, which was up 3.8% on a reported basis and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2.900 billion. That's up 1.9% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and TAS was 6% for the first half. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $4.122 billion was up 6.1% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14% in the first half. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first half revenue of $358 million declined 5.3% reported and 0.5% in constant currency. Let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $864 million for the second quarter, which represented growth of 8% while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.715 billion, which was up 6.4% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $297 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.59. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $586 million or $3.12 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $454 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.43. For the first half, adjusted net income was $916 million or $4.88 per share. Now, excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% in the second quarter and 11% for the first half. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another quarter of excellent bookings. Backlog at June 30 stood at a record $28.4 billion, which is up 11% year-over-year and up approximately 40% in the last three years. Reviewing the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.382 billion, and gross debt was $13.777 billion, which resulted in net debt of $12.395 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.59 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $402 million and capital expenditures were $160 million, resulting in free cash flow of $242 million. As we previously announced, in May, we issued $1.250 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We also took advantage during the quarter of our stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels and deployed $490 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $194 per share. In the first half, share repurchases totaled $619 million. Now we ended the quarter with $736 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. But our Board of Directors just authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, which brings the authorization to $2.736 billion as of today. Let's turn to the guidance. We're updating our guidance to address the impact of the continued client cautiousness we've been experiencing in the commercial business. We now anticipate this cautiousness persisting for the balance of the year. And reflecting the reduced expectations for both TAS and CSMS, we currently expect revenue to be between $15.050 billion and $15.175 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.4% to 5.3%. Total company organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, is now expected to be between 8% and 9% for the year. This revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and a step down in COVID-related revenue of approximately $600 million versus 2022. By segment, we now expect TAS to grow approximately 6%, consistent with what we saw in the first half. Our expectations for the R&DS segment are unchanged and consistent with our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect CSMS revenue to decline approximately 3%. And all of these growth rates are organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Now, to reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3.600 billion to $3.635 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.6% to 8.6%. And lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.20 to $10.45, representing year-over-year growth of 0.4% to 2.9%. This adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate. And together, these non-operational items reduced the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 12 percentage points. So excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 15%. Now let's move to our third quarter guidance. In Q3, we expect revenue to be between $3.760 billion and $3.810 billion or growth of 3.9% to 5.3% on a constant currency basis and 5.6% to 7% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $880 million and $895 million, up 8.1% to 10%. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.39 and $2.49, declining 3.6% to growing 0.4% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increase in the UK tax rate, this translates into third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of between 11% and 15%. Now, I should note that all of this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 31 continue for the balance of the year. So, let me summarize. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance, including organic revenue growth of 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Our quarterly net new bookings were the second highest ever at just under $2.7 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remains healthy with our RFP flow reaching a new record high in the quarter, up 6% sequentially versus Q1 2023. We took advantage of the stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels during the quarter and bought back almost $0.5 billion worth of shares at an average of $194 per share. On top of this, our Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, while client cautiousness and their discretionary spending is slightly reduced, our short-term outlook on the commercial side of the business, that is TAS and CSMS, the fundamentals of both the clinical and commercial markets continue to be healthy and support our confidence in the longer-term outlook for our company. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the phones for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to David Windley at Jefferies.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ari, you talked about a pretty substantial increase in trial start activity, which is encouraging, certainly. And the bookings, as you highlighted, are also pretty strong. I'm wondering if -- kind of on two points, if that is reflective of maybe pharma companies -- pharma and biotech companies kind of getting about business after some period of evaluation of pipelines; and then two, if there's any improvement in the operational environment, thinking about site staffing, labor turnover, things like that, that would help throughput on the operational side? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the environment from what we have been able to see over the past 1.5 years, two years has not changed. I know there have been rumblings about EBP funding on one hand and concerns about the impact of the IRA on the other hand. And it's true large pharma is evaluating the longer-term impact of the IRA and in that context, taking another look at their portfolio of studies, both in-flight and to come. And some of them reprioritized some of the studies. But fundamentally, our business has been sound, strong, growing sequentially every quarter. Our bookings have been beating record after record. So we really did not experience any tremor at all in the market on the R&DS side. And this quarter was just a continuation of what we had experienced. With respect to your second question about staffing and site start-up, attrition rates are back to pre-pandemic levels, which is about 10% to 12%. So, from our -- on our end, things are good. We continue to actively recruit and hire because we're growing organically at a very high rate. And therefore, we need the people to execute the work. So that recruiting is targeted at meeting the incremental demand. Obviously, there's always competition for talent. And right now, we have about 87,000 employees, and we continue to recruit thousands of people a year. So that's on our end. With respect to the site staffing issues, they saw -- frankly, we continue to see some staffing issues at some sites, but it's really, to a lesser degree than in prior, let's say, probably half a year or three quarters, and it's already dramatically reduced. So really, we are essentially getting back. I'm not going to say to 100% staffing levels at the site because there's still, again, are sporadic issues here and there, but it's not -- you're correct, it's not the severe issues we experienced perhaps six months or nine months ago. So it's much improved. Thank you, David.
David Windley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Ann Hynes at Mizuho.
Ann Hynes: Hi. Good morning. I just want to dig into TAS a little bit more. Within TAS, I know there are several sub-segments. Can you just give us growth rates or declines within the sub-segments like consulting technology and real-world evidence? And also, I think most of the pressure is coming from the consultant segment. Can you tell us just what the margin drop-through is that? So if consultant is maybe like 25% of revenue, I think it is, what's the debt margin -- negative margin drop-through? That'd be great. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. I don't think we disclosed by sub-segment, the margins, but it's very good margin, I think, put it this way. The consulting is good margin, and the analytics is also very strong margin. A lot of our analytics work is delivered out of offshore centers in Bangalore, in Manila. And we generate good margins. It's a lot of standardized work. We have workflows that we use in processes that over the years, we've refined. And that work -- when we say consulting, don't think McKenzie-type consulting. Consulting is really, again, a pricing market access study, a launch study, a sales force optimization study. So, these are operationally geared consulting services that our clients utilize to support often the launch of new drugs or the reprioritization of geographic markets or specific restructuring of their sales organization in certain geographies or in certain therapies, those types of projects. And it's not like they are not going to do them. Those must -- are must-do projects. But the environment, the climate, the higher interest rates has kind of put people on sort of on a hold pattern, if you will. The pipeline is there. No one is spending is. I am just not doing the project. And therefore, we would say, well, the prospects are lower. Now, we have -- the projects are still there, but the decision-making seems to be pushed to the right. We were hoping, frankly, up to two, three months ago that things would recover by now in terms of the decision-making and accelerate. And that's why we, frankly, we were hoping that we would get back to the 8%-or-so growth, higher single-digit growth for the TAS segment for the year. We were expecting a strong acceleration, but we haven't seen it materialize in the second quarter. And so as of now, based on what we've seen, I think it's prudent to say that this -- the type of growth rates we've seen for the segment as a whole, which is 6% organically at constant currency and not including the COVID impacts, it should be -- should continue the rest of the year. Thank you.
Ann Hynes: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Eric Coldwell at Baird. Baird, excuse me.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you very much. I had the same question as Anne, and I just wanted to follow up on that. The way we think about TAS is for us broadly defined sub-segments, data, analytics, consulting, real-world evidence and technology. I'm curious, did any of this cautiousness or sluggishness, did it expand beyond the analytics and consulting side? What are the growth trends in data, real-world evidence, tech any nuances or changes there? And then I have one quick follow-up, if I might. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: All right. Sure. Of course, Eric. Thank you. So let's start with data, right the core of the business. That has not changed. I would say 90-plus percent of our business for the year on the data side is just locked in by the month of December for the following year. So there's no change there. That's recurring revenue, and not much has happened there. The level of discretion in terms of data by here for the clients is much less than the analytics and consulting segment that we were just discussing. For the faster-growing businesses, real world and commercial tech, now let's take the technology suites. It's not like the revenue is a reflection of the sales in the year. It's -- the revenue generated in technology is longer cycle, corresponds to technology awards from prior periods, from prior years. So nothing has changed there on the revenue side. There is cautiousness, similar to consulting and analytics, on the technology side in terms of new buys and new transitions. There's a number of dislocation in technology going on right now, by the way, both on the clinical side and on the commercial side, the main CRM competitor decided to change their platform. So as a result, clients are kind reviewing their technology decisions on the technology side. We've got new innovations. We've got the main competitors there, Medidata and others and Oracle, are launching a new suite. So, there is dislocation. So, because of that, clients are kind of taking their time to review decisions, but that's not impacting our revenue in year. On the real-world side, again, some of these are longer-term studies. There is a little bit, but again, I don't think that we've seen it affect our revenue year that much. A little bit of cautiousness and perhaps a little bit of delay on the late-phase real-world studies that we've seen. Again, I'm just giving you a really high-level commentary here on -- just to really scratch the business. But fundamentally, it is a 25% piece of the TAS segment, that's consulting and analytics, that's essentially down year-over-year by, I think, about 5%, if I recall. And so everything else is pretty much stable as expected.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: What's your follow-up?
Eric Coldwell: Yeah, Mike. Thank you for the follow-up. I know you don't tend to get into details on M& A in the quarter with -- typically, these are smaller companies, sometimes higher revenue multiples. But I did notice $426 million, I believe, spent on acquisitions this quarter. I was hoping to get some sense of directionally what that might have been.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. And I think it was done towards the end of the quarter. I mean, I can tell you, so it's a company called Cognitive for which we paid almost $300 million, so clinical site network. As you know, as part of our strategy overall, we are -- we've been acquiring certain assets that have strong patient enrollment capability in specific therapies. So Cognitive is, in particular is strong in internal medicine, in CNS, in vaccines as well and has some large pharma customers. So, we -- the company is headquartered in Arizona. It's -- obviously, it's a significant multiple of revenue. But -- and we acquired that towards the end of the quarter. And we have a bunch of all smaller stuff over here, but that's the -- what else do we have here? We have a $36 million investment in a small--
Ron Bruehlman: We had one other site network we've acquired.
Ari Bousbib: Right, right, right. It management organization, yes. That was in psychiatry and smoking cessation. So again, highly specialized site benefit organization we've done a couple this past quarter.
Eric Coldwell: So you are starting to follow the path of what PPD and ICON have done in prior years with moving into the opening up the marketplace for actually being a hybrid SMO, but probably still at a very small scale, I would assume.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, yes -- no. So we had already -- we do have -- we had a network that we had started ourselves. But we -- you're correct. I don't think we -- I mean we bought maybe one other one last year, if I remember -- you're correct. Again, these are -- it's not like we are buying dozens of this, but there happens to be that coincidentally, we bought two in the quarter. And that's basically the bulk of the spend that you see there.
Eric Coldwell: Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next now to Tejas Savant at Morgan Stanley.
Tejas Savant: Hi, guys. Good morning and thanks for the time this morning. Ron, maybe one for you and a quick follow-up on the M&A side for Ari as well, if I may. So Ron, first for you, I mean, margins in the midpoint look to be expanding nicely here into the fourth quarter as implied by your third quarter guide. Can you just walk us through sort of what drives your confidence in that sort of margin expansion into year-end? And then on the M&A side, Ari, we noticed that the Propel Media acquisition from earlier in the year is being blocked by the FTC at the moment. We had some new merger review guidelines, draft guidelines admittedly, put out a couple of weeks ago as well. Does it concern you that you need to sort of rejig your M&A strategy here in light of like some of these recent developments?
Ron Bruehlman: I'll take the margin question first, Tejas. Look, there were a couple of things here. Number one, we've had market expansion all year. So it's really good indicator that it's credible to say we're going to have it in the back half of the year. We have a number of productivity initiatives underway to reduce cost. And those tend to be, of course, more back-end loaded. You get more benefit as you go through the year. So that's certainly going to support margins in the back half of the year. I think you have -- another thing that's happening is some of the labor cost pressure that we've been feeling over time on a year-over-year basis. You're starting to kind of lap that and get more pricing benefit in as well. So it's a combination of factors. Now all those factors overcome a little bit of drag from mix. For instance, the info business, which is -- tends to be a profitable business, never grows as fast as the rest of the business. So we're very confident in the margin outlook for the back half of the year, and those are the reasons.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. And the question on the acquisition that we're trying to do that we -- really is, I think, about a year. You know that we have a strategy to continue to grow in the digital space. Our strategy remains intact. We've seen those merger guidelines. Look, I'm not going to comment on the pending litigation with the FTC because planning litigation. We continue to believe strongly that there is absolutely zero logic to blocking this transaction. But we are aware that there are a few novel theories that are being promoted by this administration of the FTC. And listen, administrations come and go. And we are not going to change our M&A strategy. We believe that we are still a very small player in a hugely massive digital promotional market. I mean you've got the Googles of this world, giants that also participate in this market. And we have a right to participate in this market. We are serving the life sciences industry and their needs. And our customers welcome that development and our ability to offer those services. We believe that this acquisition actually increases the degree of intensity of competition in this market and actually allows all other participants to counter the essential strong behemoths that dominate the digital space today. So we just simply do not understand the FTC's arguments, and I'll leave it at that.
Tejas Savant: Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.
Ari Bousbib: You’re welcome.
Operator: We'll go next now to Luke Sergott at Barclays.
Luke Sergott: Good morning, guys. Thanks again for the questions. So you were talking about a little bit about decision-making getting elongated and I know that, that was on parts of the TAS business. But can you talk -- can you give us a sense of how much longer that has gotten? It typically takes for you guys, like, let's say, two months or three months to close a certain deal and now that that's six months. Just give us some type of framework on how long that has gotten. And then as you guys think about things recovering, I assume that there's also some delayed decision-making on the big -- the R&DS side. So when things start to turn around, is it safe to assume that the RDS side comes back before the TAS side when -- on this decision-making process?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks for the question, Luke. I'm not sure what you mean by R&DS coming back. I mean it's very strong. The R&DS segment is not experiencing any delays in decision-making that we can see, frankly. Again, we had another record quarter of bookings. Nothing's changed there. And our RFP flow, again, is at a record level. I could spend time giving you stats on the -- on our leading indicator metrics on the R&DS side, a qualified pipeline and the pipeline overall and so on are at a record high, and recontinue our sales activities as before, again, nothing -- no sign of delaying decision making on R&DS side. I want to be very clear on that. On the TAS segment and CSMS and again, it's largely affecting the consulting and analytics segment. And I would say almost exclusively, the issue is I can't quantify in month. I mean the stuff that's in our pipe that we've had since the end of last year. And here we are, August 1, and the clients on that specific opportunity still hasn't decided to -- everything is negotiated, and they know they have to do the study, but they could do the study next year. So. whatever clients -- on that side of the business, clients are basically saying to themselves, well, do I need to do this now? Or can I keep the can another few months? So. this stuff has been our pipeline six months, and we haven't taken it out because the client still is telling us that they want to do it. They just haven't signed yet. So, yes, I mean it's a bit in the time frame that you're talking about. It would have taken a month or two, and it's taking six months or more.
Luke Sergott: Okay. And I guess I -- sorry for implying that you guys were seeing the RDS weakness or delays there in decision-making. It's just going more of an overall pharma comment. And on that decision-making on the TAS, is that more due to them, like your customers, focusing more on where they're going to place their bets and deploy that capital for the clinical trials and then kind of the TAS stuff is like a secondary knock-on or secondary benefit that you guys offer?
Ari Bousbib: It's really all over. Every client has -- it's hard to -- it weighs on everyone. Is there going to be a recession? Is there going to be a recession? Maybe we should delay the launch in Portugal. Maybe we should not look at our sales force now. If we do this next year, maybe that project that we were planning to do -- to evaluate whether we should adjust pricing in consideration of the IRA implications and so on, on this drug, in that market, in that therapy, we push it back. So it's not like I can give you a blanket answer. It's just the environment, the atmospherics are such that -- look, I'm sure someone is going to ask me a question, and I'm assuming it's going to be Shlomo, but our cash flow wasn't too special this past quarter and is the same thing. Why are large pharma companies that are sitting on massive piles of cash not paying their bills on time? Our collections are not where they should be. And it's just -- it's a high interest environment. So people tend to just find all kinds of reasons why there was a comma missing in an invoice, and therefore, we can't pay you and send me by the invoice in two weeks. It's just the environment. I don't have another answer.
Luke Sergott: Got you. That's helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Luke.
Operator: And we'll go next now to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.
Ari Bousbib: Here we go.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hey, Ari. I still get a question, even though you asked that one, right?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: All right. Thank you. Actually, just -- I wanted to touch on one, just a metric and then maybe follow-up with another one just more oil broad. Just if you could talk to -- just tell us what the growth rate on real-world evidence was in the quarter. And then, Ari, maybe just if you could talk a little bit about, in terms of AI, you gave us a little bit of a teaser. But can you talk a little bit about just where you might have unique advantages, either because of the investments you've made in AI over the last bunch of years or just because of the uniqueness of the information that you've aggregated? Is there anything that's out there in market that's really unique right now? Or is this really stuff that's going to be on the comp? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. So quickly on the real-world evidence, it's been double-digits for one and it's still strong double-digits. So nothing changed there. With respect to AI, we're obviously very excited by the opportunity. This is not new for us, right? I mean we've been working on this for a long time. We've invested since 2015, 2016, and we own the number of market-leading and proprietary AI software engines. We've dedicated AI/ML resources for a long time. And we are extremely well positioned. We apply AI in drug development, discovery, clinical development, safety, market access, medical affairs and, of course, in commercialization to inform promotional and sales and targeting activities. We are using AI in NLP processes, in translations of medical documentations and protocols. That's for the offering part of the business, if you will. On the internal side, we've applied AI to many of our own internal processes. For example, lead to cash, we -- really across a set of processes to create efficiencies operationally. So it is a great opportunity for us and has been for the past few years. Now, how do you use AI to gain competitive advantages? It helps optimize site identification based on the patient populations that we derive from our -- that we mine in our databases, helps optimize patient recruitment techniques based on data and analytical footprint. It helps optimize development -- drug development protocols. We can -- we have support -- it has built predictive enrollment models based on all the protocol criteria thresholds. You're familiar with the next best application in our OCE suite, which leverages the know-how and the historical data to create predictive models of engagement with customers. We've also been developing a novel biomarker database with IQVIA's own natural language processing tools. We've used it in Alzheimer's studies to have an early identification and recruitment of patients with most likely to develop Alzheimer's. A lot of activities, frankly, to expand patient pathways. So if you look into -- I'm sure it's somewhere in our websites or literature, we have over 150 patent pending methodologies and algorithms, more than 30 predictive data disease models, more than 300 life science-specific analytical libraries, I mean I could go on and on. We've got a lot of stuff here on proprietary material in AI. Now this whole buzz around generative AI, as people are finding out, it's not so easy to apply and actually derive precise and relevant insights. And I'm looking forward to presenting why even using -- and by the way, we are working with -- everyone has announced significant generative AI applications and models because it's really -- as always, it's -- if you don't have access to the business rules and to the relevant content, you're going to come up with what they call hallucinations. And we've tried it and we are working with partners -- with technology partners, and it's very clear that we have the sauce internally here that would enable those large language model tools to be a lot more effective and accurate and precise than what they are today in the world of life sciences, where they basically only have access to what's available on the Internet or on public sources. That's why I can say now, but again, it's a very exciting development. Obviously, we are very busy leveraging internally. And there was a question earlier on margins and margin expansion, and it's one of the several initiatives that is helping us generate margin expansion.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: We go next now to Jailendra Singh at Truist.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. I actually want to ask about data and information offerings business for you guys. One of your competitors recently talked about coming up with competitive solutions in that space for pharma companies. I understand this is a more stable and high-margin, very sticky business for you guys. But just remind us about your positioning there and what makes the barriers to entry high in that business.
Ari Bousbib: You are asking about the data business?
Jailendra Singh: Yes, yes.
Ari Bousbib: Okay.
Nick Childs: Comments that Dave has made in terms of data.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, okay. Yes. I mean, look, I don't know what to say here. It's just not the same planet, the only way I can put it. The scale, the global presence in over 100 countries, the level of granularity, the infrastructure -- the IT infrastructure to process, cleanse, cure, connect all that data on a global basis, the business rooms. I mean look at health care, data is chaos. It's -- you can have as much data as you want. If you don't understand it and connect it and cleanse it and know what you're dealing with, it's not really relevant. We have data on about 1.4 billion...
Nick Childs: 1.2 billion.
Ari Bousbib: 1.2 billion patients. And that -- I don't think there's anyone that has anything resembling what we have. I mean I just don't know what it's like.
Ron Bruehlman: We've been at it since the early 1950s, Jailendra. That should tell you something. I mean you don't -- there's nothing that would stop somebody technically from recreating what we have in data if they have 70 years and all the expertise we have.
Jailendra Singh: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Ron Bruehlman: Thank you.
Nick Childs: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again on our third quarter earnings call. The team and I will be available the rest of the day to take any other follow-up questions you may have. Thanks for joining.
Operator: Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. We'll conclude the IQVIA Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. But thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great day. Good bye.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 09:25:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Param, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you very much, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. This was another quarter where we delivered again on all our financial targets. Our revenue grew 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The diversification of our short and long-cycle businesses allowed us to perform well in the quarter despite the broader macroeconomic dynamics. The demand environment for our industry continues to be healthy. Global clinical trial activity remains resilient and the prospects for our commercial business remain favorable. A few encouraging signs I'd like to share with you this morning, the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies together spent a record setting $138 billion on research and development in 2022. According to BioWorld, the Q1 EBT [ph] funding was $15.6 billion. That was up double digit versus prior year and up sequentially versus Q4. March was a particularly strong month for EBT funding despite concerns about the impact from the banking crisis. FDA approvals are off to a strong start in 2023. There were 13 approvals in the first quarter. That's up from an average of 9 over the prior 5 years. And that's a positive indicator for our commercial business. There was a significant M&A activity in Q1, which primarily is large pharma acquiring smaller companies and the industry expects 2023 M&A spend to be one of the largest years in the last decade. This highlights the ongoing demand for molecules by large pharma. Internally, our Q1 demand metrics show continued healthy growth. I'll share a couple with you this morning. Net new bookings were $2.6 billion. That represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. As a result, our backlog reached a new record and grew 10.1% versus prior year on a reported basis and 11.3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our RFP flow set a new quarterly record. It was up sequentially 15%, versus Q4 2022. Operationally, attrition levels have continued to decline, and they are now, in fact, back to pre-pandemic levels or slightly below that. Site selection was up double digits year-over-year. This increased productivity helped mitigate the unfavorable impact of the staff's proteges [ph] that investigator site that we spoke about in prior calls. R&DS organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, was 17% in the quarter. That was well above the upper end of our expectations. Within TAS, we continue to see some client cautiousness related to discretionary spending. TAS growth for the quarter was 6% organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, and that was within our expectations, but towards the lower end. In summary, industry demand remains healthy despite some cautiousness in discretionary spending, mostly in the short-cycle businesses. The diversification of our businesses allows us to balance the current slower short-cycle growth with the resilience of our long-cycle businesses, demonstrating that IQVIA is a company that can operate effectively under different macro environments. And with that, as context, let me review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.4% on a reported basis, 4.7% at constant currency and compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line as a company, 11% at constant currency on an organic basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 4.8%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.45 declined slightly as expected driven by the onetime step-up in interest rates. Excluding interest expense and the U.K. tax rate headwinds that we discussed in the prior call, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded 9%. I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter. Within TAS, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA, our first omnichannel marketing deal in the Asia Pacific region. IQVIA's omnichannel marketing program provides client teams with AI ML powered insights and recommendations to deliver effective personalized digital engagements with ACP [ph] In the quarter, IQVIA won an award for our in-home patient services offering. This biotech client is launching a new MS treatment and selected IQVIA based on our ability to deliver testing and monitoring to the patient's home. These differentiated capabilities ease the burden for patients with limited mobility. Moving to the real-world part of our TAS business. IQVIA was awarded a major post authorization safety study to assess the impact and outcomes of prescribing a certain asthma drug to pregnant women with severe asthma. We won this large contract with a top 10 pharma client due to the breadth of our capabilities, including our relevant experience in the safety trials, our strong data and analytics capabilities and increased delivery efficiency with faster patient enrollment. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a large global intervention study with a top 10 pharma to identify high-risk cardiovascular patients by measuring the prevalence of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This protein is produced by the liver in response to inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of this protein in the blood are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. IQVIA was selected based on our ability to connect lab and clinical capabilities with therapeutic and real-world expertise in a cost-efficient manner. This study will have a significant impact on the future management of cardiovascular patients. Moving to R&DS. Continued strong momentum with our $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, translating into a book-to-bill of 1.28 in quarter, which brings our LTM book-to-bill to 1.35 in. A few highlights in the quarter. Oncology continues to be our largest therapeutic area. And in the quarter, a high-profile cutting-edge biotech company entered into a strategic partnership with IQVIA. This is a big deal. In fact, we were already awarded our first trial, which is for a novel bispecific antibody with potential development opportunities across several tumor types. Bispecific antibodies are designed to bind 2 different target molecules simultaneously. This project will leverage our end-to-end clinical trial solution, including protocol design, specialized medical and regulatory expertise, biomarker development and our integrated clinical operations, analytics and technology. We really are the only company with the ability to bring together these capabilities which, in turn, helped the client optimize trial design and reduce time to market. Importantly, going forward, this partnership creates multiple opportunities within this client's large oncology portfolio. We continue to have strong success with our clinical FSP [ph] trials business with several recent notable wins, including a significant preferred provider award with a major pharma. This was a competitive win against two incumbents and it further diversifies our portfolio of FSP clients and increases our share in that segment. We continue to deploy innovations in our clinical technology suite. Most recently, we introduced a new cloud-based platform within our research site network that will streamline document workflows and allow real-time collaboration among study teams. We already deployed this new technology to approximately 15% of IQVIA network sites across 28 countries, and we expect to deploy it to 40% of our sites in the next 12 months. The goal of deploying this technology at the site is to increase site productivity, which frees up more time for site support, compliance reviews and continuous monitoring of patient safety and study quality all of which are very important, especially in an environment where we experienced staff shortages at the site. Finally, a couple of nice accolades for our global IQVIA team. First, I am proud to share that our lab business received the prestigious Singaporean President Certificate of commendation, which is awarded to organizations that had a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19. In fact, five of our employees in Singapore received a Public Service Medal Award for their outstanding contributions to manage the impact of the pandemic. This is a nice recognition of the unique role we play in supporting public health. Second, our Scotland-based lab business recently achieved a global green lab certification for its commitment to practicing sustainable science. This certification is recognized by the United Nation's "Race to Zero" global campaign as the international gold standard for lab sustainability best practices towards a zero carbon future. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.652 billion grew 2.4% on a reported basis and 4.7% at constant currencies. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $150 million, which was down about $230 million versus the first quarter of 2022. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 11%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.444 billion, up 0.3% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.026 billion [ph] was up 4.8% reported and 6.5% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $182 million declined 6.7% reported and 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, the organic growth decline at constant currency was also 1% in CSMS. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $851 million for the first quarter, that's growth of 4.8%. GAAP net income was $289 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.53. Adjusted net income was $462 million in adjusted earnings per share diluted was $2.45. So as already highlighted, R&D Solutions continues its strong momentum. This graph shows the growth of our backlog over the past 3 years, which demonstrates the sustained growth of our clinical business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $27.9 billion which was up over 40% over the last 3 years and growing 10% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.494 billion. Gross debt was $13.176 billion, and that resulted in net debt of $11.682 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was strong at $417 million, and CapEx was $164 million, resulting in free cash flow of $253 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $129 million of shares, and that leaves us with slightly over $1.2 billion remaining under the current program. Let's go now to the guidance. Guidance for the full year 2023 remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency between 9% and 11%. And this revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022. We're also reaffirming our guidance on adjusted EBITDA of $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, and that represents year-over-year growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Lastly, we're reaffirming our guidance on adjusted diluted EPS of $10.26 to $10.56. And this adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes a year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate. And together, these nonoperational items impact the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 10 percentage points. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 11% to 14%. Let's move to our second quarter guidance. In Q2, we expect revenue to be between $3.675 billion and $3.750 billion. That's growth of 3.7% to 5.8% on a constant currency basis and 3.8% to 5.9% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $850 million and $875 million, which would be up 6.3% to 9.4%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.30 and $2.44, declining 5.7% to flat on a year-over-year basis. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the toughest compare for interest expense because we had a very favorable $1 billion swap roll off on March 31. It was also a year ago that rates started rising. So excluding the step-up of an interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 8% and 13% in the second quarter. Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of April 25 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, Q1 was another solid quarter of financial performance. We delivered revenue growth of 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Underlying demand in the industry and in our business remains healthy with our RFPs accelerating in Q1 up 15% sequentially versus Q4 2022. And quarterly net new bookings were $2.6 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $27.9 billion, representing growth of over 10% year-over-year. We've been navigating well through the choppy macro environment and delivering on our numbers. Despite some of the cautiousness we've observed in the short-cycle discretionary spend, thanks to the resilience and the rest of the portfolio, which is mostly the long cycle and thus less affected by macro turbulent. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, excluding nonoperational items. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel. Your line is open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Ari, can you talk a little bit about the nature of the backlog burn? You had very strong bookings, you got strong book-to-bill, but the amount of revenue expected to - or backlog to convert to revenue, it seems kind of consistent for this quarter to last quarter? Or is there any - is there a change of mix over there? Is that a rounding item? Or is there something else that might be going on over there?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. No. Look, we had very strong bookings. It was one of our highest bookings quarter and I wouldn't read anything. It's not the first time, by the way, that Q1 next 12 months revenue from bookings is essentially flat to Q4. Next 12 months bookings, I can't detect any seasonality to that, but it's not the first time it happened. So I wouldn't read anything into it at all. It's just a question of mix, months of pass-throughs that are taken into the quarter or delayed. And we're reverting to more regular mix of projects with, as you know, an increasing share in oncology, which typically burn a little slower. That might have a little bit at the margins of an impact. But I wouldn't read anything into it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thanks, Shlomo.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Anne Samuel: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could speak to some of the dynamics within the TAS business. In the fourth quarter, the analytics and consulting business was impacted, but some of that maybe seems like it was unique to December purchasing patterns. So how much of this is carryover from what you saw in the fourth quarter? And then what's driving your confidence that it's going to come back in the remainder of the year so that you could hit your guidance?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Anne. It's a good question. Look, TAS growth in the first quarter was within the range we expected. You are correct that the guidance we gave on an organic constant currency ex COVID basis for the year, I think our guidance is 7% to 9%. And therefore, 6% clearly is right under that. But we did tell you that we did fully expect Q1 to be just under that. So our expectations were more in the 6% to 7%, 6% to 8% for the first quarter and we expected a slower start as you suggest, due to the cautiousness we saw in December in customers' discretionary spending and so we assume this was going to spill over, as you suggest, into the Q1, and that's why we assume a slower start in the year for this business. The reason why it's a little lower than our long-term growth expectation is due to the analytics and consulting business piece of TAS. That is about, I want to say, just under 25% of the total business in TAS. And as we said many times before, it's the shortest cycle and contains the most discretionary spend activity of the entire TAS portfolio. So what we are seeing is not cancellations of projects, not decisions to not conduct the projects. For the most part, these are projects that need to be done, pricing and market access studies, as an example, have to be done at some point. But the discretionary aspect applies to timing for the most part, okay? No one has a project that they don't need to do. These are products that need to be done, but they don't need to be done right this second. And we are seeing customers delaying decisions and pushing things to the right. That is what gives us confidence that in the latter part of the year, those projects will have to be done. So that's why we maintain our 7% to 9% organic constant currency excluding guidance for the year. Now we expect that cautiousness to continue into the second quarter. And we're assuming growth so far in line with the first quarter. Again, we're not seeing any customers walking away from projects or canceling anything. It's just consistent with what we saw at the end of Q4, delaying a project. We do expect the situation to improve in the second half because the pipelines are stronger and the customers eventually need to actually spend on those projects.
Anne Samuel: That's extremely helpful color. Thank you so much.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley at Jefferies. Your line is open.
David Windley: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Ari, I wondered if you could talk in the R&DS business. As you highlight, strong bookings, I guess, seasonally different from the fourth quarter. The thing that we're seeing, I guess, in our data review is that a lot of studies, similar to what you're describing in TAS in consulting that a lot of studies are kind of sitting in a limbo point and not moving forward into first patient in and kind of more productive revenue stages of the trial. And I wondered if you have some insights into that. And if any of your tools can help them move those forward? Or is it kind of a funding and financial issue that is keeping them from moving forward? I'd be curious your views there.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well Dave, thanks for the question. I want to use the opportunity to state as clearly and definitively as I can. We simply are not, I repeat, we are not seeing any of what you suggest. And no one is - first of all, on the funding question, I don't know how many times I'm going to repeat it. I've been doing this for five quarters in a row. We are not seeing any funding issue. In my introductory remarks, I share some of the statistics. Actually everything is up on the funding front. So we are not seeing any delays, any unusual cancellations, any postponing of decision-making within our portfolio. It could be that others are saying that we just are not seeing it. Once again, the overall RFP flow is at a record high. It's up 15% sequentially versus Q4 of '22 both the mid and the EBP segments are up strong double digits. I said before, it's up 15%. The qualified pipeline, which is, again, an even earlier indicator, is up almost up 8%. It's actually over 8% year-over-year, and it's almost $15 billion with, again, a record qualified pipeline. The total pipeline is over $25 billion. Also mid [ph] more than 5% growth year-over-year, $2.6 billion of net bookings in the quarter, it's more than the entire backlog of some of our smaller competitors out there. Our book-to-bill 1.28 is extremely strong in the current environment. And I think from what I've seen, the highest of any of our peers. Our backlog is up more than 10% year-over-year. That's on a reported basis. Excluding FX, it's up 11.3%. So again, what I'm trying to share some metrics with you here, if we look at by segment, again, it's across the board, large mid EBP. I've got a lot of numbers here, but everything is - honestly, everything is green here. Nick, do you have any other color to add to this?
Nick Childs: Yes. I guess, Dave, I think the only thing I would say there is we saw your question sort of earlier this week and talked to the team, and we're not seeing any sort of slowdown in terms of clients not wanting to start trials. I mean as soon as they're signing and pushing and getting ready, they are pushing trials forward. So we're not seeing any delays, clients trying to slow down starts. We are seeing same trials move forward and not - and not seeing the dynamics that you're asking about.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. And Dave, if there's any slowness anywhere, it's just in some of the execution because of the labor issues at some of the sites. That would be the one place where we could burn faster and the industry could burn faster if there weren't the labor issues at the site.
Ari Bousbib: Right. And as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have been able to offset some of that unfavorable impact of stock shortages that Ron just brought up and we talked about before because site selection has been accelerating. I mentioned it was up double digits year-over-year and that increased productivity helped us in the quarter, and we expect we'll continue to do so the rest of the year. We also - I mentioned also in my introductory remarks, are introducing rapidly more technology at the site in order to free up personnel time and increase our productivity.
David Windley: Yes. Very, very fulsome answer. If I could just add to that. I mean, there's been a lot of companies this week that have attributed weakness to - I mean, there are a lot of other companies seeing dramatic slowdowns. Maybe you could talk about how your positioning or your stage of the pipeline is different that also protects you from what they are seeing, Thermo, Danaher, et cetera.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean the answer is in your question. We have a very strong momentum. We operate the vast majority of what we do is in the sweet spot of the clinical trial process, it's Phase III stuff. We're not affected by the primate issue, zero. And even in the primate issue continues for the next 3 years, you wouldn't see it at all in our numbers. We've already looked at that. And we continue to gain share. I know I gave examples on the FSP segment, it's true across the board in oncology, we just are winning in the marketplace. We displaced incumbents in a number of occasions with large clients. I think I don't see any - really no issues whatsoever on the R&DS front, not say for the execution and operational issues we have encountered. I mentioned that the attrition levels are coming down. I mean, I said before that the peak of the attrition a year ago, so we had more than 20% attrition, which is horrendous and we're now back to - I said pre-pandemic levels, actually well below that, which is barely over 10%, which is amazing and very good. And that enables us to do a lot more work, a lot faster. Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell at Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks, good morning. I want to hit on reimbursables on a couple of fronts. First off, on revenue was such a big COVID comp this quarter, I would have expected less reimbursable revenue, it looks like it actually grew quite a bit faster than service revenue. So what is the dynamic there? We're seeing mixed bag all over the industry in terms of the pass-through volatility with that big COVID headwind, I would have expected less you did more. Is there something underlying or outside of COVID exposure that's driving the reimbursables higher? Or is it just company-specific contract timing?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well, look, on a full year basis, we're expecting actually obviously less reimbursable expenses because of the disappearance of the COVID work, which was, as you suggest, very high pass-through expenses for those COVID vaccine trials. I wouldn't read much in the quarter because this volatility and depends on the mix of what you executed. So I don't -- I'm not -- to be honest, the book-to-bill is more or less similar to we -- I think you -- I read you know , I religiously do that before the call, your first flash note and you asked why we only reported our 606, our book-to-bill at 1.28. And by the way, I asked the same question to the team when they gave me the first draft and I agree with the rationale. As you've seen in recent quarters, essentially the numbers have tended to converge, which is essentially what we expected to happen. We will give you the breakdown or the ex reimbursable expenses book-to-bill, when we think there is -- when there is a big discrepancy and it is a significant and helps give you understanding of what happened in the quarter in terms of bookings. But if it's very close as it was last quarter as it is this quarter, which is not going to do that. The change to 606 standard that happened more than 5 years ago and none of our competitors actually disclosed that level of granularity or report any extra reimbursable expenses book-to-bill. But again, I wouldn't read and you might more here in the quarter, Nick or Ron, any commentary or color on Eric's question.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. Look, we did have a little bit higher revenue from pass-throughs in the quarter. But as Ari said, I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-to-quarter and over a longer time period, you're analysis is correct with COVID work rolling off, there should be a decline in pass-through revenues. And yes, it's exactly on the book-to-bill. We just -- we're what 5 years in 6, 7 years in now since the change in the accounting and we'll only talk to on the book-to-bill, the services versus pass-through book-to-bill on the 605 versus 606 when there's a significant difference to talk about, and there wasn't this quarter.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. And Eric, the - just on the past because again, we -- I mentioned we did execute faster this past quarter on our NDS backlog. It's true we built - we accelerated. That's a - this is why we recognize more revenue. And as a result, there were more pass-through during the first quarter. I don't know that it's going - I don't think you'll see the same in the next few quarters based on the modeling I saw.
Eric Coldwell: Can I have one follow-up?
Ari Bousbib: Normally, no, but it's you. Go ahead. Thank you.
Eric Coldwell: I just wanted to hit on cash flow and expectations for the year, and we're juggling through overlapping reports here. So I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you mention what the DSO was in the quarter?
Ron Bruehlman: No, we didn't give an explicit DSO number. In fact, we don't typically give a number. You guys can back calculate. We were happy with the cash flow in the quarter. One thing I would want to remind everyone is in the first quarter, it's typically a weak quarter for cash flow because most of our incentive comp -- annual incentive comp is paid in the first quarter. Yes, there's some tax impacts too. Incentive comp is probably the biggest. It was strong. We were happy with our cash flow and not quite as strong as last year, but last year was an unusually strong first quarter for cash flow.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So if we improved it's flattish, right?
Ron Bruehlman: DSOs on a quarter-to-quarter basis is fairly flattish. On a year-over-year basis, it's up a little bit and a lot of that has to do with the burning through the COVID-related advances that we got. So it was fully expected.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Smock at William Blair. Your line is now open.
Max Smock: I just wanted to clarify your comment in response to one of Dave's questions earlier about the NHP situation. And I just wanted to clarify, you said that you would not see any impact from the NHP shortage even if it continues for the next 3 years. Just wondering, at some point, wouldn't that limit the number of drugs getting into later-stage trials here? Just would be great to hear more about the work you've done internally to kind of evaluate your potential exposure over the next...
Ari Bousbib: Again, in theory, yes, but we don't expect that to happen. I mean there will be eventually other models, and they will become available. I mean, I don't -- we're not worried about this at all.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. The 3 years just related to the length of time it takes to get from the discovery work in the Phase II and Phase III trials. There's a long delay between that. So yes, of course, theoretically, if there is a protracted issue, it affects everybody in the industry. We don't expect that to happen.
Max Smock: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper at Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
Sandy Draper: Thanks very much. I think it sounds like I need to get on Eric's distribution list. I can get his quick flash notes. I can't process fast enough to do that. So my question, Ari, or maybe Ron, is on the backlog burn. I'm trying to reconcile what you were talking about interest [ph] question. On my calculation, it looks like the backlog burn stepped down a little bit from the fourth quarter from 8% to 7.4%. My assumption was there's a little bit less sequentially in terms of reimbursables. So I just wanted to verify that. But then thinking about how you're expecting the backlog burn to play out as you have less COVID work, et cetera, which is faster burning, do you think is it reasonable to think stable off of this 7.4% Or would it sort of trend down over the course of the year? Thanks.
Ron Bruehlman: Look, I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on quarter-to-quarter backlog burn as you calculate it there. It's not something that we pay a lot of attention to internally. I can tell you, you'll get variations like in the fourth quarter, we had very strong pass-through bookings, which pushes up the backlog some, but then those tend to burn later in the trial. And you'll see impacts like that affect any one quarter, like particularly the next quarter's burn rate. So overall, as Ari made the point, we tend to work on more complicated trials in oncology trials, in particular, tend to be longer, slower burn trial. So we may have slower burn on average than some of the others in the industry based upon our particular mix of projects, but that's more a macro long-term consideration than it is a quarter-to-quarter sort of variation driver.
Sandy Draper: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks, Ron.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Lucas on for Charles. I want to dig into the TAS segment. You guys talked about consulting and analytics seeing some softness in 1Q. You guys also called out some wins in real-world evidence. Can you talk more about the performance of the other offerings within TAS and how they performed in 1Q, more specifically real-world evidence and technology platforms?
Ron Bruehlman: Look, our real world and technology, we tend to talk about them together because they're the faster growers and continued to be very solid growers in the quarter. As Ari pointed out, it was the analytics and consulting business that really slowed down in the quarter because a lot of that is shorter cycle business and can be delayed. We've always talked about information being a slower grower. So you know about that. And so you kind of piece it together, the difference versus prior quarters really relates to the analytics and consulting business, some of that shorter cycle business being delayed. It's really as simple as that. That's why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the underlying core growth rate in the TAS business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Will Chaff on for Derik. I know in the prepared remarks, you flagged that there has been a pickup of biotech M&A, which obviously is helping the funding environment. But I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of the larger of the acquirer than reducing the R&D spend at the target. Is there any impact to you from that? Yes, if you could just explore those dynamics, that would be great.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you. Just to clarify, the M&A spend has nothing to do with funding. It's not included in the funding numbers. So these are two different and independent points. The heightened M&A activity is a plus, obviously, and is a tailwind for us. As you know, we've got large clients that are buying molecules for which work needs to be done. So this is generally a favorable trend for us. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard at Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. I was just hoping you could revisit that comment you made that RFPs grew 15% sequentially and I assume that's a volume number. And is there any difference between RFP volume trends and value trends? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. No, your assumption is incorrect. The growth numbers we mentioned are in dollars.
Nick Childs: Yes. So all the growth numbers that we've given, Dan, on the call are all dollar-based. It's not a volume.
Ron Bruehlman: And that's how we tend to track it because that's what's important.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I know you said you just talked about it in terms of total dollar volume. I was just wondering if you could comment on the contribution in terms of pricing and R&DS to the dollars this year? And then secondly, just in terms of the pacing of TAS revenue over the back half of the year. Are you still thinking we should see that continue to accelerate be sort of in that like sort of mid- to high single-digit type range? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. The comment on TAS is just correct. That's our expectation currently based on the pipeline. What was the first question? I'm sorry.
Nick Childs: Yes, I didn't hear your first question there, I'm sorry.
Elizabeth Anderson: Sure. It was just in terms of the contribution of sort of increases in pricing that could have contributed to the first quarter revenue results on a year-over-year basis?
Ari Bousbib: Nothing was negligible.
Nick Childs: Yes. I mean I wouldn't say if anything large, Elizabeth. I mean, again, you got to remember, trials are kind of vary from 3 to 5 years, it takes a while for all the pricing to pick up. We don't get that all and get it all upfront. So the pricing leads in over the course of the trials. Okay. And we will take one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Justin Bowers at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Justin Bowers: Thank you. Just sort of a two-parter. One with RWE, are you seeing any change in the velocity of demand there for that business, hearing in the marketplace that IRA might be a bit of a tailwind for that? And then can you also sort of educate us a little bit on the lead time between when market access and pricing studies are done and with respect to FDA approvals? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Justin. On the first question, Nick, you have any...
Nick Childs: You said the growth on real world - nothing different.
Ron Bruehlman: Remains strong.
Ari Bousbib: Remains very strong, same. Nothing - really nothing changed on the real-world side. On the -- it really, really varies. There are clients who like to start even before FDA approval, sometimes well before when the early results are strong, data is good in the trial, they get - they want to get prepared. And we do those studies early, sometimes it's around the time of the approval. Sometimes it's a little later. Again, it depends, by the way, it depends on the market. Some clients may decide to introduce a drug in Europe or in some markets in Europe before others, et cetera, and it has to do with when the approvals in specific geographies occur. So it really varies. There's no [indiscernible] lead time. And that's why, again, quarter-on-quarter is discretionary. It's going to have to be done, but you can delay when you do it.
Justin Bowers: Yes. I appreciate it. And just on RWE, just some of the things we're picking up in the field is that sponsors are leaning into those more or are thinking about leaning into those more as it relates to the IR legislation? And if I may, just on R&DS, just a quick follow-up there. Are you guys on the market share gains that you're making there? Is there any specific area? Or is it - are you seeing it across the board in both full service [indiscernible].
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Justin, thank you for your four questions. And I'm just going to answer briefly the last one, and then I suggest that the team will be available here the rest of the day and the next few days to answer any further questions. But the - on your question about market share, there's no way around it. I've said it before, and we again did this quarter. We have a high book-to-bill ratio around on the largest base revenue, you can assume that there is a gain share that's ongoing. The specific segments, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, in oncology, we know we are growing a lot faster and we are gaining share, that's by therapeutic area. And then in terms of the segments, again, it's across the board, but it was particularly significant this past quarter in FSP as well. So that's the color I can give you on share. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Childs, I'll turn the call back over to you.
Nick Childs: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you again on our second quarter earnings call. Myself and the team will be available the rest of the day to take any other follow-up questions you might have. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations Web site at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. As we close 2022, we are very proud of what we've achieved at IQVIA. It was a record year for our R&DS business, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion, which was the highest ever, our backlog stands now at a record $27.2 billion, and the business added over 275 new customers in the year. We improved access to critical research; we've expanded our decentralized clinical trial capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso. Our DCT program achieved GDPR validation in Europe, marking the first time a DCT offering received this data privacy validation. And our connected devices business added 50 new customers, including wins with two top-10 pharma companies. We made significant advancements as well in our real world business. We increased the number of active data sources by more than 30% across more than 50 countries, and we enhanced access to real world data for European and U.S. regulators through our partnerships with European Medicines Agency and the Real-World Alliance. We expanded our digital marketing capabilities with the acquisition of Lasso Marketing, which offers a technology purpose-built for healthcare marketers to execute digital campaigns. We deployed capital of $3.7 billion during the year. This included $1.3 billion in acquisitions, $1.2 billion in share repurchase, $700 million in CapEx, and repayment of $510 million of debt. At the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3.45 times adjusted EBITDA. 2022 also marked the end of our Vision 22 three-year strategic plan. No one could have predicted the volatile macro environment we would have to operate in during this period. Despite the many headwinds we have faced, since 2019, when we set these goals, we in fact exceeded our Vision 2022 goals. I am proud of the resilience, resourcefulness, and creativity that our employees around the world demonstrate every day in support of IQVIA's mission. It is these attributes that allowed our company to deliver on the commitments we made to you in 2019. And as you know, since the beginning of '22, the industry has been reporting a slowdown in demand for clinical and commercial services caused by reductions in biotech funding, as well as the higher interest rate environment and macro economic uncertainty. As we've discussed before, while we've of course seen anecdotal evidence of these concerns we, at IQVIA, remain confident that the fundamentals of our industry and the demand from our clients remain healthy. And, in fact, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 goals. As we begin 2023, there are more molecules in development than at any other time in history. Our RFP flow was up 13% for the full-year. We, in fact, saw acceleration in Q4 to 22%, with double-digit growth in all three segments; large, midsize, and EBP segments. Our net new business reached a record $3.1 billion in Q4, which is up 29% versus prior year. For the full-year, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion despite the large COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. And yes, in our commercial business, while we are seeing some short-term fluctuations in discretionary spend categories such as, for example, consulting, demand for our commercial services nonetheless remains on a favorable growth trend. Finally, let me just acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company received last week. IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the sixth consecutive year. Importantly, once again, we earned the first place ranking within our industry group. We also rank number one in seven out of nine categories, including innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of products and services, global competitiveness, and long-term investment value. Turning now to the results for the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.8% on a reported basis, 7% at constant currency compared to last year. And excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 10% at constant currency on an organic basis. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.1%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS, of $2.78, grew 9% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Few highlights of business activity this quarter; in our technology business, IQVIA recently entered into a milestone agreement with Alibaba Cloud to collaborate in China. Through this collaboration, IQVIA will be the first company to make its Salesforce-based products available on Alibaba Cloud and the only life sciences provider to have a full Salesforce-based ecosystem of products hosted locally and designed to be compliant with China's data residency and privacy regulations. Through our partnership with Alibaba Cloud and Salesforce, IQVIA will continue to extend the OCE suite, delivering innovative capabilities tailored to meet China's specific market needs. As you know, IQVIA's Human Data Science Cloud offers clients a combination of extensive data networks, data integration, and embedded intelligence, all of which help our clients deal with the challenge of increased data complexity and volume. A top-10 pharma awarded IQVIA our largest ever commercial managed services deal where we will take responsibility for managing the end-to-end commercial analytics for all their commercial brands globally. Personalization of care is becoming a focus of our customers' commercial strategy. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded a major patient support program by a top-10 pharma for their [indiscernible] cardiology product displacing the incumbent vendor. And once again validating IQVIA's uniquely differentiated integrated domain expertise, services, and technology platform. As I previously highlighted, demand from our EBP customers has remained high despite the funding levels returning essentially to pre-pandemic levels. As an example, a U.S. based emerging biopharma company recently selected IQVIA to be their end-to-end clinical to commercial partner. IQVIA was selected due to the breath of capabilities, our domain expertise, strong resources and technology such as OCE. IQVIA will support all aspects of their first commercial launch as well as provide clinical trial services for their future indications. In another example, Biostage which is a biotech company developing regenerative medicine treatment selected IQVIA to manage its first clinical trial of their esophageal implant product. Current treatment options for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer result in only 20% survival at 5 years. In the first use of the implant, the trial demonstrated that the product was able to successfully regenerate tissue to restore the functionality of the esophagus. IQVIA was selected due to our dedicated gastrointestinal team, and our ability and expertise running the most complex cutting-edge cell and gene therapy trials. Within our RNVS, we also signed a long-term collaboration with Clalit, the largest health services provider in Israel to launch the first Prime Site in the region. The collaboration combines IQVIA and Clalit's capabilities in clinical trial delivery, real world research data, and genomics. Clalit operates a network of 14 hospitals and more than 1600 primary care clinics with special expertise in oncology, pediatric rare disease, and genomics. In Oncology, which remains the largest therapeutic area for R&D outsourcing, we continue to experience strong double digit year-over-year growth in bookings. As an example, we expanded one of our preferred partnerships with a top global pharma which awarded IQVIA a large early and late stage trial in multiple oncology indications. We were selected because of our analytics to optimize protocol development, site selection, and operational planning including our ability to recruit patients meeting their diversity targets. So, overall, the R&DS business continues the strong momentum. You saw we achieved new bookings of $3.1 billion in the quarter, the highest in our history. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.51 including pass throughs. And excluding pass throughs, the business delivered almost $2 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.30. For the full-year, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.36 including pass throughs and 1.33 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $739 million grew 2.8% on a reported basis and 7% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $190 million which was down about $150 million versus the fourth quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,499 million, up 0.2% reported and 4.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 7%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2,058 million was up 5.9% reported and 9.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14%. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $182 million declined 7.1% reported, but grew 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was also 2%. For the full-year, revenue was $14,410 million growing at 3.9% on a reported basis and 7.8% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $1 billion for the year. In our base business, again that's excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 13%. For the full-year, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue $5,746 million, up 3.8% reported and 8.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the year. Full-year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7,921 million growing 4.8% reported and 7.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Full-year CSMS revenue was $743 million which was down 5.2% reported, but grew 2.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 4% for the year. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $920 million for the fourth quarter, representing growth of 11.1% while full-year adjusted EBITDA was $3,346 million which was up 10.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $227 million. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20. Full-year GAAP net income was $1,091 million or $5.72 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $524 million in the fourth quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9% to $2.78. For the full-year, adjusted net income was $1,937 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.16. Up 12.5% year-over-year. Now as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarterly booking. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $27.2 billion which was up 9.6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11.6% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Without that impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would have been about $500 million higher. Full-year net new business increased $10.8 billion, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported basis. It increased to $10.8 billion I should say, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported despite a significant amount of COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. Now reviewing the balance sheet, as of December 31, cash and cash equivalence totaled $1,216 million, and gross debt was $12,747 million. And that resulted in net debt of $11,531 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $560 million. And CapEx was $171 million which resulted in a free cash flow of $389 million for the quarter. Now as we shared on our last earnings call, early in the fourth quarter we retired $510 million of variable rate U.S. dollar term loan that was scheduled to mature in early 2024. At the end of the year, we entered into a $1 billion of floating to fixed interest rates swap to further limit our exposure to changes in interest rates. And with these changes, our debt structure at yearend was 66% fixed. And we expect this to drop to about 58% fixed at the end of Q1 when as you know we have $1 billion swap expiring. December 31 marked the end of our Vision 2022 three-year plan and as already mentioned, we exceeded our commitments and here are a few highlights. We achieved a compound average growth rate for revenue of 9.1% reported in 10.2% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. This achievement exceeded the high-end of our goal range of 7% to 10%. Our three-year CAGR for adjusted EBITDA was 11.7%, exceeding our goal of 8% to 11%. And for adjusted diluted earnings per share, the average growth rate was 16.7% consistent with our goal of double-digit growth. Finally, our net leverage ratio exiting 2022 of 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA compared favorably to our goal of 3.5x to 4x. Okay, let's turn now to 2023 guidance. For the full-year 2023, we expect total revenue to be between $15.150 billion and $15.400 billion representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 6.9%. This revenue growth includes about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and a very slight FX tailwind of approximately 10 basis points versus the prior-year. Adjusting for the COVID-related work step-down which we anticipate to be approximately $600 million, the contribution of acquisitions and the FX tailwind, our guidance implies 9% to 11% underlying organic revenue growth at constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, our growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.26 to $10.56 representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 3.9%. Our EPS guidance includes about $615 million of interest expense, just under $550 million of operational D&A and effective income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is about a point higher than it otherwise would have been because of the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. And finally, our EPS guidance assumes an average diluted share count slightly above 190 million shares. Adjusting for the year-over-year impact of the one-time step-up in interest rates and the higher U.K. tax rate, our guidance implies adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 14%. This guidance assumes about $2 billion of cash deployment split evenly between acquisitions and debt retirement and regarding the latter, we expect to retire remaining term debt maturing in March 2024, towards the end of the year; that is the end of '23. Based on these assumptions and our guidance, our net leverage ratio should drop to below three times adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 8th continue for the balance of the year. Now, I know there are a lot of moving pieces in our guidance. So, let me share some additional color on the revenue and adjusted EPS dynamics in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $600 million versus 2022. And I should highlight that about 40% of this step-down will occur in the first quarter. Now, it will more than compensate for this headwind during the course of the year as we project revenue to grow between 9% and 11% organically at constant currency excluding COVID-related work. As I also mentioned previously, our full-year guidance includes about 100 basis points of M&A contribution and a very slight tailwind from foreign exchange of 10 basis points. That said, it's important to point out that we will actually experience a headwind from FX in the first-half. Now at the segment level, we expect revenue growth to be 6% to 8% reported, this includes a year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work underlying organic growth for TAS that is adjusting for the step-down and COVID work, FX and acquisition impacts will be 7% to 9%. R&DS revenue will grow 5% to 7% reported. This reflects an even more significant year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work, underlying organic growth for R&DS, again adjusting for COVID-related work, FX, and acquisition impact will be 10% to 12%. And finally, in CSMS, revenue growth is expected to be flat reported, and approximately two percentage points organic excluding COVID-related work and FX impacts. On adjusted EPS, we will experience the year-over-year impact of the step up in the interest rates and an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate that I mentioned. Together, these non-operational items are expected to impact growth by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. Excluding these items, we expect to deliver strong results with 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. It's important to note that the year-over-year increase in interest expense step up will be most pronounced in the first-half, while the operational tailwind from our cost cutting and productivity initiatives will be skewed towards the second-half of the year. And as these timing issues are relevant to our first quarter guidance, the first quarter will be the toughest comparison versus the prior year primarily due to four factors. Number one, the largest headwind from FX, despite FX being a tailwind for the year; number two, the largest year-over-year COVID-related step-down; third, the toughest interest expense comparison; and finally fourth, the phasing during the year of the benefits of our productivity initiatives which will increase as we progress through the year. So, as a result, in Q1, we expect revenues to be between $3.570 billion and $3.640 billion or growth at 2.4% to 4.3% on a constant currency basis, and 0.1% to 2% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be between 9% and 11%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $835 million and $860 million, which is up 2.8% to 5.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.46, declining 4.9% to 0.4%. Excluding the step up of the interest expense and the tax rate in the U.K., we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 6% and 10% in the first quarter. Again, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates, as of February 8, continue for the balance of the year. So, to summarize, Q4 was another strong quarter capping a successful year. For the full-year, revenue grew 13% organic at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and adjusted EPS was up 13%. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remain healthy, with RFP growth accelerating in Q4 and recording bookings in R&DS. During 2022, we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our shares, and retired $500 million of our variable rate term debt, while reducing our net debt leverage ratio to 3.4 times. We exceeded our Vision 2022 commitments despite the volatile macro environment. And lastly, we're projecting strong operating performance again in 2023, with 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth excluding non-operational headwinds. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Dan Leonard: Thank you. So, I'll just start off, Ari, you mentioned continued confidence in the 2025 goals. You're guiding 5% to 7% of revenue growth in '23. I think the CAGR through '25 was a double-digit number. So, could you bridge from the 2023 result to the acceleration anticipated thereafter? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you very much, Dan. Look, when we say we are on the same trajectory we were on when we set our '25 goals, we -- it continues to be true operationally. Obviously, we assumed foreign currency rates that were different. I think we lost -- I don't know the exact number any longer, but we probably lost $500 million in revenue just in 2022, so -- to FX. So, look, I don't know about revenue; it'll be close. Maybe not 20, but it'll be close. On EBITDA and on earnings per share, we're very confident that we will achieve those goals. Again, the -- what we are facing, first of all, you're seeing the EBTIDA is certainly, clearly on that trajectory unchanged despite everything else. And EPS is just as we said in our introductory remarks, a one-time step up that hopefully won't replicate. If anything, I think the world expects rates to either stabilize or start declining afterwards, in '24 and '25, so that would be even a tailwind. But certainly the step-up is one-time. And after that, we fully expect the resume very strong double-digit as we experienced. I remind you we delivered over 16% compound earnings per share rate of growth rate over the year 2022 period -- three-year period. Thank you.
Dan Leonard: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you. Good morning. So, I wanted to hit on R&DS bookings first. Difficult to ask the question in a way that's easy to answer, but I'd like you to step back and think about your fourth quarter strong bookings, your '22 bookings. Do you have a sense how much was, if you will, normal opportunities versus, say, competitive takeaways, rescue wins, or incremental share capture that you might have gained through higher hit rates through the year? Just trying to get a sense of where the market was versus what IQV did additionally on top of that, if that makes sense.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Yes, well, it's really hard because we don't have the perspective of time and clear data from competitors yet. And we will know a little bit more after we read your report on how CROs did when everyone has reported. So, I'm looking forward to that read. But look, we've been on a momentum certainly since the merger to gain market share. And I think it's clear that we have been gaining market share. We know we are gaining market share because we are displacing competitors. I don't think rescue studies played a role. Of course, we have the anecdotal here and there, but not more or less than in history. And things happen, and the study doesn't go well with a certain approach. And at some point in time, the sponsor decides that they want to switch CROs, it's a very difficult and cumbersome exercise, and no one wants to do that, but it does happen. I don't think it's happened more than in the past, unless you're including rescue studies that were at the beginning and that for a reason or another the sponsor decided to switch CROs. And that I would include in the category of market share gains. The market continues to be strong. The underlying demand, all the indicators that we see, and we kept repeating it ad nauseam during 2022 despite everyone else being on the other side and suggesting that the world was falling apart because of biotech funding levels returning to what I considered to be very strong levels, but nevertheless, lower levels than they were during the pandemic. We haven't seen any delays in decision-making, we haven't seen any signs that demand was slowing down. Quite the opposite, I mentioned that our RFP flow is very strong. I can give you even more -- I've got some more data here on the, if you'd like, the -- our --
Eric Coldwell: Yes. The answer would always be yes, multi-core data.
Ari Bousbib: So, I kind of -- I get that. Yes, the -- again, overall RFP flow was very strong. We said 13% for the full-year, and over 20% in the fourth quarter, so, if anything, accelerating. Our qualified pipeline at the end of the year was up over 20%, and that is really the pipeline that we consider real. The awards, by the way, which is kind of an early indicator of what will happen in the future; awards, I remind you, we stopped at -- we have essentially one, but we have not yet contracted for and not booked for. The awards were up -- actually, the absolute number in Q4 was the highest ever, and it was up 9% year-over-year. So, we mentioned the book-to-bill ratio, the backlog, which itself is up just under 10% year-over-year, and 11.6% excluding FX. So, I don't know what else to share. We've got our solid numbers here that support healthy demand for clinical trial services. And then, on top of that you can add our market share gains, and I think that explains it. Thank you, Eric.
Eric Coldwell: And Ron, if I could just have one quick technical item here, can you confirm that there are no share repurchases built into the guidance? And I know you talked about the $2 billion capital deployment and the split between debt and M&A. But is there any current thinking on taking some advantage of that authorization that you have on the repurchase side?
Ron Bruehlman: I can confirm that there is no share repurchase baked into our guidance. We're right now assuming $2 billion of capital deployment split evenly between M&A and debt reduction. Well, might we repurchase some shares during the year? Sure, that that's our assumption going in, and the guidance that we gave is that we're not. And we'll devote the capital to debt reduction instead. But that could always change with circumstances.
Eric Coldwell: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Anne Samuel with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Anne Samuel with JPMorgan, your line is open.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Justin Bowers: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just pivoting from RDS, Ari, you talked a lot about some strong momentum in commercial managed services. Just want to -- wondering if you could expand about some of the strength there, and also is that isolated just in TAS or is that also in the CTMS business?
Ari Bousbib: You mean CSMS, right, the Contract Sales --?
Justin Bowers: Sorry, the CSMS?
Ari Bousbib: Yes.
Justin Bowers: Yes, that's what I --
Ari Bousbib: No, I mean, CSMS is a relatively slow grower, so I mean I would put that aside. The TAS growth has been consistent. We're pleased, obviously, to see that it continued to grow. You saw that excluding the COVID step down, and we had a fair -- I would say a large share of COVID work during the pandemic, so that's stepping down. And excluding that, we had growth of 7% in Q4, and 10% for the full-year. Quarter-to-quarter it could vary. I think the first-half was more or less around 10% growth, third quarter was 12%, we had the -- activity that was -- that came in earlier than we thought. And the fourth quarter was 7%, so, overall, very good growth in Q4. We guided 7% to 9% for next year. Again, this is consistent -- again excluding COVID acquisitions and FX, this is consistent with the underlying operating momentum that we've had in TAS, and that we've guided to, which is a high single-digit. So, the real -- the fast growers in this business are technology and real-world, and that's where I mentioned a few very significant achievements and a few significant awards with clients. Both considered to be strong drivers of growth as we continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients and deploy more of our technology solutions. The piece of the business that it perhaps more exposed to the economic whims and budget expansions or restrictions by clients is the more discretionary spend, like the analytics and the consulting work. We saw, usually at the end, almost -- just to share a little bit more color, we usually have at the end of the year an acceleration in this business, and we didn't see that in December. And the reason for that is, historically, clients like to spend more towards the end of the year, and they do kind of last-minute purchases, and they kind of utilize their budgets, if you will. And we didn't see that so much this year. And I -- again, I don't know whether people are kind of being more cautious or anything, but -- and mostly, again, it was in the consulting area and analytics, which tends to be short cycle, short-term, and more discretionary. But the underlying growth is driven by real-world and technology, both of which are longer-term decisions and are not so subject to cyclical economic changes. And then, of course, the last piece is the data business, which is flat and continues flat to low single digits, one-ish percent, and that continues where it is. And when you do the math, basically that's what yields your high single-digit growth for the segment. Thank you for your question.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Ari, so, I know you sound bullish around the funding trend that you've seen over the last year. Wanted to ask about funding in a different way, just what were you seeing in terms of cancellations around your end? Was there anything notable about that relative to the last couple of years?
Ari Bousbib: Nothing.
Jack Meehan: Short and sweet. Yes, has there been any rumbling around restructuring at any of your important clients? I guess just like how are you building just sort of a macro into your outlook for the R&D segment this year?
Ari Bousbib: Okay, and once again in terms of demand, no signs that we can see that our clients are somehow delaying, canceling, postponing clinical trial development work that was planned before. So, we don't see anything, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual postponements, nothing. We've been saying this essentially for 12 months exactly. In terms of factoring the macro environment, if you want to expand your question, then that's a different discussion. We've got -- we are a large, powerful ship navigating extremely stormy waters. The engine continues to be very strong, that's the demand, and certainly our operating momentum in our organization. But the winds in the form of interest expense, in the form of wage inflation, in the form of wars in foreign theaters that affect our ability to do work in certain sides, in the form of continued COVID issues in China which are expected to delay our return to normal operating mode in clinical sites; all of those and more are these winds that I'm -- winds and stormy waters that I'm referring to that are macro factors. Some of which we can do something about. For example, wage inflation we are addressing by trying to manage our workforce more tightly, by increasing and accelerating our productivity initiatives, by looking at maintaining and accelerating our cost cutting discipline. And we've launched that effect that towards the end of last year, a new program to again bring forward many field overhead rationalizations and economies of scope and outsourcing and offshoring decisions that were scheduled to occur over the '22 to '25 planning period and we are accelerating all of that into 2023. So, as Ron mentioned, the benefits of those will begin showing towards the latter part of the year, but the work is ongoing. So, that's how we are trying to address those macro factors that are not -- that are somehow that we can offset with action on our side. With respect to interest, shortest one-time step-up in the interest expense, we're kind of limited in what we can do. But we certainly, as you saw started reducing our debt levels, and we entered into swaps. We're trying to address that in capital markets, we will probably towards the end of the year retire another $1 billion of debt, the tranche that would normally turnout in 2024. We'll do that in the latter part of the year. And for now, as Eric remind us we do not have any share repurchase plan this year, because we're diverting our cash flow now, if our cash flow is very strong and circumstances were to change, obviously, we will adjust those decisions. But that's what we're doing to address the macro factor. Thank you very much.
Jack Meehan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.
Luke Sergott: Hey guys, thanks. Can you one clean-up here on the COVID, can you give us a sense of the how you're expecting that the roll-off in 1Q between the two segment between TAS and RDS, just from a modeling perspective?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, Jack, it's I think I'd said overall of the $600 million COVID step-down year-over-year, about 40% of it would be in Q1, though, will be fairly substantial impacts in both of the segments there. And I would say about a third of the impact would be in TAS, [Jack] [Ph], and about two-thirds in R&D, that's kind of how you should think about it by quarter and for the full-year, it's above that roughly.
Luke Sergott: All right, great. Thanks. It's really helpful. And lastly, here on front on the free cash flow. So, I mean, I understand a ton of moving parts here on for the year. But can you give us a sense of what you're targeting for '23 and as a percentage of EBITDA conversion?
Ari Bousbib: We always talked about it as a percentage of adjusted net income. And we target typically between 80% and 90% free cash flow adjusted net income, that's where we were for the full-year 2022. And look the only thing I would caution on that is in any given year, it could vary from that because cash flow is based on point-to-point of the balance sheet. It's not like, an accrual concept or anything like that. So, of course, you could be higher or lower, we were substantially higher than that in 2021. And we're right in the range in 2022. And I would say just as a kind of a target you should think of as being in the 80% to 90% of adjusted net income range, but recognizing that we could deviate from that in any given year.
Luke Sergott: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sandy Draper with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Sandy Draper: Thanks very much. Question for you, Ari to sort of engage in your crystal ball a little bit longer-term because I know you're talking certainly a lot more of the biopharma CEOs and than I am, when I look back at sort of what I heard at JPMorgan, Davos, just other things around, how pharma is looking at the next three to five even 10 years, especially with the Inflation Reduction Act, I hear sort of conflicting messages from about are people going to invest more, hey, we want to get away from or be more diversified and not so concentrated in one or two blockbuster drugs and so we want to get more drugs out there. We are going to and so there is more trials we're going to pull back, I just love to hear what you're hearing or what you're thinking about what your customers are looking at not really, from the economic perspective about the current macro environment, but with how their portfolios are, how concentrated they are and few really big drugs, and what the Inflation Reduction Act means. Would love to hear your thoughts on that? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you. Yes, I mean look, the Inflation Reduction Act of just similar to, what they decided to name it. It's very is influx right now, there's a lot of work to be done in finalizing the details of the legislation; we actually spend a lot of time with our clients trying to explain to them what's in it. Not that we understand it entirely, because many of the provisions, first of all, haven't been detailed enough or specific enough. And we don't know how it's going to work. And a lot of it is still subject to negotiations. Many of the provisions anyway, won't kick in until later in the decade, and again, some parts of the inflations are undefined, many of the rules and regulations are still under discussion. So, generally, the statements from pharma CEOs, when I speak to them about this is that, it's harmful to innovation and to patients because anytime you start curbing the economics or you try to start a curbing the economics for drug development, even if it's long-term and even if it's the effect, if any, before any other administration changes these things, it'll be seen 15 years from now, it could at least conceptually, the pharma companies to decide, well, it's not as attractive, so I'm going to drop this program or that program, when I factor in different types of pricing and so on, so forth, or reimbursements. But again this is not how pharma works. Despite the [indiscernible] pharma is motivated by healing people. And the R&D, all of the R&D Heads at Pharma companies that I know and my colleagues speak to day in and day out, their motivation, what makes them come to work every day is they are going to come up with a drug to cure pancreatic cancer and to cure breast cancer and to cure diabetes, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is the underlying motivation. And the model is predicated on pharmaceuticals doing good for society. So, the notion that people are going to cancel the program, because the economic zone gets attractive, yes at the margins. That's a general observation. Second observation in my conversations with clients is that a lot of and that's a trend that that's independent of the Inflation Reduction Act, a lot of the focus is on trying to address more specific diseases, rare diseases, subcategories within subcategories in oncology, I mentioned before oncology is probably and it continues to be the largest and strongest grower in our business in terms of the demand for clinical trials, and drug development work. So, that's just not going away until the diseases go away, which we all hope for, drug development is here to stay. And pretty much in the same model. Again, the focus on addressing previously untouched obviously is much smaller markets. That continues, and that as you know plays to our strength and capability. So, I mean, that's the bit of color on my conversation. So, yes, I mean it's a general cloud and at a conference like Davos, you could expect to hear such things. But in practice that is not changing very much day-to-day how our plants operate and make decisions with respect to their investment programs. Thank you.
Sandy Draper: Got it. Thanks, Ari.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on sort of the degree of pricing that you're sort of getting on new contracts and that are going into bookings and also sort of the degree of wage inflation you're currently experiencing as your labor force. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, I will take the second part of the question first, yes, we are experiencing significant wage inflation, the skill sets that we are looking for are scarce and in high demand, we're looking for people who have healthcare expertise, who have data science expertise, who have software development expertise, or a combination of all three, and that these skills are in very high demand. Secondly, frankly, we are a hunting ground for competitors of all kinds in the healthcare sector, in the tech sector, and in the data science sector. And as a result, we are compelled to raise our compensation programs, and that causes inflation. So, you have the general inflation out there, plus reasons there are specific idiosyncratic to our business and to our company. Now, I mentioned before that, despite that, you can see that we are growing our margins. So, we are addressing it, and that's true, essentially cost management programs meaning, we do more work in lower cost areas, et cetera. Now, I get into the first part of your question, which is pricing, are we able to offset those costs increases with pricing generally, in the commercial sector for shorter cycle businesses? Theoretically, yes, and we are when we can, but it's always a negotiation with clients. And it's a competitive market out there, you got a lot of smaller competitors who are fighting for the slice of the pie. And often, we got to defend against that. And so, our pricing flexibility is limited, it does exist in theory on the commercial side. In R&D, as in for clinical trials, yes, of course, rates have to reflect what the labor cost is. And again, that's also subject to negotiation. But we do transfer at least a portion of those wage raises to our clients in the form of rates that are applied to determine pricing for a clinical trial. But I remind you that the clinical trial business is a long-term, long cycle business, meaning that what we booked today, which may reflect some level of price increase, won't be realized into revenues until the next, the one to four or five years. So, what we are delivering in revenue today, and tomorrow was sold several years ago at different, under different labor cost assumptions. So, there is a delay, if you will, in the clinical trial business, because of the long cycle nature of the business. There are contracts where we have escalation clauses for inflation, but they never envisioned the type of inflation that we are facing in some of the markets. So, that's the picture on pricing. Thank you very much, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Anderson: That's very helpful. Thank you, sir.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Nick Childs: One more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe Ron, just I might have missed it, but when you talk about the impact EPS from these buckets, can you kind of break down for us the relative contribution between the higher tax rate, interest expense, et cetera, that makes up sort of that delta on EPS growth and then if you think about for this year, yes, for the EPS?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, well look the U.K. corporate tax rate increase, added about a percentage point to our overall effective tax rate. So, you start with that, but most of the impact year-over-year is coming from interest expense. So, we were, I think slightly over $400 million in interest expense in 2022. We told you about $615 million in 2023. So, you can do the math on that, then with 190 -- roughly 190 million shares and figure out what the impact is, it's principally coming out of that and that's why we excluded those two items and showed you that absent those are EPS growth rate underlying operational was still very strong double-digit.
Charles Rhyee: And that assumes the debt pay down assumptions and going into swap agreements or is that, if you do those things through the course of the year, okay?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, all of that is baked into our assumptions.
Charles Rhyee: All right, great.
Nick Childs: Thank you.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Childs.
Nick Childs: Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call. Myself and the team will be available the rest of the day for any follow-up questions you might have.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I’d now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations who has succeeded Brian [ph]. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s business, which are discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong financial results despite market concerns about slowing demand, broader macroeconomic challenges and the various global geopolitical issues. In fact, indicators of demand both from customers and in the market generally remain healthy. Industry clinical trials starts continue to trend ahead of last year, rising almost 7% year-to-date. The pipeline of active early stage and late stage molecules are both up 8% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. EBP funding, which has been a lingering concern since the beginning of the year when one of our smaller competitors raised alarms. EBP funding improved in fact, in the quarter, according to Bio World, third quarter funding was $18.7 billion, the highest of any quarter this year. Year to date, funding is running at about a $60 billion annual rate, which exceeds the average of the last five years pre-COVID. Our own RFP flow grew mid-teens in Q3 and RFP flow in both the large pharma and EBP segments are up double digits on a year-to-date basis. Our Q3 book-to-bill was 1.39 excluding pass throughs and 1.27 including pass throughs, continuing our strong results from the first half of the year. And as a result, as you saw, our backlog grew 5.4% versus prior year on a reported basis and 9.4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange. As you can tell, we are not experiencing any signs of slowdown in demand. It also helps that we are extremely diversified. Remember, we serve over 10,000 customers in more than a 100 countries, including all top 25 large pharma clients across the spectrum of therapeutic areas. Now, while demand remains very healthy, as you know, and as we have been saying throughout the year, we have been dealing with operational challenges caused by the global macro environment including wage inflation, high levels of attrition, obviously the ongoing Russia-Ukraine disruptions, reoccurring China lockdowns that are still going on and perhaps that's a newer development, some staff shortages at certain investigator sites. As you know, we have been able to overcome all these issues as reflected in our results for the first nine months of the year. Although as we end the year, we are anticipating some minor delays in the timing of deliveries caused by this macro-disruptions and specifically by the bottlenecks that are created by staff shortages at certain sites and that are delaying the execution of our deliveries. This is why we decided to tweak the guidance a little in the final stretch to the end of the year. A notes on our capital location strategy, as a result of persistent high levels of inflation. Interest rates have been increasing sharply. In response, we're adjusting our capital allocation strategy to include some debt pay down, in addition to M&A and share repurchase opportunistically as in the past. In summary, the underlying demand in the industry and in our businesses remained strong and we are managing through the headwinds caused by the factors I just discussed. Now, let's review the third quarter in more detail. Revenue for the third quarter grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. The $22 million beat above the meat point of our guidance range was driven by operational upside in both TAS and R&DS services, offset by continued foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 14% at constant currency on an organic basis. Notably on the same basis the R&DS business was up 18% and TAS was up 12%. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline, offsetting the headwinds of wage inflation that are persisting in our business. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.48 grew 14.3% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Let me provide some color on the business, starting with the commercial and technology side. The exponential increase in industry data access and complexity has created tremendous new opportunities for inside and evidence generation. When making this data usable requires robust information management capabilities and as you know, at IQVIA, we've been building these capabilities for decades. In the call, the top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA's human data science cloud to power large scale data and analytics programs by centralizing and harmonizing data for 35 large countries across their primary care and specialty medicine portfolio. We continue to advance digital marketing in healthcare. We're deploying a privacy-first open ecosystem that delivers healthcare information in a timely and personalized manner to meet the fast changing needs of the healthcare consumer. In the quarter, IQVIA acquired Lasso Marketing, which developed an operating system that's purpose built for healthcare marketers to coordinate and execute omnichannel digital campaigns from a single platform. In addition, DMD Marketing Solutions, which you will recall, we acquired about a year ago, was recently selected by a top 10 pharma client to bring to market 3 oncology and biological brands using digital insights to deliver personalized brand content to HCPs that are relevant to their practices and interest. Demand for our commercial technology solutions remained strong. This quarter, the top 20 pharma clients selected IQVIA's commercial technology ecosystem suite to transform its commercial operations into an AI-enabled commercial model. The customer will deploy IQVIA's orchestrated customer engagement suite, IQVIA's master data management and orchestrated analytics in more than 30 countries, driving a 20% efficiency gain in customer coverage and boosting the speed and precision of their older management process. In the real-world business, IQVIA continues to lead in innovative study design that combine multiple IQVIA capabilities. For example, in the quarter, we were awarded a multiyear portfolio of real-world studies in psychiatry from a midsized pharma company. We are combining faster data-driven recruitment time lines with a comprehensive home health infrastructure to reduce the burden on both the patients and the site. In another example, we were awarded a significant contract with a major med tech company to identify early markers for organ transplant rejection to a non-interventional study that combines our med tech, real-world and translational sciences capabilities. Moving to RDS. Our decentralized clinical trial, DCT program, has received independent compliance validation from EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, from Trust Arc, which is the leader in GDPR validation. This is a big deal. This program is highly recognized in the industry as it requires 2 separate independent audits. It's a key achievement for IQVIA as it is the first time any DCT offering has received this European data privacy validation. In addition, we've now expanded our DCT capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso Inc., a leader in clinical grade blood collection solutions. Participants in clinical trials can now provide a blood specimen for lab testing in the comfort of their own home without the need to visit an investigator site or have a health care professional visit them, expanding our DCT offerings and capabilities. And of course, as you've seen, the overall R&DS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 excluding pass-throughs. And including pass-throughs, the business delivered over $2.5 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27. Over the last 12 months, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.35, excluding pass-throughs, and 1.29, including pass-throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.562 billion grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $220 million, down about $160 million versus the third quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.4 billion, up 4.7% reported and 11.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 12%. R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1.979 billion was up 6.8% reported and 10.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 18%, as Ari mentioned. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS third quarter revenue of $183 million declined 9% reported but grew 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 3%. Year-to-date revenue was $1.671 billion grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 8.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were about $850 million year-to-date. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4.247 billion, up 5.2% reported and 10.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech & Analytics Solutions was 11%. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $5.863 billion was up 4.5% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. But excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19% year-to-date. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS year-to-date revenue of $561 million declined 4.6% reported and grew 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 5%. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $814 million for the third quarter, representing growth of 11.8% while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,426 million up 10.6% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $283 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.49. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $864 million or $4.52 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $470 million for the third quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.3% to $2.48 and year-to-date adjusted net income was $1,413 million or $7.39 per share. Now it's already reviewed, R&D solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of bookings. Our backlog at September 30 stood at a record $25.8 billion, an increase of 5.4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9.4% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. In fact, I might point out that without the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would be $900 million higher. Next 12 month revenue from backlog increased to $7.1 billion, growing 2.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6.7% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Okay, now reviewing the balance sheet, as of September 30, cash and cash equivalence totalled $1,274 million and gross debt was $12,394 million resulting in net debt of $11,120 million. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.42 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $863 million and CapEx was $165 million resulting in a strong free cash flow result of $698 million for the quarter. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased 150 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase. It's slightly above $1.1 billion and this leaves us with just under $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now, as was already discussed earlier, we're adjusting our cash deployment strategy in the light of higher interest rates. Earlier this month, we retired $510 million of variable rate US dollar term loans scheduled to mature early in 2024, and this was in October, so you don't see it in our end of September balance sheet. We will likely retire additional term debt during 2023 while we continue to pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares, as has been our practice since the merger. Now let's turn now to guidance. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency in the low-to-mid teens. On a reported basis the strengthening of the US dollar has caused over $500 million of full year headwind since our initial guidance last November, and this $500 million includes a further impact since our second quarter earnings release. In addition, as already mentioned, global macro environment challenges such as wage inflation, investigator staff shortages, slower than expected recovery of patient visits, continued lockdowns in China and the still unresolved Russia-Ukraine conflict are persisting and so far, we've been able to offset all these challenges and absorb them in our numbers, but we're forecasting a modest residual impact in pockets of our business during the balance of the year, and we reflected this in the updated values. So for the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,325 million and $14,425 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an adjustment of about a $100 million dollars with roughly two-thirds of this driven by foreign exchange impact and the rest by the global macro environment headwinds I just detailed. Our updated guidance represents year-over-year growth 7.4% to 8.2% at constant currency and 3.2% to 4% on a reported basis. And as a reminder, this equates the low-to-mid teens organic growth at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our projected revenue growth includes approximately 200 basis points of contribution from M&A. We're also updating our guidance on adjusted EBITDA to reflect the revenue and cost end wins mention. We're now expecting the guidance range to be between -- we are now setting the guidance range to be between $3,330 million and $3,360 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 11.2%. And lastly, we're raising the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA EPS guidance by $0.05 to reflect updated estimates of costs below the adjusted EBITDA line. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $10.10 and $10.20, which represents year-over-year growth of 11.8% to 13%. Moving to our fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be between $3,654 million and $3,754 million or growth of 5.5% to 8.2% on a constant currency basis, and 0.5% to 3.2% on a reported basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be over 10% at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $904 million and $934 million. That's up 9.2% to 12.8% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.72 and $2.82 growing 6.7% to 10.6%. Now, all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 24 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize before we go to Q&A, the underlying demand in the industry and our business remained very healthy. We delivered strong operational P&L and free cash flow performance in the quarter. Revenue grew mid-teens organically at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our RDS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. Contracted backlog sits at a new record of $25.8 billion up over 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We repurchase nearly $150 million of our shares while reducing our net leverage ratio to approximately 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjust EBITDA and finally, we retired at the beginning of the fourth quarter, $510 million of our variable term debt. With that, let me hand it over to the operator to start the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
Dave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on kind of speed of throughput in RDS. I call it speed of studies and thinking about major buckets that could fall both on the accelerator side and the decelerator side. So you talked about your DCT capabilities, more remote activity that could spur along throughput or recruitment of patients, finding patients that are willing to participate in studies. Maybe, clients that post-COVID are kind of pushing hard to catch up for things that were pushed behind during COVID. And then on the other side, these things that you've highlighted around staff shortages at sites things like that, maybe therapeutic mix in your backlog might be lengthening. That's something that's a trend in the industry. So just seems like, relevant to how quickly you can convert your backlog into revenue or these factors and I wondered, Ari, if you could kind of help us understand the tug of war there and which one's winning?
Ari Bousbib: Well good morning, David. Thank you for the question and there are many elements of response built in your question itself. You clearly know the industry and what's happening very well. Look as a context as you all know in the field, patient visits have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. So that's point number one. I think it was presented at an industry conference recently. I think it was on October 7 Society for Clinical Research Sites Summit, this issue of staff shortages that are affecting investor side operations was flagged as a development industry-wide. So that, if you will, is on the negative now. You're correct to point to DCT has obviously -- the less we require the patient to actually visit the site, the better it is as a counter to this issue. Now we don't see this issue as a sort of permanent or ongoing thing. It happens to be that what we have been dealing with, and we've been talking about from the beginning of the year, which is very high levels of attrition, people have a hard time going back to work. We have a harder time recruiting the skill sets that we require plus the impact on cost of labor that all of that has, all of these factors in combination are a significant -- or the single most important operational challenge we have seen. And as we've mentioned many times, we've been dealing with that and offsetting the impact of these issues with our productivity initiatives and cost-reduction programs. Now we're not the only ones to experience these staff shortages. The sites also have staff shortages as a result of the same factors. And when they have to prioritize dealing with the incoming flow of patients versus dealing with clinical trials. And so that's a development. You mentioned also the complexity of studies as new factors. And I think this is also correct. There is -- the mix, not just in our backlog, I think it's industry-wide that happens to be the evolution of the market, the mix of studies makes it -- makes the factors I just mentioned, even more acute. As you know, recruitment of patients is much more -- is correlated. The difficulty to recruit patient is correlated with the complexity of the study. Now this is an area where we can shine because we've got our data analytics and our technology, and we've proven many times that we are able to address complex studies and recruit patients better than we would have had otherwise. So which side is going to win, it's hard to tell. But look, so far, I mean, through the year, we've been able to address all of those. I mean you've seen our numbers every quarter we have been able to beat our own expectations, and that's because we've been able to address it. We have a very diversified, large-scale company, and we are able to adjust. We're not dependent on one single study. Had we been 1/10 of the size, we would be highly sensitive to a big study win or a big study loss. We're not. We just tweaked a little bit the fourth quarter numbers here just because we want to make sure we anticipate everything and be transparent and put this out to investors. Thank you for your question, Dave.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer with UBS.
John Sourbeer: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more on the inflation and hiring trends. And you also mentioned some attrition in the prepared remarks. Just how do you see this playing out into next year? I know you're not guiding on 2023, but do you see some easing on the trends there? And then on the other side, I guess, how is pricing looking? And are you able to offset any of these pricing -- these inflationary pressures on pricing?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, John, and a very good question. That is exactly the operational equation that we are dealing with. And again, there's no news here. We've been talking about this throughout the year. We've been saying this is a single most significant operational challenge we're dealing with is talent, talent, talent. And the cost of the talent, recruiting, training, retaining and compensating the talent that we need to execute our studies. The levels of attrition reached record highs. I mean, you're talking about almost 20% sometime in the first part of the year. We have seen those levels of attrition come down and stabilized. Now they're still very high. It's now more in the 16%, 17% type of range and is stabilized there. And we hope that they are going to continue to come down. Obviously, we put in place a very large number of measures to retain people. And those include, not only but they include the compensation -- upward compensation adjustments, which again, places more burden and more -- and create inflation that we have to deal with. This is, as I just mentioned before, the sales issue industry-wide and including at our partner sites where we execute the studies, which is creating the bottlenecks that we talked about for us to execute. So as far as our operations, we don't know how long this attrition issues and employee turnover and headwinds will last. We are dealing with them. I can tell you that many of the cost-cutting and productivity initiative programs that we were planning to launch in '23, we have decided to accelerate and we're starting many of them in this fourth quarter of 2022 in anticipation of potential continuation of some of these employee turnover and wage inflation issues. So we are going to address that as far as our operations. Now you asked the balancing question, which is how are we able to reflect that on pricing. As you know, on the CRO side of the house, it's a long-cycle business. So the contracted backlog that was contracted a year or 2 years, 3 years, 4 years ago, that's still in our backlog sometimes, that is at a certain cost assumptions, which were different than the ones we are facing. There are, in most contracts, cost escalation provisions and clauses that enable us to adjust the rates. But I don't think anyone anticipated 8%, 9% inflation. So we're not fully able to immediately -- there is a delay, if you will, there is a lag between when we are suffering the cost headwind and when we can reflect that into our pricing. Now it's a little less like that in the shorter cycle businesses on the commercial side. But there also we have long-term contracts. We have at least 1 year, 2-year contracts. We've got technology licenses at certain rates. We've got data contracts at certain rates. So it is more likely that we are able to reflect price increases in analytics, in consulting, in services, which are 3, 6 months, 1 year visibility-type contracts and those were able to -- but again, it's not the bulk of the business. So it will happen, and we've got plans to do so, but there is a lag. Thank you, John, for your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper with Guggenheim.
Sandy Draper: Thanks very much. I guess, Ari, it'd be helpful to hear some commentary on the TAS side and thinking about the 3 broad buckets you look at TAS. In terms of the demand drivers there, are there -- what do you feel like is improving, staying the same, potentially weakening? Just thinking about some of the commentary or concerns out there around okay, what's happening with the sales force? Is that going to be accelerating in terms of cuts? Has that stabilized, thinking about overall marketing budgets how people are looking at using data and marketing. Just would love some commentary about how you see what's going on in terms of pros and cons and puts and takes on the TAS side as we head into next year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, Sandy, and thank you for the question. Look, we are very pleased with the continued strong growth that we are seeing in TAS. You heard us, both Ron and myself, report organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID from both years of 12%. That's really, really strong. And you know that the -- if we think about the business in three buckets and the high-growth bucket includes real world and commercial tech and they continue to be strong drivers of growth. We continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients, as I described in my introductory remarks, and we care to deploy more of our technology solutions. You talked about digital marketing. So it's true that sales forces, sales reps as a demographic in general, are going down. And so any parts of any business that are reliant on physical interactions between sales reps and physicians, those businesses clearly have a downward long-term trends. So people who are dependent on CRM, for example, are going to experience headwinds. Now as I have mentioned many times before, we have been long ago at the forefront of the transition to digital marketing. Interactions with HCPs are now rapidly evolving towards digital interactions. And I mentioned in my introductory remarks, some examples, we made investments in this area. We bought DMD Marketing last year. We bought Lasso this past quarter. These are unique, this is kind of an operating system that enables pharma clients to buy and decide where to place promotional content. This is where the industry is going. We've made investments. We bought technology and companies that we feel are unique and will enable us to claim our fair share of that market. And we are here to support our clients in this transition. So you're absolutely correct. Overall, the traditional mode of going to market is going away. It's a slow trend downwards, but it is downward, but it is more than offset by growth in digital marketing, and that's what we've been investing in, and that's what's growing in our business. Thank you, Sandy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: This one is actually for Ron. Given the rise in interest rates and your focus on retiring more debt, can you give us a little bit of color as to how we should be thinking of the blended interest rate that we should assume on debt? And are you targeting kind of a leverage ratio instead of the mid-3s, low-3s, like how should we be thinking about this just more of an ongoing basis?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Shlomo. And it's very topical given the interest rate environment these days. And we haven't provided comprehensive P&L guidance for 2023 at this point. But it's an important enough issue. I want to give you a little bit of color around that in addition to what our strategies are to deal with it. Let's start with the strategies. You saw that we paid down debt in the fourth quarter with a term loan that was coming to $510 million in -- early in 2024 and comparatively expensive, and we'll be looking to pay down some additional term loan debt that near term in maturity as we go through next year. So you'll see us talking about that. As far as our leverage ratio, we have -- that's been gradually trending downward. It was at 3.4 as we exited Q3. I would expect that as we go through next year, we'll hit that or get close to any way that 3 target that we set for the end of 2025. I think we're going to get down to that level sooner rather than later and possibly by the end of next year. Now as far as interest expense goes, look, we're not in the business of forecasting rates. So it's precisely forecasting interest expense depends on what you think is going to happen with rates, but we can give you some help. If we just look at where the market consensus for rates is and kind of project outward from that, we think that in Q4, interest expense will be about $130 million, give or take. And you see that's a fairly substantial step-up from where it has been. And actually, the run rate exiting the year at the very end of the quarter, will be about $140 million per quarter. And if you extend that out, you don't have to be a math major to say it's $560 million is kind of an annual rate exiting the year. And if there are further increases, modest increases in rates as we go into the first quarter, which was what the market is projecting, we'll see then -- then that number could go higher. We also have a swap rolling off at the end of Q3. So you could see interest expense next year getting higher than $560 million, maybe approaching $600 million. We'll see. But you have to keep in mind that this depends on a lot of things. It depends on central rate actions, our cash flow, how we choose to use our cash flow next year and so forth. But this should get you in the ballpark anyway for your models. I know some people have been struggling with that. So I wanted to be a little bit more explicit than we had been in the past when we said count on like $16 million for each 0.25 point of interest in drive, right?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So I mean, that's the item that we've been working on. And as Ron mentioned, we decided that it was time to retire some of the debt that matures in '24. So we took out 5 10 in just a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago. And we're probably going to retire what is maturing in '24. We will retire that in '23. And so we will begin addressing the issue of interest expense. Of course, it's a 1-year issue right? From a comparison standpoint, we likely will have a step-up in interest expense in aggregate for us in '23 versus '22. But from then on, hopefully, rates are going to either stabilize or decrease. If you look at the forecast by the individual governance of the Fed, and you've got these charts with every dots representing each governor's anticipation of rates and they are really all over the map. For 2024, ranging from 2.5% to 5%. So hopefully, at some point, the rates will go down and then it becomes a tailwind, so to speak. But certainly, going to '23, it will be a headwind that we have to address, and we're planning to address and take other actions on other fronts to mitigate that impact.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: Just wanted to follow up on the comments around labor. And with -- we're seeing obviously some turnover in -- or some changes in the Bay Area and then some of your clients as well. So I wanted to get a sense of if the labor pressures that you're seeing are isolated in any specific pockets or geographies? And if some of the turnover we're seeing and those other areas provide you an opportunity to either hire talent, notably in TAS or just combat some of the inflation? And then the follow-up to that would be with some of the labor issues at the sites, is there a way to provide us some goal pulse on what the backlog conversion would be over the next 12 months in light of what you're seeing at the site level?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you very much for your question. Look, given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for TAS. That's number one. That's in addition to the overall context of post-COVID resignations and the inflation that drives an additional component of wage inflation. Now we are actively recruiting and hiring, I mean, thousands of people, the numbers are staggering, the number of people we bring on board in order to meet the incremental demand. And of course, we've had this attrition issue that I mentioned earlier. We have approximately 83,000 employees. We recruit, as I said, thousands and thousands of employees a year. So we do have the capabilities we are focused on it. Now where? Which pockets? Obviously, it's CRAs, its operational people, it's project leadership. It's really front-line execution field skilled professionals. And that's where the issues are. Now because of that, we're seeing margin pressure from the labor cost increases. And -- but you've seen we've expanded our margins. So really, that's because of our productivity initiatives. We do intend to continue this trend. We are not just sitting here and watching the headwinds, we are countering them, and you know that we've done that throughout the year. Now we are -- we made a minus modest adjustment to reflect some labor cost increase that we're not able to offset entirely in the fourth quarter, again, very minor just because there is a lag. You recruit highly skilled and expensive people. It takes a little bit of time before they are actually deployed in the field and productive. And sometimes, you just don't have the time to catch up with the cost reduction programs to offset those increases in costs. Now with respect to the staff shortage at other sites, we don't manage those sites, and it's hard to do the same thing there. I do not, at this point in time, see that these trends are widespread or that they are going to continue in such a way that all of a sudden, the long-term conversion of our backlog is compromised. We do not see that because those staff shortages have been located in pockets. We are operating in a lot of sites and not all of them are experienced globally. And it's mostly some sites -- mostly the sites that have been affected are in the U.S. where we see most of the pressure. Frankly, some of the reasons we've had to make the little -- very modest residual adjustments we made to our fourth quarter numbers is a lot of it is due to the lab business not being able -- not receiving the flow of samples from the sites on the time line that they had been -- that they had expected them. And the reason for that is because there were less patient visits at the site. They were less patient visits at the sites because there was less staff to handle the patients. And so that's what created the bottleneck. And we know it's a specific site. So it's too early for me to say this is a widespread permanent change in the industry. Yes, the studies are more complex and that results into slower conversion by definition, but that was occurring even before COVID and it's not going to be a major step down and [indiscernible]. So, so far, we cannot say that this is going to continue. We think that we'll be able to deal with it in the early part of 2023.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Ron, maybe one for you in a similar vein there. You talked about the interest expense, obviously, jumping up with the variable next year. I guess when you think about the different inputs, Ari, you touched on labor costs there as well. When you think about the ability to offset some of that down the P&L, can you just talk about, I guess, the margin structure for next year? Again, you have some of the inflationary pressures. You talked a little bit about pricing throughout the call. But I guess, how do you think about the P&L defensiveness, ability to insulate away from some of that interest expense jumping up on you guys as you get into next year?
Ron Bruehlman: Look, the interest expense is going to be pretty much what it is, and it's going to be based upon rate increases and so forth. And we'll do what we talked about in terms of debt reduction. And really what you're looking for is what can we do up above the EBITDA line and above to offset some of the items below, like interest spend, below the line that we have less control over in the short term. And we see our demand environment, as we laid out today, is fundamentally being very healthy. Yes, we highlighted a few executional challenges due to macro factors, but we don't see them as being permanent. And we see the outlook for next year without getting into guidance for 2023. Obviously, at this point, it's being fundamentally strong on an operating basis. Nothing has changed there. We're going to try to continue to drive cost reduction to offset not just what Ari said about the continued labor pressures, which hopefully will abate, but we can't count on that. But also to help offset some of what we see below the line in interest expense. And we'll be coming out with guidance in the February time frame and lay it all out for you then.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. And again, that's absolutely -- you're absolutely correct, Patrick. We are exactly working on this. I mentioned earlier that we have plans. You will recall when we gave our 20 by '25 targets, which, by the way, are unchanged. Nothing here is, in the slightest, making us deviate from the goals we've set for 2025 for our company, at least with the exception perhaps of the leverage ratio we were targeting 2025 at a leverage ratio of 3. And as Ron mentioned, it's likely will be at 3 well before that. But other than that, our goals are the same. The road to those goals may not always necessarily be a straight line, but the growth haven't changed. Now in support of these goals, we had over the next 3 years, a series of programs and productivity initiatives internally, and we've decided in light of both the increased below-the-line headwinds for '23 and a continued labor inflation, which we are assuming as a given, we decided to accelerate the programs we were supposed to initiate in '23, and we are initiating them in the fourth quarter of '22. So the answer to your question is absolutely yes, and that's the plan.
Operator: Your final question comes from Elizabeth -- from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: So Ron, a quick one for you. You guys had a big cash quarter. Can you talk about the drivers here? You brought your conversion up to 85%, which is kind of where you guys were targeting, I guess, your long-term range. So is this a good spot to think about the jump off?
Ron Bruehlman: I'm not sure what you mean by the jump off, but...
Luke Sergott: For '23, sorry.
Ron Bruehlman: Well, look, I think in any given year, we targeted 80% to 90% of adjusted net income for cash flow. But cash flow is inherently volatile. So 1 year, it may be a lot better, 1 year it may be a little bit less. And certainly, from quarter-to-quarter, you see that to a much greater degree. And we had a not so great second quarter and a much better third quarter. And the reason is pretty simple, our collection -- timing of collections, it was just much better in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. And nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our cash flow. We're going to continue driving towards maximizing cash flow, trying to minimize our day sales outstanding and remain a strong cash generator. My only comment there is don't put too much weight on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that's the nature of cash flow. It's not like earnings, it's not accrual-based. So it tends to be more volatile and more difficult to predict on a short-term basis.
Luke Sergott: All right. And then lastly here, I'll leave the staffing shortage question for offline. But can you talk a little bit more about the color of the bookings? Any change in the duration or the size of the average win that you guys are seeing? Anything that would portend on an acceleration or deceleration in an overall project quality and in size?
Ari Bousbib: Absolutely nothing changed at all, okay? Overall, RFP flow is 10% up year-to-date, 15% in Q3. What we call the qualified pipeline, which means it's advanced, it's not early stage, it's not speculative, is up 19% year-over-year. Awards in Q3, the awards are -- should I mention the number? The awards in Q3 are 22% up, second highest quarter ever. Plus 10% sequential growth. I mean, I don't know what else to tell you. I'm looking at every number possible. On the demand side, we see no change. It's widespread, large pharma, EBP. We've been saying this for the -- from the beginning of the year. You guys are not believing us, but the numbers are showing, are -- and I guess everyone else is coming to the story as well.
Operator: And there are no further questions. Mr. Childs, I will turn the call back over to you.
Nick Childs: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again soon. The team will be available rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, one again. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I’d now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s business, which are discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib. 
Ari Bousbib: Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered strong financial results this quarter despite the dynamics of the broader macro environment and the various global geopolitical issues. Let me address a few of the key ones. Some of you have continued to ask about the impact of biotech funding on the CRO industry. As we have said on several occasions, the recent decline in biotech funding has not had any significant impact on our business. Our exposure to pre-commercial EBPs remains at just over 10% of our backlog. We have not seen an impact on bookings or RFPs, nor any increase in cancellations or delays in clinical trial work from the slowdown in biotech funding. Actually, RFP dollars from the overall EBP client segment continued to grow double digits in the quarter. In China, the government-imposed COVID lockdowns had a modest impact on our second quarter results, mostly from disruptions to our clinical and laboratory operations. Our commercial business was virtually unaffected. Our experience in managing through prior lockdowns during the pandemic has been helpful in minimizing the operational impacts on site closures. Our guidance assumes that modest impacts on COVID-related lockdowns in China will continue through the end of the third quarter. In Ukraine, we continued to work with sites and sponsors to ensure the safety of our employees and patients while working to mitigate trial disruptions caused by the ongoing crisis. In Russia, we continue to conduct trials currently underway to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials, but we are moving recruitment on new trials to other countries. The financial impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis are tracking in line with the expectations we communicated back in April.  More generally, we are of course monitoring, as are you, the possibility of a recession. I would just note that over the past 20 years, IQVIA along with the broader CRO industry has shown resilience to economic downturns. During recessionary times over the past two decades, annual S&P 500 revenue contracted by as much as 10% while IQVIA’s clinical business and the CRO industry as a whole never experienced a year of revenue decline. The resilience of the CRO industry likely reflects the long cycle nature of our business, as well as of course the mission critical importance of clinical research and more generally the defensive nature of healthcare. With that as background, let’s review the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. The fully $6 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was primarily driven by the timing of pass-through revenues versus our expectations, as well as some operational upside. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 16% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional details in his remarks, including COVID-adjusted numbers for each of our segments. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.44 grew 14.6% driven entirely by our adjusted EBITDA growth.  Let me provide some more updates and color on the business in the quarter. The continued strong performance at IQVIA is driven by our highly differentiated capabilities. As you know, the key differentiator for us in the clinical and commercial spaces is IQVIA’s connected intelligence. Let me give you a few examples of how IQVIA’s applications here help our clients solve their most complex problems. IQVIA’s AI-driven next best action platform helps our clients integrate multiple data sources, transforming raw data into personalized recommendations to sales, marketing and medical personnel which of course leads to deeper relationships with healthcare providers. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client chose IQVIA’s solution to completely transform their omnichannel commercial engagement model and to improve their go-to-market efficiency across multiple brands in eight countries by up to 30%. Another example in the quarter, we were selected by a top 20 pharma client to optimize the delivery of raw brand content directly to healthcare providers for one of their respiratory brands. Our solution here connects digital and field sales channels to deliver highly personalized content that results in high quality, seamless brand experience for healthcare providers. This will improve this client’s digital engagement metrics by 3.5 times. Another area where demand has been growing is pharma co-vigilance. Our platform here combines a unique catalog of over 500,000 safety-specific terms and patterns with natural language processing to mine vast amounts of online data and to identify potential adverse events. In the quarter, another top 10 pharma client selected our solution to reduce the risk of non-compliance and to increase data accuracy, ultimately improving their efficiency by up to 75%. Beyond mass pharma, our commercial solutions are also resonating with EBP clients, especially when they decide to commercialize their assets on their own following approval. For example, in the quarter we contracted with a leading EBP client to implement and manage their entire end-to-end commercial information management and to support their patient engagement and access programs. This includes data provisioning, massive data management, and data modeling. Our ability to offer these services on a fully integrated platform will allow for a more streamlined implementation, generating savings of up to 20% versus multi-vendor solutions. As you know, IQVIA continues to be the global leader in real world evidence. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA a major project in medical affairs. The project leverages our AI and ML capabilities to provide near real-time disease insights across five different therapeutic areas. These insights will help identify misdiagnosis and [indiscernible] treatments which will in turn improve patient outcomes.  As you know, our ECOA, or Electronic Clinical Outcomes Assessment platform has won multiple awards for its breakthrough patient engagement innovations. The product includes a library of over 1,500 prebuilt clinical outcome assessments which enables sponsors to deploy assessments to patients up to 14 weeks sooner than competitors’ offerings. This efficiency reduces risks to study start-up timelines and allows our clients to capture more feedback from patients, ultimately amplifying the patient’s voice real time.  A top five sponsor recently engaged IQVIA to couple this ECOA platform with our patient randomization tool so that we eliminate redundant workflows, improve data accuracy and patient compliance, thereby reducing site on-boarding activities by an estimated 50%.  Finally, in the overall R&D as business, we continued our strong momentum, delivering over $2.6 billion of total net new business in the quarter, including pass-throughs. The services bookings also remained at the historic high we have seen recently of over $1.9 billion. This resulted in a second quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs, and 1.32 excluding pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months, our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.32, both including and excluding pass-throughs. As you can see, there continues to be strong positive momentum across the business and an unprecedented level of engagement with our clients across our portfolio of commercial and clinical businesses despite the broader environment.  I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. Let’s start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.541 billion grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $250 million, which was down about $300 million versus the second quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 16%.  Technology and analytic solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.408 billion, up 4.1% reported and 9.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10%. Research and development solutions second quarter revenue of $1.950 billion was up 3.1% reported and 6% at constant currency, and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 22%.  Contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS second quarter revenue of $183 million declined 5.7% reported, but grew 2.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 7%.  First half revenue of $7.109 billion grew 3.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% at constant currency. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 14%. Technology and analytics solutions revenue for the first half was $2.847 billion, up 5.4% reported and 9.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the first half. R&D solutions first half revenue of $3.884 billion was up 3.3% at actual FX rates and 5.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19%. Finally, contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS first half revenue of $378 million declined 2.3% reported and grew 3.9% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth in constant currency at CSMS was 6%. Now let’s move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $800 million, representing growth of 10.8%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.612 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $256 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $581 million or $3.02 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $466 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.6% to $2.44. For the first half, adjusted net income was $943 million or $4.91 per share.  As already highlighted, R&D solutions delivered yet another strong quarter of new business. This graph that we’re showing here shows the growth of our backlog over the past few years at actual currency rates and it demonstrates the sustained strength of our clinical business through the COVID pandemic.  You’ll recall that as our bookings reached record levels during the pandemic, many of you expressed concern about a looming so-called COVID cliff, and we told you then that our COVID-related bookings would be replaced by new programs that spanned a breadth of our therapeutic expertise, and in fact that’s what happened. As of June 30, our contracted backlog stands at a record $25.6 billion, including pass-throughs. That’s a 50% increase over about three years. The COVID contribution to our backlog, which peaked at 11% early in 2021, is now approximately 6%. Let’s turn to the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.428 billion and gross debt was $12.767 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.339 billion. Our net leverage ratio as of June 30 was 3.58 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $329 million and capex was $161 million, resulting in free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter. This was somewhat lower than prior quarters, and it mainly reflected the timing of cash collections, which we expect to normalize in the second half. You saw in the quarter that were quite active in the market, repurchasing $590 million of our shares, and this puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity at just shy of $1 billion. This leaves us with slightly over $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Moving to guidance, our full year 2022 revenue expectation at constant currency remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the strengthening of the dollar since April has caused an incremental full-year revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $125 million, based on rates as of this Monday, July 18. We’re updating our revenue guidance to reflect this. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.4 billion and $14.550 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.4% to 8.5% at constant currency and 3.8% to 4.9% at actual FX rates. As a reminder, this equates to low to mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our projected revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A.  Since FX fluctuations have had a minimal impact on our profit, our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged. We are tightening the guidance range to be between $3.345 billion and $3.395 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 12.3%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged. We are tightening the range here to between $10 and $10.20, which translates to year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 13%.  Our full year 2022 guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. Since issuing our initial guidance at our analyst and investor conference in November, FX fluctuations have caused full year revenue headwinds of over $400 million.  Moving to our third quarter guidance, we expect revenues to be between $3.515 billion and $3.565 billion, or growth of 8.4% to 9.8% on a constant currency basis, and 3.7% to 5.1% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $805 million and $820 million, up 10.6% to 12.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42, growing 7.8% to 11.5%.  To summarize, we delivered a very strong second quarter. Our base business delivered mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our R&DS business had another strong bookings quarter with over $2.6 billion of net new business. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter hit a new record of $25.6 billion, up over 7% year-over-year. We repurchased nearly $600 million of our shares while maintaining our net leverage ratio of approximately 3.6 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and finally, we adjusted our revenue guidance to reflect changes in foreign exchange but held our earnings guidance unchanged. With that, let me turn it back over to our Operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sandy Draper from Guggenheim. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Sandy Draper: Thanks very much, and congratulations on a solid quarter in a tough environment. I guess I’m actually going to let other people ask about R&D solutions - I’m sure there will be a lot of questions there, but my question, Ari and Ron, is on the TAS side. We’re not out of COVID but certainly getting further past it and trying to act in a more normal way. Have either buying patterns or what people are focused on changed at all, so was there a certain focus during COVID of these are short-term tech solutions we need because trials are being shut down, or whatever - you know, we can’t get sales people into doctor’s offices. As we’re coming out, is the general trend persisting or are you seeing any shift and refocus on new areas on the tech side? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you Sandy, and good morning to you. I’d start answering your question by simply saying there is absolutely none of those concerns. We haven’t seen any of that. We’re very pleased with the continued growth of our TAS business, really across the board, and you know that we like to think of our business in three buckets: the high growth ones, which is real world and technology, and that represents - Mike, I’m going to say about 40%--
Mike Fedock: More like 45.
Ari Bousbib: --45% of the total, and that’s experiencing continued growth, hasn’t abated during COVID at all, and continues to sell through at the same pace. Then we have the labor-based consulting, primary market research, analytics business which grows mid to high single digits and has been very strong through COVID, and continues to be strong essentially at the same pace, and that’s about--
Mike Fedock: Twenty-five percent or so.
Ari Bousbib: --25% approximately, so the last balance, the 30% is basically our historic IMS data business, and that’s kind of flattish to up 1% or 2%, quarter-in, quarter-out, and also has been essentially flat in terms of its growth through the COVID crisis. As Ron mentioned, constant--organic constant currency revenue growth for TAS excluding COVID was 10% in the quarter and also 10% for the first half, so again really we’re not seeing anything at all that’s changed versus the pandemic peak, or before the pandemic peak. Continued strong momentum. Thank you Sandy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you, good morning. Wanted to hit on capital structure. With the obvious comments about looking at the potential for a recession, rising interest rates, etc., a number of companies have changed their capital allocation and capital structure strategies. I’m curious if you could talk about what you’re doing on those fronts, maybe discuss any terms, maturities or issues with the various fixation instruments you have on your variable rate debt, because I do believe the majority of your debt is effectively fixed at this point, and then what is embedded in your interest rate assumptions for the year and how much has ’22 guidance in total been impacted from your first guidance to current guidance in relation to the interest rate increases that we’ve seen so far. I know that’s a lot, but--
Ari Bousbib: No, I wouldn’t expect less from you, Eric. You ask one question and you manage to pack 10 questions in one!
Eric Coldwell: [Indiscernible] comments, right?
Ari Bousbib: It’s a topical question, obviously, and you can imagine we are looking at the global environment, the rates. You saw the ECB bump of 50 basis points this morning, and we do have some euro debt, as you know. Obviously there is a point at which those changes cross certain thresholds and it does have an impact on our capital structure, and we are modeling all of those and making different scenarios as to how we change or not our capital allocation strategy. For now, it remains what it was. I’m going to ask Ron to give you more detail and address the specifics of your question. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes Eric, to your specific question, I think you had asked about our--in essence about whether our debt and how much of our debt is fixed rate versus variable rate, so how much is affected going forward. I know this is of interest to the group in any event. About 45% of our debt is fixed rate, just shy of 60% is fixed with swaps. We did have a euro floor that fixed even more of our debt up until recently, but we’re about at the floor now with the recent ECB decision, so--
Ari Bousbib: Up to today, it was, like--
Ron Bruehlman: Seventy-five percent--
Ari Bousbib: Seventy-five percent fixed.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, but going forward it will be more like just shy of 60% fixed. You had asked about what our guidance assumes, and we’ve pretty much followed what the market consensus is there in the U.S. about assuming a couple of 75 basis point increases in the U.S. in July and September, and 25 basis point increases in the fourth quarter two times. For the euro, we have a series of increases, smaller increases assumed out through the balance of the year, totaling just slightly over 100 basis points baked into our numbers. That’s pretty much in line with the market consensus right now. Now, you asked also about how much has interest expense--the increase in rates affected our interest expense assumptions since November, I guess, when we put our initial guidance out. I’ll have to go back and look at that. It’s obviously had an impact, not so much in the first half of the year but more in the second half of the year, obviously, as the rate increases or the pace of rate increases has been back-end loaded in the year. We’ll have to come back with an answer to that, unless Nick has it handy.
Nick Childs: Yes, right now we’re thinking it’s somewhere between $50 million to $75 million that we’re seeing on interest, but you’ve seen that we’ve been able to hold the EPS number, so we’ve had some favorability in terms of our assumptions on share count and all of that below the line, that has kind of helped us manage that a little bit better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. Maybe I’ll take Eric’s and have a combined combo. One, if you could talk about the assumptions regarding China specifically embedded in your 3Q guidance, and then looking at the guidance that you gave for 3Q, it implies a nice EBITDA step-up in the fourth quarter. You guys obviously did a nice job managing the SG&A line in particular this quarter, so I just wanted to understand there if there was something specific to call out that was driving that step-up in EBITDA there, or what’s the explanation there. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thanks Elizabeth. These are two very distinct questions, so let me start with the second one, the fourth quarter. Look - fourth quarter, there is some level of seasonality in our business, historically it has always been the case both on the commercial side and on the clinical side, and the fourth quarter traditionally is always the strongest one.  You are specifically alluding to EBITDA, and I would point that if you go back and look in general, our margins in the fourth quarter are higher than, let’s say, sequentially in the third quarter, for example, and in general it’s about a point higher - you know, maybe a little less than that, maybe a little more than that, depending on the year. That is because on the commercial side, it’s the end of the year, a lot of the budgets tend to be spent and a lot of purchases get done last minute, and obviously both our clients want to do that before they close the year and our sales force pushes, as always, to make the quarter and so on, so forth for more sales at the end of the quarter and at the end of the year, so there’s that kind of momentum on the commercial side, whether it’s data or analytics or just across the board on our commercial portfolio. That’s always the case year in, year out, and this year it’s a little bit stronger than might have indicated in prior years, but it’s not inconsistent.  On the clinical side, it’s all driven by the execution of the backlog and when and how it converts, so that’s really--you know, we do a roll-up project by project of when we anticipate the work will be done and costs incurred and revenue recognized, and we do that bottom-up and that’s where it comes out. Again, in general fourth quarter tends to be stronger in the clinical side as well historically, and that is probably because people want to try to execute the work before the end of the year, so that’s not unusual. Agree that’s sequentially a bit more than prior years, but again nothing inconsistent. Ron, you want to say something?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, just to answer your question on China and the impact there, modest impact in Q2. We’re assuming a continued modest impact in Q3, mainly around our lab business and clinical trials as not all the sites are open in areas where there’s shutdowns or restrictions. The only caution I would say there is just that none of us knows exactly what’s going to happen in China, where future lockdowns might happen and so forth, but right now we’re not expected a big impact.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, just a remark on China, bear in mind it’s less than 3% of our total revenue. We have a strong presence there relative to our competitors and we are doing very well. On the clinical side is where the impact is. Remember, on the commercial side we have exactly zero impact from the lockdowns - that was the case during the pandemic at the peak of it, and it continues to be the case today.  On the clinical side, obviously the issue is accessing sites, and when it’s closed, it’s closed. But we have learned during the pandemic how to work with that and to do remote visits, etc., and so far at least, the impact from China lockdowns, which have been extensive, as you know, in Shanghai and Tianjin and some other areas, we have been able to manage through that and whatever financial impact was essentially absorbed in our numbers. Thank you Elizabeth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Derik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I’ve gotten a bunch of questions from investors along the lines of I think people appreciate that the RD&S business was very resilient during the past recessions, but you’re absolutely right - having done the Quintiles IPO, I remember the growth rates back then. I think the question I’ve gotten some on the TAS business, and just sort of, like, how that goes, particularly on the consulting side of the business, and any sort of potential impact from recession there. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you for the question. Look - the resilience that’s obvious on the clinical side, it’s born by the long-term history, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. On the commercial side, you are correct - I mean, I guess you pointed to consulting because consulting is usually the most discretionary type of spend at our clients. So far, not one--I would say not one noise, not one--nothing. We are looking--I am asking every day, what is going on in the business in every aspect, and I can tell you there is no indication whatsoever that somehow people are curtailing their budgets on the commercial side.  Bear in mind, the last big recession we had along with the housing crisis in the end of 2008, ’09, ’10, the commercial business was affected really by different factors. There were very large pharma consolidations, and on the commercial side when you have a large pharma merger, you go from two clients to one client, so that automatically affects your revenues. Not so much on the clinical side - generally if you are in--if the two pharma companies that merge are in the same therapy, the authorities won’t let you merge and generally when pharma merge, they have complementary therapies and the clinical trials continue. So yes, those laws, that pharma consolidation wave that took place at that time, a lot of it driven by tax considerations, affected our commercial business. We’re not seeing any of that so far. Secondly, there was a unique phenomenon then, which was that there was an unusual large number of patent expiries, and those LOEs were sort of accelerating the 2008 to 2012 time frame. There was a so-called patent cliff, and that was coupled with an unusually low number of new product approvals. The pharma commercial business is obviously driven by the net of new approvals versus patent--or loss of exclusivity, and usually that’s a net positive. At that time, there was unusual circumstances where we had a trough in new approvals and a peak in loss of exclusivity, and that was a reverse trend.  But today, we don’t see that. We know the pipeline, we know the molecules in the pipe that are supposed to be approved and the expiries and so on, and we see none of that anytime soon, so we’re not concerned and we feel that the commercial business is fairly well insulated as well.  Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.
David Windley: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  Ari, you’ve touched on China and Ukraine very effectively. The R&DS business seems to be navigating through that really, really well. Some of the things that we’ve heard are that in addition to those acute issues in certain parts of the world, that we have kind of general staff burnout like we have in the broader healthcare system, that sites are overwhelmed and site-level turnover and things like that are affecting the capacity of the site network that you might be using. I wonder if--you know, again, you guys seem to be navigating that really well, and so I wondered if you could talk to how you are supporting the sites to be able to continue to get your trials processed in an environment where the global capacity for sites is somewhat affected.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, so I assume you mean globally, not just Russia and Ukraine. Look - Russia, Ukraine, the first part of your question, we addressed that, as you said, quite effectively. That doesn’t mean that it was easy or that it didn’t consume an enormous amount of management attention and work. Thankfully we were able to reallocate resources and clinical work to other sites. Now, this itself does not add incrementally to the existing burden of the existing sites. Your second point is more--I think is truly valid. It is true we have a lot of work to execute, as mentioned many times. This is our single most important operational challenge, that is execution, and that requires people. People recruiting, retention and development is our single most important operational challenge in the current environment. I think I’ve mentioned before, and I see the trend continuing, the high attrition levels we’ve seen are somewhat plateauing and diminishing. That may have something to do with perhaps a more recessionary environment and people less likely to jump ship. It also may have to do with the fact that we really have a strong book of business and we are, hopefully, I want to believe, a more exciting work environment and more exciting company to be part of. We’re doing our part to try to retain our people. The sites themselves, we are not seeing--I’m sure if you asked specifically the individual, they’d say yes, I’m burnt out. Are we asking people to work more and to be more productive and so on? Yes, but again that’s just the nature of the type of work that we do. We’re not seeing any execution difficulties as a result of people being, quote-unquote, burnt out. We’re not. When people are burned out, they either quite or they ask to be allocated to something else, and that’s what we try to do.  We’ve always tried to prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, and during the pandemic that has accelerated. I may not have mentioned this before, but even for myself on downwards, we’ve had a dramatic change in tone and how we address issues with employees’ work flexibility. We do live in a different environment where the considerations for employees, valued employees and skilled employees to remain at the company involve more than just work and compensation, and so we are doing our part to address that.  We will be 90,000-plus people by the end of the year, and we continue to hire. In this year, we have hired by the end of the year more than 25,000 people just to replace attrition and to support the growth. We are really a hiring machine. We’ve dramatically, dramatically improved the level of sophistication of our human resource management functions around the world, and the type of analytics and artificial intelligence tools we use to track our employees’ workload are really very unprecedented, so it is an issue and we are managing it. You wanted to add something, Mike?
Mike Fedock: Yes, I think Dave, just on the color on the sites, I think one thing we’ve seen is sites engaging with our on-site support offering we have within R&DS, so they’re reaching out to us to try to assist them. I’m not going to comment to say if our sites are burnt out or not, but clearly they have a lot of work to do and we’re providing a service to help them execute that work, which is great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. Ari, I was hoping you could share more perspective on the R&D environment, just given your RFP commentary. Looking back, we had two banner years of funding in 2020 and 2021. Things have obviously slowed down here in the public markets in 2022. As you look at the things you’re bidding on now, do you have a sense for when they were funded? I guess I’m just trying to get a sense for where you think we are in this funding cycle and it showing up for late stage work. 
Ari Bousbib: Okay, well thank you and good morning. This is obviously a good question. Again, I mentioned before for the commercial side, I do the same on the clinical side, I am almost daily asking a number of people to monitor activity. Again, I wouldn’t be saying this unless I had a certain level of confidence that so far, as of late last night, I can assure you there simply is no sign that the pipeline--you know, very early indicators is slowing down, the RFP volume is slowing down, and it is across the board in every segment. The second quarter was another quarter of record bookings. I can tell you, I think the awards--the volume was the second highest quarter ever, so we’re just not seeing it. I know there are concerns, and it is true that the volume of funding has gone down, it’s just not translating into a slowdown in either the strength and growth of our pipeline has never as large, record growth and volume, both dollars and numbers, or the RFP volume or the awards or the bookings. Now, you are asking a very, very pertinent question, which is the clients, whether EDP, midsize, large pharma who are requesting proposals or who are in the pipeline, when did they get their funding; and you are absolutely correct - it takes maybe three years, I’m going to say, before the funding raised today is actually spent. A lot of what is going to be disbursed by these companies that have booked--with whom we’ve booked business each quarter is cash that was raised in prior periods, so you want to try to say, well, funding is low now and therefore two years, three years from now, maybe bookings should go down. That’s just not the experience historically. Again, our business is not dependent on secondary public offerings from pre-commercial EDPs. It’s just not. Secondly, a lot of things are going to happen over the next few years where--you know, that’s the benefit of scale. Remember we are all over the world, we have the largest volume of business of any CRO in the world. We’re not exposed to one client, two clients, 10 clients, a segment, another segment, a geography, another geography. At any given point in time, we are working on well over 2,500 trials. We are a big ship, and like every big ship, it’s very hard. You’re not going to see from us 50% growth in a quarter, but on the other hand the converse is also never going to happen. We are a very big ship, and these disturbances in a long cycle business do not affect the direction of our business. Any other comments you want to make?
Ron Bruehlman: No, I think you covered it good. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Adam: Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. What is the difference in FX headwind for 2022 the company is facing today versus what it was expecting on the first quarter earnings call?
Ron Bruehlman: It was $125 million, was the FX headwind on revenue on the full year versus what we guided in April.
Ari Bousbib: So guidance, you mean the second half? What is the question?
Ron Bruehlman: The actual FX headwind, so the FX headwind on our full year guidance--
Ari Bousbib: On revenue, yes.
Ron Bruehlman: --was $125 million.
Mike Fedock: Ninety basis points worse than last quarter.
Ron Bruehlman: Correct.
Adam: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Tejas Savant: Hey Ari, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here, and apologies for beating the R&D backlog to death here again. We’ve heard some estimates of up to a third of these pre-commercial companies possibly needing to raise capital at some point in ’23. Does that at the margin change your calculus at all in terms of who you choose to work with on a go-forward basis, or do you have perhaps higher risk adjustment triggers to your backlog as some of these companies get closer to needing a funding raise? Then if you could also comment separately on the M&A landscape and how you’re sort of thinking about that. I know last quarter, you’d said repos being the near term priority, but just curious as to your take on asset valuations.
Ari Bousbib: Well, okay Tejas, thank you very much and good morning. Look - again, your question on the pre-commercial EBPs needing more funding and having issues is a good theoretical question and correct one for the industry, we are just not exposed to those folks. We have very little of our backlog that’s with pre-commercial EBPs. Those pre-commercial EBPs have been carefully vetted because that’s our process, long pre-dating the current decline in biotech funding. We never take on a molecule that doesn’t have very solid science behind it, that our scientific experts have vetted and believe in. That in and of itself is a guarantee that the science will be developed and that the clinical trials will go on independently of the funding, because worst case scenario, that science will be purchased by large pharma. You are seeing it today. You are seeing a number of large pharma companies buying out pre-commercial EBPs because those pre-commercial EBPs may be running into funding issues but the science is good, therefore the trial will continue no matter what. That’s number one. Number two, we are not going to take into our backlog a company that doesn’t have funding. It just doesn’t happen for us. We do a thorough financial vetting of the project before we put it into our backlog, so we don’t have that exposure. Our business model is different than perhaps some other smaller CROs that essentially team up with pre-commercial EBPs and go around to raise funding and they put that into their backlog. We don’t do that, so this is the reason why we’re not seeing anything different to, again, neither the pipeline nor the RFP volume, nor the awards nor the bookings. Again, I’ve got a huge slew of numbers, I’m looking at a very fine level of granularity here. Look at oncology - if we look at our qualified pipeline, which is really--you know, with a very, very fine comb, our oncology pipeline, there are lots of pre-commercial EBPs, and that’s--I am speaking about the qualified pipeline, that’s really, really high probability, it’s up in the quarter 17% - one, seven - year-over-year. You look at internal medicine, where there’s a lot of rare disease stuff, 14% up in qualified pipeline.  The pipeline in general for EBP, the pipeline - the pipeline! - is 18% up year-over-year in the quarter. I mean, I’m looking at numbers that are literally record numbers, both in growth and in dollars and in volume, so I wouldn’t be speaking confidently if I didn’t have these numbers. Could I wake up tomorrow and the world is falling apart? I don’t know, but that that’s--you know? If I believed that, I wouldn’t cross the street. I’m looking at numbers. The rest is noise. Did you have another question? You had two questions.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, what was the second question, Tejas?
Tejas Savant: It was on M&A and just prioritizing vis-à-vis repos. Thank you, Ari.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, M&A. Well, as you saw, we purchased almost a billion dollars in the first half of the year of shares. We did very little M&A, not because we didn’t want to. At any given point in time, we’ve always had lots - I mean, lots, hundreds of potential acquisitions, small, mid, large, and that’s our job. We’ve got corporate development activities. We rarely execute on those, whether it’s for strategic reasons or for financial reasons sometimes. As you said, valuations have been a little bit out of whack. It always takes time for those valuation expectations to come down and adjust to public market valuations and the environment. I think we’re seeing a little bit more of that, so perhaps we will have more opportunities to execute in the second half, I just don’t know - acquisitions are binary, but we don’t have--you know if the acquisition makes sense, it fits in our strategy and is nothing big here or out of whack with anything that we’ve done in the past. You know what we do. We’re very disciplined, and if it fits in our strategy on the commercial side or the clinical side, then we’ll go ahead and do it if the valuation makes sense. Thank you for your question.
Operator: Our last question will come from John Sourbeer from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Sourbeer from UBS, your line is open.
John Sourbeer: Hi, can you hear me?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Yes, we can hear you.
John Sourbeer: Great. I know it’s a little early to comment on the ’23 guidance, but when you think about the headlines from biotech funding and then, on the other hand, the company has $1 billion in COVID RDS headwinds this year potentially easing comps for next year, do you think that the ’23 RDS growth is going to be in line with that long term low double-digit guidance that was provided last year at the investor day?
Ari Bousbib: Okay, let me give you ’23 guidance - just kidding! I don’t know. It’s a little bit early, and as we discussed over the course of the past hour, there are lots of macro dynamics and so on and so forth. We’re not going to start venturing. There is basically nothing different today from what we told you at the end of last year in the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our businesses, strategically or operationally. What’s changed is the financial environment and the dynamics of risk because of Russia-Ukraine, because of the energy prices and so and so forth, but that doesn’t affect, as we’ve said over and over again, the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our business. As I sit here today, those are the same as they were when we gave you long term guidance back in November. Thank you for your question. 
Operator: We are out of time for questions today. Mr. Childs, I turn the call back over to you.
Nick Childs: Okay, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you after the call and on our next call at the end of the third quarter. If anyone has any other follow-up questions, we’ll be happy to take them. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today to discuss our first quarter results. IQVIA has very strong financial results in the quarter and that is despite the broader macro environment. On this note, regarding first the tragic situation in the Ukraine, our thoughts and concerns from the beginning has been around the safety and well being of our employees, the patients we support and all those affected by the ongoing events. We've been actively supporting our employees and their families on the ground with evacuation support, relocation services and financial assistance. For example, we accelerated bonus payments and actually we continue to pay our employees there, regardless of their ability to perform any work. In addition, IQVIA capabilities are being utilized to help support the resulting refugee crisis. For example, Ukrainian refugees are entering surrounding countries with medicines and prescriptions and medical professionals in those countries are seeking to identify and convert product information on these prescriptions into their local equivalent. To help, we've established a free online service for medical professionals to search a product name, active ingredients, and strength, and the tool generates a list of matching products in whichever the local country around the Ukraine is. Also, we've been working very closely with our customers, suppliers and clinical sites across the region to ensure continuity of our in-flight clinical trials and ensure of course that our clients are able to continue to support the effective delivery of medicines to vulnerable patients in the region who depend on these medicines. In Ukraine we are providing support to ensure that trial patients who have begun receiving treatment remain on their treatment protocols. We have established direct to patient shipments of investigational medical products and patient call centers in order to ensure patient care can continue. In Russia, we are guided by ethical concerns to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials. We are utilizing our global logistics and procurement infrastructure to facilitate the movement of investigational medical products, lab kits, and samples into and out of the country to minimize potential adverse impacts to patient care. For studies that are in startup or early phase, in both countries, we are redirecting patient recruitment to other countries based on consultations with our customers. Even though a little less than 1% of our overall revenue and approximately 3% of our global patient recruitment come from the Ukraine and Russia, the operational disruptions I just described, will have some financial impact which we have incorporated into our updated guidance. Now, another key focus area for investors in the quarter, as you will know, has been the emerging biopharma funding environment. We received a number of questions on this topic since our earnings release in February and we have addressed those in multiple forums. However, there have been some lingering questions on the same topic and I want to take this opportunity once again to reiterate our comments with a specific focus, a) on the funding environment and b) on our own company's exposure to this EBP segment. I'll start by stating that the concern about EBP funding environment is overstated. I want to support the assertion with four key points. Number one, the industry has observed a slowdown in public funding compared to the record levels in 2020 and 2021, but the private venture capital markets have continued to be strong and funding in the first quarter of 2022 was the third highest ever according to the National Venture Capital Association. I will also observe that these EBP firms are seeking large amounts of cash from the very strong funding cycles in 2020 and 2021. Number two, when there is a reduction in EBP funding or the IPO market contracts, mid and large pharma companies often step up their acquisition activities of EBP companies and frankly, that benefits us as we have long-standing relationships with these customers. In fact, you may have seen the recent acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals by Regeneron, which illustrates this very point. Number three, history tells us that when EBP funding slows, it does not have a significant effect on our business. For example, following the last EBP funding slowdown in 2015, 2016, our IQVIA biotech unit saw no interruption in net new business and revenue growth, nor any unusual increase in cancellations. And finally, number four, when we look at either our pipeline or RFP activity, we have simply not seen any slowdown, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual delays in decision making. In fact, in the quarter our overall R&DS RFP dollars were up 13% year-over-year, and RFP dollars from EBP were up over 16%. The broader industry continues to show strength. We're seeing clinical trials start up 7% in the first quarter compared to last year, with a 14% increase in oncology trial starts, which is a therapeutic area, as you well know, that's predominantly sponsored by EBP. Now, let me focus on our own exposure to the same, specifically three commercial EBPs, which are those EBPs that have zero revenue, and are the most vulnerable and exposed to the funding environment. And here I want to make another four points. Number one, as of March 31, pre-commercial EBPs represented just over 10% of our total R&DS backlog. Number two, less than 7% of our overall RFP dollars in the quarter came from pre-commercial EBP. Number three, this exposure to pre-commercial EBP for IQVIA is not only minimal, but also I want to point out and underline that our vetting process for taking on a pre-commercial EBP is extremely rigorous and thorough. The process includes, for example, a review of the clients cash balances, payment history, viability and quality of their science, and of course progress with clinical developments. So, again, said differently, not every EBP who knocks at our door with a molecule that they think is interesting, makes it into our battle. Number four, I will simply remind you that this exposure primarily impacts our R&DS segment. Approximately 45% of IQVIA's total company revenue comes from our commercial businesses. And as you know, there is virtually zero pre-commercial exposure on the commercial side. With those kind of a background, let me now delve into the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. The $23 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by strong operational performance across all three segments. And that was of course partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work for both years, our core businesses grew about 13% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional detail in his remarks, including COVID adjusted numbers for each of our three segments. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9.1% reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.47 grew 13.3%, that was 4% above the midpoint of our guide, which is with about $0.03 of the beat coming from operational improvements. I'll now provide an update on the business and let's start with the commercial and technology side. We've spoken before and you're familiar with IQVIA's connected intelligence framework, which leverages our advanced analytics technology and domain expertise across the entire clinical and commercial portfolio and has been critical in supporting the emerging needs of the pharma industry. I want to give a recent example of how these capabilities are being deployed. In the quarter we entered into a multiyear agreement with Argenx for the development and commercialization of new indications for their rare disease product currently approved for treatments of a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the muscles. Our collaboration with Argenx incorporates IQVIA's Connected Intelligence to support clinical development, real world evidence, regulatory and commercial support to accelerate the development of this product for potential treatment of other severe autoimmune diseases and to expand globally. This is an exciting product with a lot of upside potential. It's currently approved for three -- six indications, has the potential for up to 15 indications. Plus this drug has already been launched in the U.S. and has plans to launch in Europe and in Japan in the next year. Another example of a client selecting IQVIA's integrated capabilities to solve complex problems is [indiscernible], a European pharma client recently selected IQVIA's Vigilance Platform and Regulatory Information Management Technology. This is an area that's a real headache for our clients. And our technology solutions simplify and streamline our processes. [Indiscernible] will benefit from our technology's integrated AI ML capabilities, automation of labor-heavy activities, and easy implementation. To date, over 150 clients have adopted one or more solutions within our safety, regulatory and four different [ph] suites of technologies. In the real world evidence, I'm sure you've seen that we were selected to support DARWIN, or Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network. DARWIN is a strategic initiative of the EMA. This is a major win for IQVIA as it draws on our proprietary technologies, methods and deep scientific and operational expertise. It will help us deepen our relationship with healthcare providers and sites across Europe. Moving to Clinical Technology, IQVIA continues to lead the industry in decentralized clinical trials. Our end-to-end solution of integrated technology and services capabilities are being utilized on just over one third of our full service trials globally. Today, we've recruited over 300,000 patients across 80 countries, covering over 30 indications. Now, whether for traditional or decentralized trials, demand for our suite of digital clinical technology offerings continued to increase during the first quarter. To date, over 400 clients have adopted one or more modules within our Orchestrated Clinical Technology suite since launch. One of these key modules for example, is our clinical trial payments solution. This technology ensures accurate, timely and transparent investigator payment processing. It is a key driver of both site and sponsors satisfaction. Four of the top 10 and 25 of the top 30 pharma clients have now selected IQVIA's payment technology solution for their trials. This includes a major award in the quarter with a top 10 sponsor to migrate their entire payment ecosystem across several legacy platforms to our technology. The scale of this technology migration is the largest of its kind in the industry and it encompasses 120 clinical studies across all phases, with over 6000 sites globally. Beyond these client highlights, our overall R&DS businesses continued to see strong momentum in the quarter, delivering over $2.5 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs. This included a record quarter of over $1.9 billion of services bookings, resulting in the first quarter of contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.32, excluding pass-throughs and 1.31 including pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.33 excluding pass-throughs and 1.32 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS grew 9.1% year-over-year to a record $25.3 billion as of March 31, 2022. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to over $7 billion growing 8% from a year ago. As you can see there is a lot of strong positive momentum across the business, regardless of the choppy macro environment. On a final note, IQVIA was named the top CRO in overall reputation by clinical trial sites around the world in the 2021 CenterWatch's Global Site Benchmark Survey. This is a big deal for us. This is a rigorous and independent survey, that is highly respected in the industry. Over 60,000 investigators, trial coordinators, research nurses, and other clinical professionals representing clinical trial sites from around the world were asked to rank and score 29 CROs across 35 performance related attributes. We are proud to have been selected and named the top CRO in overall reputation and specifically, we received high marks, especially high marks for our comprehensive decentralized trials, direct to patient recruitment, and therapeutic clinical regulatory and technology expertise. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3,568 million grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. In the quarter COVID related revenues were approximately $375 million to down about 35% versus the first quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was about 13%. Technology and Analytic Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1,439 million, which was up 6.8% reported and 9.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech and Analytic Solutions was just over 10%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1,934 million was up 3.5% at actual FX rates and 4.7% at constant currency. Again, excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was approximately 17% which was consistent with our expectations. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS first quarter revenue of $195 million grew 1% reported and 5.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was mid single digits. And let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $812 million for the first quarter, which represented growth of 9.1% on a reported basis. First quarter GAAP net income was $325 million, that was up 53.3% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share with $1.68 up 54.1% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $477 million for the quarter, up 12.2% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.3% to $2.47. Now as already reviewed R&D Solutions delivered yet another outstanding quarter of net new business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $25.3 billion, an increase of 9.1% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased 8% year-over-year to just over $7 billion and I would note that both the backlog and next 12 months revenue numbers I just quoted were affected by FX rates at quarter end and that is to say they were lower than they otherwise would have been due to the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter. Okay, moving now to the balance sheet, first quarter cash flow from operations was $508 million and CapEx was $177 million. That resulted in free cash flow of $331 million and as a reminder, our free cash flow in the first quarter of each year is affected by the timing of annual bonus payments. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,387 million and gross debt was $12,637 million which resulted in net debt of $11,250 million. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 was 3.64 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter we repurchased $403 million of our shares, which leaves us with slightly over $2.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now let's move to guidance. For the full year 2022, our expectation remains unchanged, that organic revenue growth excluding COVID related work will be low to mid teens at constant currency. Since February FX fluctuations have caused an incremental full year revenue headwind of over $200 million as of yesterday's rates. In addition, we currently estimate the revenue disruption from the Russia-Ukraine crisis to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Accordingly, we are updating our revenue guidance range to reflect these two factors. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,450 million and $14,750 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 6.9 to 9%, at constant currency and 4.2% to 6.3% reported, both compared to 2021. Now as a reminder, in the revenue guidance we've provided in our Q4 call in February, we absorbed a $70 million FX headwind versus the initial guidance we provided at Analysts and Investor Conference in November. Objective revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now, despite the macro factors that affected our revenue guidance, we're reaffirming our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges that we provided on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This includes absorbing the earnings impact of lost revenue in Russia and Ukraine as well as the costs that remain there such as salaries and assistance provided to employees. Accordingly, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,330 million and $3,405 million representing year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 12.7% and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25 or year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 13.5%. Now, our full year 2022 guidance ranges assume that foreign currency rates as of yesterday, April 26, remain in effect for the balance of the year. Moving on to second quarter guidance, I'll remind you that the first half of last year represented our peak for COVID related revenues, and as a result of that, the second quarter should be the toughest year-over-year compare in terms of revenues. So for the second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,470 million and $3,520 million representing growth of 4.6% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 0.9% to 2.4% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID related work we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens, consistent with what we had in Q1 actuals and our projected full year revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $790 million and $805 million, up 9.4% to 11.5% and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.42, growing 10.3% to 13.6%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what had been a very strong first quarter of 2021. Our base business maintained low teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID related work with double digit growth on this basis in both TAS and R&DS. Our R&DS bookings for business recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings, contracted backlog exceeded $25 billion for the first time rising over 9% year-over-year with over $7 billion expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. We maintained our net leverage ratio at 3.6 times 12-month adjusted EBITDA on a trailing basis and finally most importantly, despite the turmoil around us, we remain very confident in our outlook and accordingly have maintained a full year 2022 profit guidance. So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for our Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open, please ask a question.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Two quick ones, both on geography. First, with Russia-Ukraine, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you tell us the impact in Q1 and then how the $40 million to $50 million of annual impact is phased through the year? I guess, I would assume the majority of that or a significant portion is in 2Q, but we'd love to get your sense on how you faced that $40 million to $50 million projected impact? And then secondarily, early in the pandemic IQVIA was the first and perhaps most vocal company to talk about the impact of China in Asia-Pac when COVID first broke out. Obviously, a lot of conversation these days on the rolling lockdowns in China, I'd love to get an update on what you're seeing from the impact in that market and how you're operating across that region, given the governmental actions ongoing today? Thanks very much.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Good morning, Eric and thanks for your questions. On the first one, Ukraine, well Ukraine actually is like we're not even 1% or above 1% of our revenue a little less. So call it $130 million, $140 million, let's say. And, obviously, it's a significant displacement and the world that cannot be done primarily in R&DS. I might point out some of that may come back, some of the trial obviously needs to continue and will be delayed. It just takes time and because of the disruption, or you want to answer specifically, the question on the how much per quarter? We said it's -- we sized it at $40 million to $50 million, right? So it's less than a proportion of impact in Q1, obviously, because the conflict didn't start until late February. So we had a few million dollars of impact in Q1, not a huge impact. You're right, Eric, that it's probably that $40 million to 50 million is probably front end loaded in the year, because we should recapture a little bit as we get late in the year and we start shifting work. But that always takes longer than you think it's going to take. So, you know, we're not assuming a huge recovery of work in 2022, but ultimately, as we find new patients and move the clinical trial activity outside of Russia and Ukraine, we should recover a lot of that you know in probably back end of the year or early next. Now with respect to China, just to situate the conversation, China is about 2.5% of our global revenues and that's about half and half on U.S. and commercial. Now to take the commercial side first, we saw virtually no impact, even at the worst of the COVID crisis when everything was shut down in China on our commercial business. Obviously, some of the business that requires some face to face interactions like PMR, consulting and so on, obviously went to zero, but the rest of the business, the technology, the analytics, services continued pretty much intact. So we have no concerns there. On the R&DS the obvious concern if they were lock downs is our ability to access sites. Now, right now it's a fluid situation. We are tracking closely what's happening on the ground. We've seen some disruption to site access and patient visits, again mostly in Shanghai, because that's where the lock down has been limited to so far. It's hard to imagine that these are going to be prolonged for a very long time or expanded toward China, but again, we -- no one can tell. So that's where we are. Again, we are relatively confident outside China that when these things happen there we've learned how to deal with it with our remote capabilities and our ex-site development of decentralized trials, et cetera, we have become more adept and we are prepared to address those situations. We believe the same will be true if God forbid in China the situation were to deteriorate. But frankly, at this point, we haven’t seen much, again this is the minimus and we haven’t taken any adjustments or anything like that forecast for China. Any other comments guys? Okay thank you, Eric.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open, please ask your question. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. A quick question, just is the years revenue and profitability pacing the way that you expected as you entered the year? I mean obviously a little bit of change with Russia and stuff like that, just the second quarter guidance is a little bit lower than what the Street expected. Obviously the street does not have the insight into the pacing that you guys have at that level of detail and it could be that we just didn’t get the same kind of COVID headwind roll off year-over-year and I just want to kind of start with that question and then I have one followup.
Ari Bousbib: Well, Shlomo thank you for your question, good morning. Look, I think Ron mentioned in his introductory remarks that last year's first half included the highest, the peak revenues from COVID. The second quarter will be the toughest compared year-over-year with COVID in. Right? The biggest step down, year-over-year of COVID revenue will be in the second quarter. That's one factor. Secondly, on a reported basis, if you look at, again, assuming FX rates remain where they are for the balance of the year, the worst comparisons year-over-year in terms of FX impact, are in the second quarter, okay? But the underlying businesses when you take these out, COVID and FX, you guys help me out with the numbers, yes second quarter is consistent with the rest of…
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, very consistent. And that's why we're giving you ex-COVID constant currency organic, because that cleans out a lot of the items that cause the volatility that you're seeing. And really across the quarters of 2022, when you look at it on that basis, very consistent growth rate.
Ari Bousbib: So again, I mean, in TAS I can tell you the, what's built in our forecast and reflected in our guidance is due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID related work will be high single digits, so very consistent again with the first quarter. R&DS due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID will be upper teens. And CSMS will be low single digits, excluding COVID related work at again constant currency organic growth. So you're right on a reported basis the number with the actual COVID work included it looks a little choppy sequentially. But the reality is the underlying business is pretty consistent and pretty strong.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes and the other thing I would say Shlomo is that, that's pretty much in line with our guidance that we gave. I mean the, the linearity and how it's progressing over the quarter is exactly what we were expecting.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, perfect. Then this is another one for you Ari, just you have a really good history of being aggressive on share repurchases when the stock dips, and the stock is pulled back a lot. I mean, you know, at the Analysts Day you communicated being, and just, you know, actually more recently of having a lower leverage target in for a longer period of time. But would you consider taking up the leverage to take advantage of the stock price, given the fact that it seems like our trends in the business really haven't changed despite the changes in the stock price?
Ari Bousbib: My first inclination will be to do that, but very frankly, we're not going to do that. We can buy, you know, thankfully, there is a third factory you are articulating, which is our cash flow generation. And as you've seen, it's been pretty strong. And that allows us more flexibility and affords us the ability to do both, that is to maintain a lower leverage ratio and aggressively pursue share repurchases. You saw we bought for over $400 million in the first quarter. You know, frankly, there are time windows where we cannot buy. We reported earnings I think in February 15, and [Technical Difficulty] we be in the markets as we leverage a lot any level of time. So again, the answer to your question is, yes we will do aggressive share repurchases, but no we will not increase the leverage ratio.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Jack Meehan: Thank you, and good morning. You know, one of the big debates for this year in the industry has also been labor. How did your wage and turnover trends compare to versus prior periods? Can you just comment on how you're managing through that?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, well look, it's interesting. We've, we're obviously experiencing the same trend that we've talked about before, which is given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for talent. And we are really, really actively recruiting and hiring to meet the incremental demand. We also saw like the rest of the industry attrition pick up towards the end. I think it has stabilized I would say over the past few weeks. We track these very carefully and look at it on a weekly basis. And it seems to have kind of plateaued and maybe even start to come down a little bit. Look we have employees and we recruit thousands of employees a year. So we do the talent acquisition capabilities to be able to meet this increased demand. And we have -- we actually it is fascinating back to the Ukraine situation, we are actually looking now at repositioning individuals from these countries, Russia, and also Ukraine, in different geographies, and utilize them in other places. So we are really literally our global footprint allows us a little bit more initiative. We are seeing some margin pressure from labor cost increases, but as we have the flexibility, again, because our global footprint to do some arbitrage and moving things around the world, to optimize our cost structure, we of course, have our ongoing, that's part of our DNA, you know, we are continuing. That's what we do day in day out productivity initiatives and cost optimization actions. Look, we've also increased rate cards on existing RFPs and we are looking for ways to pass along some of those cost increases into pricing where we can. So the combination of all of that, obviously, this is easier to do, the pricing level is easier on short cycle businesses and on the longer cycle businesses where we've already priced in some price escalations, but they don't always reflect the wage inflation that we actually see in the market. But again, the combination of all of these levers allows us to manage that situation fairly effectively. And by the way, all these cost pressures that I -- that we're talking about are already factored in our guidance. I also want to point out, I mean, maybe that's not my special series on that, but we paid in aggregate the highest ever level, dollar level of bonuses for 2021 to our employee population, in aggregate we continue to pay, I would set a very respectable a high level bonuses to our employees, even during the worst of the pandemic. And I think we've seen in our employee surveys, which we do pretty frequently, higher and higher satisfaction levels and loyalty to our company. You know, my understanding is not every one of our peers has done that. And in fact, we know specifically other peer that has paid zero or very little bonuses last year. So that also has created some employee Exodus at some other peer companies, and we're benefiting from that as well. So it's a complex situation. Wages are going up. There is attrition, and so on, so forth. But there are a lot of moving parts here, including competitive ones. And we feel confident that we can address these issues without changing anything in our guidance. Thanks for your question.
Jack Meehan: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer from UBS. Your line is open, please ask your question.
John Sourbeer: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit on the real world evidence business growth in the quarter and is this still going to be a double digit growth this year you going to -- may be some of the COVID work going away throughout the year?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well look, real world evidence, we saw strong growth. You saw that in TAS in general, organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID was just over 10% in aggregate. And the high growth segments, as you pointed out, are real world evidence and of course, as you all know, Commercial Tech which continued to be strong drivers of growth. And I gave several examples, specific client examples of how in the commercial world and technology space, and real world evidence we are utilizing our unique capabilities. So, real world evidence is doing disclose the numbers here or not?
Ron Bruehlman: I mean, [indiscernible] there continues to high teen, growth driver excluding any COVID impacts. So the numbers we've been giving for real world have excluded that from the beginning. So that business has been consistently in the high to upper teens growth rates and we see that continue.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, exactly John. We see that continuing. To your last question, with respect to that COVID step down in revenue, which we've been talking about for a while now, we've always said during the height of the pandemic, that and this is true for real world, is true for commercial and certainly is extremely true for the R&DS business. COVID work essentially crowded out the rest of the business, because our clients understandably refocused their dollars on COVID, whether it's vaccines, or therapeutics, or what have you. But on the commercial side, government works to track and monitor COVID patients, et cetera and they turned to us. As you know, we had a very strong share of that market appropriately. And the concerns that some of you had expressed at that time is, well when that goes away then what happens? Well, we told you that that time that when that would go away, the base business would come back, because we knew that there were a lot of projects that have been essentially put on hold and that there was a lot of pent up demand that needed to be addressed and that's exactly what is happening. Exactly what is happening. Now that's true with real world evidence, it's true on the commercial side and it is true certainly in R&DS. Thank you.
John Sourbeer: Thanks, I appreciate the color there and then just maybe one followup. As you are approaching around that 3.5 times levered, any thoughts on M&A and what areas or potential type of businesses would you be looking at if there were do those?
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, we always said we've gave guidance, we have done, and that's been consistent. By the way you can look at our record is between 1 and 2 points of our revenue top line growth over the long-term has been supplementing our organic growth. We make acquisitions within our core businesses when they are strategic and add capabilities or allow us to enter adjacent markets where we think we can add value. We have walked away, we do walk away from I want to say 90 plus percent of the companies we look at in the market. We always felt that valuations were very frothy, and that we did not want to, despite the rate environment so long we did not want to pay for assets more than what they were worth. And unfortunately, for those who did you now find yourself in an environment where valuations have taken a beating and now you've got a lot of private equity owned businesses that are very attractive, we would like to buy. But the entry points for those current owners at the time we did the acquisition was very high. And so, I just don't know how that -- it's going to take time. And because of that I am suggesting that we are going to -- if we were always cautious we are going to continue to be cautious now. Having said that, we will step up to the plate when the acquisition is extremely attractive, extremely accretive to our operations and our financials and we've done that in the quarter actually, we bought significant lab business, which is very attractive. And I believe that's the bulk of our acquisition spending that and correct, yes. And we like very much the lab business, as we discussed before. These are very strong and necessary capabilities and our lab business has been doing spectacular. We obviously, we look at CROs when they come up, but again, the valuation premiums on those assets have been out of reach for us. On the commercial side, we've bought technology companies and we will continue to look at the digital space. We've got, as you know, a strong interest in growing, in continue to grow on the commercial side, the commercial side is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the go to market strategies of our clients becoming a lot more akin to how larger, consumer oriented businesses look at the world with much better, you see what our OCE suite, how our OCE ecosystem does with a lot of embedded intelligence is no longer -- we're not talking about a simple CRM point solution, as is the case for most of the competition, our system is an ongoing, live, with sophisticated AI analytics that enable the users to make decisions on a timely basis with respect to targeting the right customer at the right time with the right message. And so anything that complements or advances our position in the U.S. digital and European digital commercial spaces where it's most advanced, we will look at and we will be aggressive enough to enter those spaces and complement our capabilities. So that's what you know, I just gave you my overall strategic panorama here in terms of acquisitions.
John Sourbeer: Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott from Barclays. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Luke Sergott: Good morning. Thanks for the question here. Just a couple of cleanups. On the COVID step down into 2Q, remind us, I might have missed this one, can you remind us what you guys did in 2Q last year, and by the segments, just so we have an idea how that paces out ?
Ron Bruehlman: We have a combination of projects in the TAS segment, you'll recall, we did a lot of government work, which is stepping down as we go through this year. In the R&DS segment, we are working on some mega COVID vaccine studies and safety monitoring work and also therapeutics. But you know, we were involved in hundreds of different COVID related projects. So are you asking what type of work were we doing or revenue numbers?
Luke Sergott: No, just the revenue. I was just trying to get a sense, I meant the numbers.
Ron Bruehlman: The numbers like I told you was, we did about $375 million and now are you talking in Q2 or Q1 now?
Luke Sergott: Q2 last, I'm just trying to get a sense of the step down what you have the whole billion rolling off right?
Ron Bruehlman: And you can infer from the numbers we gave you on the conference call what Q1 was last year, which was, over $550 million and in Q2 it was slightly larger than that last year.
Luke Sergott: That's helpful. That's exactly what I was looking for. All right. So and there's something here a little more strategic as you think about it. So I mean, when you guys came on after the merger, you started going after the fat tails of biotech, right and going after all the bookings. And so now when you're getting up to record booking levels 1.9 plus, are you guys at capacity of what your business can handle? And I guess it's more of a sense of, I understand it's hard just to add additional bodies given the tight labor market. So give us a sense of the type of work you're now taking on how that's changed. And if we should expect you know, the overall bookings to continue to climb or if this is kind of peak at your capacity right now?
Ari Bousbib: Well first of all I -- capacity we always is people driven in this business, as you know. But I would say if anything, certainly seems to merger. Our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people has increased significantly, because of our decentralized clinical trials capabilities. The increase in technology content, in data analytics, in process improvements that we've done since the merger is very dramatic. So our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people is significantly enhanced. So I don't see, frankly our turning away work, because somehow we don't have the capacity, we just don't do that. Again, with the minor exception of what I described before in my introductory comments, for pre-commercial EBPs, that knock at our door for assistance, and that don't qualify based on our rigorous vetting process. With that minor exception, we are able, willing, eager to take on any and all work. So certainly, I hope we continue assuming the underlying dynamics of the market continue to grow, which is, I think, a very, very valid assumption and a completely conservative expectation. And assuming that we continue to gain market share, which is also I think a conservative expectation. You should expect our bookings to continue to grow over the long-term, no question about it.
Luke Sergott: Okay, thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Ari, I just wanted to circle back on EBP really helpful commentary during the script. I mean, it sounds like even if you did see some softening your business is diversified enough where the impact would be pretty negligible. But to date, you haven't seen anything. And just to clean up, I guess why you wouldn't be seeing it versus some competitors, like one yesterday, who called it out? Then coming down to your vetting process, you're maybe not taking on higher risk trials that others are and you think it comes down to kind of that process internally?
Ari Bousbib: Look, I don't know, I'm not going to speak for other competitors. I obviously people in the industry know, or have knowledge of what their peers focus on in terms of market segments. Look, from the beginning of this merger, we said we were going to be a lot more thorough in terms of what gets into our backlog. If you recall, we switched from "awarded business" to "contracted business", we became a lot more vigorous in terms of the specific booking analytics. I mean, again, I want to, I certainly hope you will never ever hear from us, God forbid it that we are making an adjustment to our bookings, because we are the some kind of some meteorites came from the cosmos and hit our backlog. You haven't heard that from us, quite the opposite. And so, we tell you what the numbers are, and those numbers are thoroughly and vigorously scrubbed. I repeat, we're not going to take it. There are many, we deal with our many clients that call or companies that call or [indiscernible] firms or they are lot of -- these are lot of biotech staff all over the world with high hopes and they'd love to have us help them and support them and they sometimes even want to leverage the fact that they are supported by a few IQVIA in order to raise money. And of course, we just don't do that. That's not our business. You know, that could be -- you know, it is often the case that an EBP at a very early stage with one molecules and high hopes and a nice looking management team, go around raising money and they come in with, at least an assertion that there is a CRO already involved and that has vetted their -- the scientific basis, et cetera. And the more credible the CRO, the better chances they have of raising money. Now we don't do that. It is simple. Others do. So that there are significant differences between how we do business. Someone asked earlier about capacity. And I said this is not going to be a capacity issue for us. But look, it's not that we are desperate for business, we have business, so we're not going to take on anyone. So I think that may be one difference. And as we said market segment focus, you have, Mike do you have any other comment?
Mike Fedock: Just to build on those comments. You know, in addition to the vetting on both the financial and scientific basis, the nature of work that we typically take in is in the later stage clinical timeframe, whereby there's a lot more I think, you know, historical data versus whether you're down feeling an EBP is mainly in the preclinical or first in inhuman space. So I think that's a that's another benefit to the [indiscernible].
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, and very important. 
Patrick Donnelly: Yep, now that's really helpful. I appreciate it.
Ari Bousbib: And then your first comment, frankly, was the right one, which is it's a very small part of our overall business, our company.
Patrick Donnelly: Right, yes, understood. And then just a quick one Ari on the pricing environment. You know, what you see in there? I know that's a concern and biotech falls off, maybe pricing soften and it sounds like you guys still have nice power there. And on the back of that, any delay in terms of getting reimbursed on some of the shifting trials in Russia, Ukraine, just wondering, as you put in a change order, is there near-term margin pressure that then alleviates as you go through the year and get reimbursed? Just trying to figure that piece out as well? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, yes, of course. But again, it's a small, small piece of the overall, and we are absorbing that cost. So we haven't changed our profit outlook and we are not planning to do that for now. There's no reason to do that. We can absorb it. We have enough initiatives. We are large enough, diversified enough that we can handle the Russia, Ukraine situation and disruption on clinical trials normal, so longer that's what, that it is what it is now. Okay?
Nick Childs: Thank you, Patrick. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call. Myself and the team will be available for the rest of the day for any follow up questions, so feel free to reach out. I look forward to talking to everyone again soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-15 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the events and presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today for our fourth quarter results. It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November. And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our three-year Vision 2022 targets. We also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next three phase -- three-year phase of our journey to 2025. The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets. This underpins our new 20 x 2025 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025. We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses. Two years -- two weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. Importantly, we earned a first place ranking within the health care, pharmacy and other services category for the first time. We ranked number one in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value. I want to thank our nearly 80,000 employees worldwide for this recognition is a tribute to their innovation and drive. Turning now to our results. We ended 2021 on a high note, despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world. We delivered robust top and bottom line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year. These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance. And, of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 2025 targets. Let's review the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments as well as higher pass-throughs, partially offset by FX headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID adjusted numbers for each segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 grew 20.9%. That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. Let me now provide an update on the business. On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption. This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place. IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches. This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement and measurement. Overall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions. There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE. In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch. Early in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine. Two top 20 pharma clients have successfully rolled out this intelligence engine to orchestrate customer engagements in over 30 countries and across more than 40 brands each. Two other top 20 pharmas are currently in the implementation phase. Another highlight in our TAS business has been the success of DMD Marketing Solutions, a leading provider of data and digital marketing solutions that help brands deliver personalized digital content to healthcare professionals. In the quarter, we entered into an enterprise agreement with a top 10 pharma clients to utilize DMD's advanced analytic capabilities to power omnichannel engagement across all eight of their brand franchises. To date, 18 of the top 20 have adopted at least one of DMD solutions. We're very excited for the future growth of this business within IQVIA. Real-world evidence and other highlights of the year, IQVIA continues to play a leading role in the use of secondary data to answer key questions for life science customers. In the fourth quarter, we won two large post-authorization safety studies in an autoimmune area with a top 10 pharma. These studies use existing healthcare data to observe patients over a period of 10 years to better understand long-term effects of the treatment. We were also recently awarded a disease registry project for an upcoming novel gene therapy. Here, we will recruit a broad population of patients with a specific disease to understand how they are currently managed in clinical practice. This information is vital to our life science sponsors to inform the design of subsequent clinical trials so they can target patient groups with the highest unmet need. Moving to clinical technology. We saw increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials, OCT platform, which supports trial planning, site management, patient engagement, trial management and clinical data analytics. During the year, we added 90 new OCT clients, bringing the total to over 350 clients who have adopted one or more modules within our clinical technology suite since launch, including all of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20. Within OCT's digital patient suite this year, we secured three preferred provider partnerships with top 30 pharmaceutical clients to provide our interactive response technology, IRT capabilities, to support site operations across their entire clinical trial portfolios. This technology facilitates patient randomization to ensure protocol adherence and streamline site supply chain management to reduce drug wastage and to drive significant cost reductions. Our solution was awarded a top-ranking by industry leaders in a recent ISR report for randomization and chart supply management capabilities. We also saw increased demand for our industry-leading decentralized clinical trial offering. Approximately one-third of our active full-service clinical trials incorporate one or more of our DCT technology or services capabilities, and we expect this to continue to grow as the need for these capabilities in complex studies becomes more evident. For example, we are currently executing a full-service trial for treatment of multiple system atrophy, a severe degenerative neurological disorder affecting the body's involuntary functions. We are deploying our full suite of capabilities, including eCOA, eConsent, and home research nurses on this study to significantly reduce the travel burden on these patients who have significant mobility challenges. Finally, our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum with over $2.4 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs, and it set a record for quarterly service bookings, achieving over $1.9 billion of service bookings for the first time ever. This resulted in a fourth quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 excluding pass-throughs and 1.24, including pass-throughs. For the calendar year, we delivered over $10 billion of total net new bookings for the first time ever, an increase of 14.6% compared to 2020. This led to an LTM contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.35 excluding pass-throughs and 1.34 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 10.2% year-over-year to a record $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. And now I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks Ari and good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.636 billion grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. You'll recall that last year's fourth quarter was a much tougher comparison than earlier quarters as we picked up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Also, the core business began to rebound from the effects of COVID-19. In this year's fourth quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $325 million, down about 25% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both 2021 and 2020, organic growth at constant currency was mid-teens. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.496 billion, up 5% reported and 6.6% at constant currency. Year-over-year, TAS experienced just over 400 basis points of headwind due to a step-down in COVID-related work. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.944 billion was up 15.4% at actual FX rates and 16.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and R&DS was approximately 25%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, fourth quarter revenue of $196 million grew 3.7% reported and 7.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. For the full year, revenue was $13.874 billion, growing at 22.1% reported and 21.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues in 2021 were approximately $1.8 billion, with just under 80% of that attributable to R&DS, about 20% due to TAS and the remainder in CSMS. The incremental COVID-related revenues in 2021 versus 2020 accounted for approximately half of our growth in 2021. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.534 billion, up 13.9% reported and 12.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7.556 billion, growing at 31.2% reported and 30.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, R&DS organic growth at constant currency for both total revenue and services revenue was low double digits. Full year CSMS revenue was $784 million, representing 5.8% growth on a reported basis and 5.7% at constant currency. And excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. Now moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $828 million for the fourth quarter, which was 12.7% growth on a reported basis. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.022 billion, up 26.8% year-over-year on a reported basis. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $318 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Full year GAAP net income was $966 million or $4.95 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $496 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.7% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20.9% to $2.55. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.760 billion or $9.03 per share, up 41%. Now as already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. R&DS backlog now stands at a record $24.8 billion, an increase of 10.2% year-over-year. Full year 2021 net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion for the first time, that's 14.6% growth compared to 2020. Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet now. Cash flow was again quite strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $692 million and CapEx was $184 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $508 million. This brought our free cash flow for the full year to a record $2.3 billion, up 70% versus the prior year. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.366 billion and gross debt was $12.125 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.759 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 was 3.56 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Now it's worth highlighting that our improved free cash flow over the last two years allowed us to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital to internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchase, while at the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio from a high of 4.8 times in Q2 2020, which you'll recall was the height of the pandemic to nearly 3.5 times. And in doing this, we achieved our Vision 2022 net leverage ratio target of 3.5 times to four times a full year early. In the quarter, we repurchased $174 million of our shares, which resulted in full year share repurchase of $395 million, and we ended the year with 195 million fully diluted shares outstanding and $523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our existing program. Now last week, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization, which increases our remaining authorization to just over $2.5 billion. Now let's turn to the guidance, as you saw we’re reaffirming the full year 2022 revenue guidance that we issued at our analyst and investor conference in November. And in maintaining this guidance, we actually absorbed a $70 million revenue headwind from FX since we initially guided in November. Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November. So to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represent year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021. Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%. And we also now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%. Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021 foreign currency exchange rates remain in fact, for the balance of the year. Now compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full year revenue growth and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022, but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business. And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful. Excluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens. At the segment level, we anticipate full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits. Research & Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens. And finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%, but excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.  Let's move to the first quarter now. As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline. In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues. As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares. For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis. Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020. R&DS recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year. Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year-over-year. We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion. We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6 x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And with that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: Thank you and good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit more about COVID and I appreciate all the color you gave, Ron, during the prepared remarks on this. So at the Analyst Day, you talked about $1 billion of COVID tapering this year, there was 1.8 in 2021. Can you talk about the balance of the COVID work and just how you feel about the duration of COVID kind of over the next few years? Do you think there's some aspect that might prove stickier in TAS or some ongoing work in R&DS? Just any color there would be great.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. Look, we do have a balance of COVID work, obviously. That's going to continue to burn off over the next two years. I think it will be a gradual decline during the course of 2022, but it's going to continue on into 2023. Yes, it's hard to foresee, Jack, how much additional COVID work there might be. We've all been surprised by the ups and downs of the pandemic and so forth. So it's certainly possible there could be more right now. We're facing our projections on what we currently have in the backlog, and we'll see where it goes from there and see what other work might come along.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Jack, I mean, this is exactly right. And I -- all we can do is look at the situation today. If anything -- if we've learned anything about this pandemic is we just can't predict the evolution. So we do have in our RFP pipeline, especially on the R&DS side, request for proposals to assist in new therapies to address COVID, there are even large top 10 pharmas that we are talking to about potential therapeutics. So I do anticipate there will be some residual amount of COVID work ongoing. But unless things change dramatically based on the picture today, it's just going to gradually taper down -- that's what we have here through 2023 and maybe beginning of 2024. Unless something else happens, which no one here hopes for. But that's what we have. It's all largely based on burning off the world, both commercial and clinical.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then just as a follow-up, it would be great to get your latest thinking on labor and maybe wage inflation? What is -- how has your view changed at all related to when you initially gave guidance around just wage inflation and the impact that might have on the forecast for 2022?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, that's a good question. That's the single most important -- operational challenge we have is people management. I mean look, it's wonderful to be the leader in this space and to have such -- a $25 billion backlog to execute and strong commercial demand as well. And the result of that is we need a lot of people, even though technology is gradually taking over more and more of the work that we deliver, but we still need a lot of people. And at 80,000 people, we know we have to recruit many thousands more this coming year. We have attrition, which is an issue really for everybody. The great resignation is affecting us as well, post-pandemic. We are -- we've become -- and that's the price of our success. I might say, we have become an academy company, a lot of people recruit talent from IQVIA. But look, we are adjusting to this. We're creating all kinds of flexible work arrangements, compensation arrangements, loyalty building programs, training programs, back-to-work, the future of work, which is an initiative that we have to redefine roles and what's expected from our employees. So, we've been very innovative in terms of our workspace, really working on a lot of multiple fronts. With respect to the numbers and how it affects our numbers, obviously, it's challenging when you have to raise compensation costs and generally people management costs. However, I would point to you that our margins, our adjusted EBITDA margins has continued to grow. I mean in fact, they've been growing more than -- and they are expected to grow more than ever before. We -- and the reason for that is we are finally getting the leverage on the massive restructuring and cost improvement initiatives that we launched immediately post-merger. And we're now getting the benefit of that leverage and that's offsetting -- more than offsetting the wage inflation headwinds. Again, I'd point to the growth of our profit numbers relative to the growth of our revenue numbers, and you see that we significantly materially raised -- grow our profit higher than -- materially higher than our revenue growth, which implies significant margin growth. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. And also I would say, Jack, that we do have the ability in a lot of instances to raise prices to adjust prices. We have some provisions for improvement in our MSA agreements. We also have some short-cycle businesses. So, wherever we have the ability to adjust prices, we are doing so. And we're getting some offset there as well.
Jack Meehan: Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you. Good morning. So, probably the number one topic here recently has been the biotech funding environment and any potential knock-on impacts to the group. Your competitor, who also reported at the same time this morning and is very exposed to pre-commercial biotech, said their RFP volumes were down 10% in the fourth quarter, down 25% in January. But that they haven't seen any cancellations or delays so far, no business impact so far. I'm curious if you could help us by, one, talking about your mix of pre-commercial biotech as a percent of R&D backlog or bookings? And two, talk about what you're seeing in real-time in terms of business demand bookings, other related activity in that pre-commercial biotech space? That would be very helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thanks, Eric. Well, as you can imagine, we track these numbers pretty tightly. And as you know, many definitions of what biotech funding and so on. We are not seeing in the actual RFP pipeline any changes versus what has been. As you know, a very strong demand environment for the EVP segment in general. In terms of percent of our bookings, what do we give you, we don't have the backlog, but we have the bookings. Let me see -- I have got a few numbers here for you. I think, look, in terms of the actual bookings, large pharma still represents the majority, right, a little bit over half. Is that correct?
Ron Bruehlman: That's correct.
Ari Bousbib: Right. And then we -- maybe the midsize is perhaps about somewhere around 10-ish percent -- 
Ron Bruehlman: Yes.
Ari Bousbib:  -- of our bookings. And the rest, so again, I'd say 35% plus is EBP. And that has been the case -- again, it fluctuates, as you can imagine, these things -- these numbers go up and down. Now if you compare where we are here in terms of the pipe of the RFP, of flow, okay? It still continues to grow double digits in dollars and volume. I mean, it's really, really high, more than double digits. I don't know if we can give you the numbers, but the pipeline is very, very strong. I mean, actually, it's about -- our pipeline is about equal to our backlog as we speak right now, okay? And again, as I said before, COVID is basically gone more or less. It's very, very tiny percentage of the total pipeline here. A lot of it is oncology, which is up more than 20%, the CNS, more than 33% up. Agree, across therapy categories, we are seeing very good EBIT growth in the pipeline. I'm talking now, okay, not the book. I'm talking the pipeline, to your question, what do we see going forward, okay, which would be normally a line indicator of the funding. And we see that EBP in the pipeline actually represents a majority of our pipeline right now. So, again, we don't see any significant changes. Look, I wouldn't -- yes, it's true. For example, January was lower -- the month of January was lower than of EBP funding, but I wouldn't extrapolate from one month and -- or from one quarter for that matter. As you know, generally, the levels of EBP funding are very, very high. I mean, we are -- we must be in the top three years ever in terms of funding. So, okay, maybe that this year will be a little lower than last year, which, again, these were record years. We're talking about orders of magnitude greater in terms of multiples of the funding, if you just go back three, four, five, six years. So, yes, I mean, the step-down in funding would -- doesn't concern, as we continue to see very, very good, both bookings and even higher numbers in the pipeline.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, Ari, if I could just do one follow-up. The -- could you remind everyone what your definition of EBP, the emerging biopharma, what your technical definition is, what it takes for a client to fit into that category versus some of the other?
Ari Bousbib: Well, we look at how much the spend in terms of clinical development, of R&D spend. Okay.
Eric Coldwell: Some of that client base -- 
Ari Bousbib: So below that number -- I'm sorry?
Eric Coldwell: Go ahead. I was just going to say some of that client base would actually be companies that have a commercial pipeline, they wouldn’t have these -- ?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, yes. That's correct. That encompasses what you might call small pharma as well that has commercialized products, in addition to commercial.
Ron Bruehlman: Let's say, if a company spends less than a couple of hundred million, I don't know exactly the number and how we segment it, we have, as you know, tons of analytics and segmentation definitions. But broadly speaking, a company that spends less than a couple of hundred million dollars in a given year in its R&D budget, for us is an EBP, that's just one definition. We've got others also we triangulate, as you can imagine. But that's one definition that I happen to like.
Eric Coldwell: All right. Last one. If you had to guess and maybe you're not willing to do so, but if you had to guess just off the cuff, not holding your feet to the fire. Would 10% of your backlog be pre-commercial biotech? 20%?
Ari Bousbib: I don't know if I can give you these numbers. But you know what, why don't we do this? Why don't we give us on follow-up questions, we'll try to give you a little bit more clarity or range on what's in the backlog. We will try to that. I'll ask the finance team here to -- I'll try to prevail and use my executive privilege to prepare all these guys. But I don't know at this point, you're putting me on the spot here. I don't know exactly what I'm going to give you but I will give you something.
Ron Bruehlman: Eric, it's helpful to give you a partial answer to that and say the last two years, large pharma orders had been -- bookings have been slightly over 50% of our bookings. So that gives you at least to start at what you're looking at anyway.
Eric Coldwell: Right. Yeah, correct. All right. Well, look, I appreciate it, and I thought you had a great quarter. So good job, keep it up and look forward to the rest of the call. Thanks so much.
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you, Eric. Usually, you tell this at the beginning of the question, so I was concerned, but thanks for saying it again.
Eric Coldwell: All right. It's all good.
Ari Bousbib: All right. Next question.
Operator: Your next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey thanks. Ari, given that most of the questions we're getting are on RFPs and wage inflation, I want to go back to the wage inflation discussion and EBITDA margins because it is notably you're guiding for expansion here. You talked about benefits from the original merger and integration plan. You talked about digitization and maybe some price increases. But can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on how you're planning to drive margin expansion in this environment this year? Are you pulling forward any additional cost actions?
Ari Bousbib: No. Not at all, not at all. As I said before, just to make myself clear again, the -- largely, the main driver of our margin expansion is simply leveraging the benefit of all the cost actions that we took post merger, okay? You will recall -- go back and look at the numbers; we have significant restructuring amounts every year, which obviously affected our cash flow. And we are now benefiting and leveraging those overhead optimization, outsourcing actions, consolidation of infrastructure, merging of IT systems, et cetera, et cetera. Now in addition to this, part of the reason you see margin expansion actually probably accelerate in 2022 versus 2021 in a quite significant way, I think some of it is what I just said and some of it is a mix benefit. I want to remind everyone that the COVID related work, which was quite significant portion over the past year or two, was at a lower margin than we would otherwise have our base business at, okay? Last of it was government work, whether it's on the commercial side, very small margins or on the R&D side, where we also contributed to the global effort to address the pandemic by pricing our COVID-related clinical trials not at the same level as we would otherwise have for traditional work. And so in terms of mix, as this COVID-related work gradually tapers down and the base business continues to grow as a proportion of the total, then of course, you've got a benefit on the margin side. I might add further that the amount of pass-throughs on COVID-related work was unusually high, vaccine trials and came also earlier on than it would under normal trial timelines. So the combination of lower margin service margins to start with, to us, a higher proportion -- an unusually high proportion of pass-throughs, all of that are contributed to be to an adverse impact, mix impact on our margins. As this work gradually tapers down, then obviously, the mix impact our margins is going to be more favorable. And that's the other reason you see an acceleration of our margin growth.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on APAC. Your long-term guidance is 11% to 13% growth through 2025. Obviously, within China, there's been a lot of noise, biologics getting placed in the unverified list. They're CDMO, you're a CRO, so very different markets. But can you just talk on your view on China here in the near-term? And does any of this kind of noise potentially benefit you?
Ari Bousbib: Well, I mean, I don't know if we disclosed this, but we've got a couple of $100 million business in China. It's been growing double-digits over the last few years. We have a fully owned CRO subsidiary in addition to IQVIA, we have a core IQVIA business, and we've got a fully owned CRO subsidiary that's called Punto [ph], which is designed for local Chinese regulatory requirements and largely caters to the local market, the local biotechs, whilst IQVIA parent deals with the work of multinational sponsors for their piece of the clinical trial in China, when it exists. It's a unique setup, which in combination with our global CRO platform allows us to capture higher growth opportunities with China. Again, we feel good about our capabilities in this market and about our prospects to continue this growth trend. Look, there are local CROs that are emerging that are formidable competitors that are gaining share. There are hundreds literally of outfits in China. As you know, I want -- I don't need to be able to pull, but China is a complex market. There are lots of factors external to our industry that can affect how market dynamics play out. But I'm -- we're not worried, we're not concerned. We are continuing to invest as required. We have a good market position and it's a small piece of our total business.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. One last quick one before I hop off. On OCE on the retention, you talked about 350 clients using one or more. Your biggest competitor did, I think, talked about winning back Roche. Are you able to comment on that at all?
Ari Bousbib: Anyone?
Ron Bruehlman: No. Look, we don't comment on individual customers and dynamics with individual customers. And as the Roche win is a very big win and the large majority of that is outside of the U.S., I think about 90% or so.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, 90% of the world -- of the project is outside the US. So I think the other, an independent subsidiary...
Ron Bruehlman: Yes.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, that has its own program. But yes, no -- Roche has reaffirmed their commitment and is looking to accelerate the rollout actually after the successful implementations we had in several regions, plus they've also expressed interest in purchasing other modules. So we're very pleased with our collaboration with this client. But beyond that, we're not going to comment. Yes.
Ron Bruehlman: Next question.
Operator: Your next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to come back to -- you guys made the comment that you expect your R&DS revenue growth this year, I think, to be in the upper teens if you ignore COVID work, which is a very impressive number. Just curious, what do you think that business can do longer term?
Nick Childs: Longer-term growth. Yes, I think -- look, I think that the double-digit growth was a marker that we have achieved and strive to achieve. If you remember at the beginning of the merger, the growth was very low in the single digits. So we think the continued acceleration will continue and certainly got double-digit sort of mark in the longer term is something that we're looking forward to maintain that acceleration.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look at our investor conference, we gave you even '25 targets for our company as a whole. And we said that the company as a whole will grow 10% to 12% annually, which presumably from a $15 billion base. So R&DS has to be growing into double digits in order to achieve that. And so that's kind of where we -- you know we view guidance or so by segment for '25? Do you have those numbers? While the team here is bringing this up. But again, I call your attention -- I bring your attention what we gave as a longer-term growth trend just a couple of months ago in November in New York, when we were all together in-person, and we gave you long-term goals and growth trends and all of which represented a significant acceleration versus what we've had over the '19 to '22...
Nick Childs: Strong double digits at the investor conference.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, strong double digits. Yes. So that's the long-term trend of the business. And again, I point to you that these are large-scale businesses.
John Kreger: Yes, absolutely. Very, very impressive. And a quick follow-up, Ron, I think this one is probably best for you. In the quarter, can you remind us what the acquisition contribution was to growth? And did you buy anything notable in the fourth quarter?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes. The acquisition contribution to the growth was relatively minimal. It was a little over 150 basis points -- we made a couple of acquisitions in the quarter. The largest of which was a payer analytics company in Europe, but nothing terribly large.
John Kreger: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Yes, Ari, can you talk a little bit about the breakdown of the upper single-digit revenue growth in TAS when you exclude COVID? What's driving the growth there? Is it real world evidence? Is it technology? And I know the information, part of the business doesn't grow much at all. So maybe you can just help us with the composition and what are some of the really big drivers there.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. What I -- we've done this before. We've told you what it's comprised of. And if you look at TAS, I mean, I'd like to look at it in terms of three tiers. You've got the basic core information solutions, which is the old IMS business, essentially the data. And that's about, I'm going to say, 30% of the business, give or take. And that's a flattish growth rate business, okay? No -- and that's strategic. That's the way we do it. We just sell the data with very little price increases. It's a flattish business. Then you've got the moderately growing piece of the business, which is, let's call it, another quarter at this point, maybe a-quarter of the business that's analytics, consulting various services. And that grows double digits now. It's been growing strong double digits in the past two, three years, used to grow mid to high single digits. Now it's growing low to mid-double digits the past few years.
Ron Bruehlman: Low teens.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, low teens. Yes. And then you've got the higher growth businesses. And that's the real world and of course, the technology businesses, which will grow good mid-teens. And that's about -- when it was to the balance, was like at 45% of the business today. Obviously, we used to say it's a-third, a-third, a-third. Now, obviously, because real world, the fastest-growing piece of TAS, real world and technology are growing at a much faster rate. So they now represent already 45% of the total. And so, if you do the math, that should get you to high single digits underlying growth for the segment.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, maybe just for Ron. How much is the incremental FX headwinds impacting EBITDA and EPS guidance for 2022? You talked about absorbing the $70 million of revenue. If I were to normalize, how much was that impacting the guidance and just maybe give us a little bit of color on that.
Ron Bruehlman: Well, we offset the entire $70 million in maintaining our revenue guidance. So, I mean, another way of looking at it, as we raised our constant currency revenue guidance by $70 million. I'm not sure I understand your question beyond that. EBITDA?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: If it’s the EBITDA. Yes. EBITDA, you went up like $10 million on each side and EPS of like $0.05 in each side – is that sort of revenue...
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, EBITDA typically doesn't have a big -- an FX typically doesn't have a big impact on our EBITDA. We've had a little bit of negative drag from FX, not like we did with the revenue that we absorbed in our numbers. And we have more offsets on the EBITDA side than we do on the revenue side, so you don't see as much impact there.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A question earlier. Can you just talk a little bit about the outlook? Obviously, cash flow really strong, leverage is pretty reasonable at 3.6 times. Are you seeing more activity in the pipeline given some of the volatility in the public markets, or does that take a little bit longer to play a role in kind of rattling out the potential sellers?
Ari Bousbib: Well, that's a good question. Look, we always -- obviously, we're always looking and even if you weren't looking, people call us. There are lots of assets that are in the market. We haven't been that active over the past couple of years in terms of numbers of acquisitions. We've done a little bit more in dollars this year, largely driven by our largest ever deal, which was simply the consolidation of our lab business. We bought 40% that we didn't own from Q² -- I'm sorry, from Quest, that was our Q² lab joint venture, and we paid, I think, $760 million for that and we need a couple of more larger acquisitions. As you know, the multiple valuations in this space where we operate in the healthcare, technology, information space, the multiples that are really very high, and the reason for that is that private equity essentially is trading those assets from one private equity firm to another. And so they keep bumping up the valuations. And we look at these assets, but we are always going to continue to be very reasonable and conservative. If we see value that we can create, then we will certainly look at these assets. But no major changes versus what you have seen us do before. We will be opportunistic if there are things -- assets that we would like to own, we will make a reasonable bids, and we won't get excited by what we have told the market is. Plus I've got good balancing CFO here with saying that we have healthy discussions with the business heads. And again, I hope that you could see from our history that our capital deployment has been prudent. We've been willing to have more debt and we may be willing to have more debt if necessary because we believe our business model is very different. Leverage for us at the peak of the pandemic was 4.8. And as a company or even if you go back the legacy companies, we believe with leverage ratios that were even six times. And the reasons for why we were willing to live with those leverage ratios is simply because our business profile, our cash flow generation model, our business visibility profile where a vast majority of our business is already booked early in the year, both commercial and clinical, all of that makes us comfortable that we can live with those, especially in an environment where I know there's a lot of talk about rising rates. And I would remind you that the bulk of our debt is at essentially fixed rates largely because of hedges and the alignment between our euro and debt and euro profits and dollars versus dollar profit. So all of that makes us comfortable, rates continue to be at historic lows. So we will do what's right for the business. We will allocate capital to first, internal investments; secondly, to acquisitions; then thirdly, to share repurchase, and you will see us go back and forth depending on opportunities. But again, we intend to try to continue to reduce debt as is prudent within the limits of what makes sense from a management standpoint, it doesn't make sense to eliminate our debt at the current rates. I mean, we would view that as a negligence on our part. So that's, I guess, the best answer I can give to your question. Thank you very much. We're done?
Patrick Donnelly: Yes. Thanks Ari. And if I could just squeeze in one follow-up, if you have a minute. I just want to follow-up on the funding backdrop. Obviously, you've talked a little bit about the R&DS strength going out multiple years, double-digit growth. I guess when you think about the funding, I mean, it seems like you were never underwriting the type of record strength we saw last year in order to hit those numbers. If we did see some prolonged softness in the funding environment relative to last year's levels, it's still more than sufficient to support that growth outlook, I guess I just want to make sure that's the way you're framing it.
Ari Bousbib: I cannot be -- I cannot overemphasize that we are not seeing that translate into our sales pipeline. I mean again, I gave you some numbers earlier in biotech, I'm not giving you the numbers here because I don't know if I should give them to you or not, but the vast -- the majority, a big majority of the RFP dollar pipeline and numbers, volume and dollars is actually EBP. So we are not seeing any impact from potential slowdown of the funding into our pipeline, not at all. And the pipeline is at record high levels. So again, we -- it won't affect us one bit. And by the way, again, I'm not seeing that happening. We talk to EBP all the time.
Patrick Donnelly: That’s encouraging to hear. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Thank you.
Nick Childs: Thank you. That's going to be our last question. So thank you for taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking again next quarter. Myself and the team will be available for any follow-up questions you might have in the rest of the day. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today for our third quarter results. Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through these disruptions. Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels according to the National Venture Capital Association. Funding total of $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year of 2020. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000 molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of recent years with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end markets and for IQVIA in particular. As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022, ahead of our usual time line which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February. And we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of our Qs growth. We look forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then. With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat as well as by stronger organic revenue growth. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-the-line items. Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited several IQVIA publications. With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine driven trials, the number of single-arm clinical trials increases every year and external competitors provide important context for these studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a top 20 pharma clients. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapy. And IQVIA's innovative real-world capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA technology platforms to capture secondary data was pivotal in this award. On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE wins to date to 169 customers. But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our orchestrated clinical trial suite, OCT. This quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module. Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages. Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with decentralized trials or DCT. The IQVIA decentralized trial offering combined several tech modules within our OCT suite including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities, including home nurses and phlebotomists along with our decentralized trial patient cancers and study coordinators, all organized around our decentralized trial platform. Importantly, we've developed innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services to accelerate recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to 30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often with the report as their DCT business. When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our decentralized trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40 countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of chose for decentralized trials and utilize the full capabilities. Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10 billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 including pass-throughs, and 1.28 excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&D, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities. We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot innovation laboratories in North Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. These new services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion, of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in Scotland. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman : Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8% reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency. In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2% at constant currency. Finally, contract sales in Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and 12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and 5.1% at constant currency. Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $261 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share. Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion. Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30 came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million, and with CapEx of $162 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion which continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. In the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188 million at the midpoint. This reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX versus our previous guidance. Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about 120 basis points to full year revenue growth. We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980 billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion, rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%. Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now our full year 2021 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in fact for the balance of the year. Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked up incremental demand from meta vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits reflecting the expected year-over-year decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently accelerated. R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens with services growth in the mid-teens despite last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9% to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%. So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger : Ari, thanks for all the detail around the OCT and DCT offerings. That was great. Curious if you could just take that one step further, what do you think the operational implications are for you guys and your clients as you see greater adoption of some of these newer technology tools?
Ari Bousbib: Well, I mean, operationally, obviously, you know that one of -- the single most important challenge we and actually the entire industry has is the ability to deploy people, again, the strong book of business that we've all generated. And so this is a great development because what DCT does is it kind of increased productivity, reduces labor and enables us to essentially execute more efficiently. So I think operationally, we are just adapting to this. Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully decentralized trial that I explained because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well, we've had a [Indiscernible] DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned, about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices. Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think hands down, I believe we are leader in this space.
John Kreger : Sounds good. And one quick follow-up on staffing. Obviously, we've -- there's a lot of talk about a tight labor market. Is that proving to be any sort of a headwind for you guys on EBITDA margins? And have you seen your staff attrition rates change at all as we've moved through this year?
Ari Bousbib: I mean, there's no question about it. It's not a secret. This is true across industry sectors and in our sector, in particular, since we have such a strong industry backdrop. There's a lot of competition for talent. We have all of the peers in the CRO space are hunting ground for talent. So obviously, we are responding. We are actively recruiting and hiring to meet this demand. We recruit dozens of employees every year. So we've got whole talent acquisition capability that's global and that's active, or does it create cost pressure? Yes. And it's already included in our guidance, that certainly a headwind. But as you well know, by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past, in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- the operating margins expanded quite nicely and this is despite the cost headwinds that we have. So yes, it is a headwind, and we are dealing with it and offsetting with the usual productivity and efficiency programs that I hope we've been demonstrating we're good at.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: I have a couple as well. First one, I think the number one inbound this morning is on your M&A spend in the quarter. Obviously, a much higher number than we were anticipating with the Myriad deal sizing being known. I'm curious if you could address that in a couple of ways. One, the type of deals, nature of deals, number of deals but also what impact you expect on a revenue basis, both in the fourth quarter as well as any thoughts on the run rate of the companies that you've recently acquired? And I might have a follow-up as well.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. So let me take the latter part of your question first. In the quarter, the contribution of M&A was minimal. I mean, maybe a little over a point. And that's the same basically for R&DS and for TAS. In the fourth quarter, Nick, a little bit more than that?
Nick Childs: Yes, fourth quarter total company were a little over 1.5 points.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, 1.5 points of contribution to our revenue growth. Now yes, we had a big spend this year. It's going to be lumpy. We always see acquisitions is binary. It happens or it doesn't happen. I will note that we didn't spend very much last year. I think in the entire year, we spent $177 million. And there are quarters where we spent $10 million or $50 million. And this quarter and this year, actually, we spent quite a bit more money. As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date. In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2 largest accounts for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that ,80% to 90% of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM Lab, which we had announced during our second quarter earnings and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology. We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset. And yes, it did come with a lot of -- it costs quite a bit. So these 2 transactions, again, is basically the bulk of the spend.
Eric Coldwell: Now Ari...
Ari Bousbib: You have a second question, right?
Eric Coldwell: Yes. Just a clarification on the first one. So the last one, I think you said DMV, if I understood correctly.
Ari Bousbib: DMD, as in David.
Eric Coldwell: DMD. Okay. Got it. And then is that actually a CSMS segment deal? Or is that a Tech &  Analytics deal?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, it's a Tech & Analytics deal.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. And then my follow-up is my typical burden on you to talk about COVID contributions in 3Q for revenue and bookings, specifically in R&DS but also other segments as necessary. If you could update us on the backlog of COVID work in total in R&DS and then talk about bookings in 3Q related to total COVID-related activity would be great.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean as we think our COVID work is obviously going to -- it continues a little bit. There is a tail to it. But certainly, on the TAS segment, it's a significant step-down. We have signaled this before. The government-related coverage work is gradually going away and certainly will start down dramatically in the fourth quarter and going forward. And we're just going to return once you eliminate the noise of what that happened last year. The TAS underlying organic growth rate is in the high single digits. You remember TAS historically was in a mid-single-digit grower and in our investor conference in June '19, we said that TAS would accelerate to high single digits, and that's where we've been most of the year. We've told you that when we reported prior quarters that the TAS growth rate included significant COVID-related work. And excluding that the growth rate was in the high single digits, and it remains so when you take out the noise of the compares, et cetera. On the RMBS, can you give us the numbers?
Ron Bruehlman : Yes, sure. Look, first, we like to look at the contribution of COVID to the backlog. And if you strip out the mega vaccine trials, Eric, from the backlog of R&DS, it's less than 5% of the backlog. If you take out all COVID-related work, it's less than 10% of the R&DS backlog. And you were asking about the contribution of COVID to revenue, I think, 2 in the quarter. And look, R&DS had very strong growth, even accepting the COVID-related work. If you take out the large fast burning COVID work, you were in the high 20s for R&DS revenue growth. And even if you take out all COVID-related work, you were still strong teens growth. So COVID did contribute, of course, and the work will trail down over time. But the underlying business in other therapeutic areas is very strong and ramping up as we go forward in R&DS.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: I wanted to continue on the COVID conversation. But looking at the TAS business, I think you referenced when talking about the fourth quarter guidance some headwinds versus the prior year. But could you just maybe talk a little bit about how you feel like the longer-term durability of COVID work in the segment? Just your thoughts around that?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Again, there's no headwinds in the fourth quarter for TAS. The growth rate is slower simply because it's a mass question. We're comparing last year's fourth quarter, which was -- which included the COVID work and a bunch of noise with the fourth quarter here, which eliminates that noise. Again, when you eliminate all of that, the underlying organic growth rate for TAS is in high single digits in the fourth quarter. So there is no headwind in the underlying business, and we expect that trend and momentum to continue. We will, as you know, provide -- we generally provide guidance on the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings. Last year, because it was such an unusual year, we decided to give guidance for 2021 concurrent with the release of our third quarter earnings. And this year, we plan to do it at our November investor conference, which is just 3 weeks away.
Jack Meehan: Great. And I don't want to steal any thunder from the Investor Day a few weeks from now, but I was curious if you could talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes for 2022. The funding environment, as you referenced, seems very strong. Are there any takes that you would consider? And then the one thing that stands out to me is pass-throughs. They've obviously been elevated this year. Just any color around how that might phase in the next year would be helpful.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So I mean, look, it's always important to put things in context and look at the longer-term trends as you're asking. And if you go back to June '19, we gave a 3-year set of targets for revenue, profit, EPS, capital deployment leverage, et cetera. Now no one could have predicted then that 6 months later, we would be starting the pandemic, and we would have such disruption across the world for all businesses and including for ours. But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because of that. And a little bit of this is because of COVID and the pass-throughs that you just referred to. But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics. Now I don't know if you had that conference, but as you're doing now and as your colleagues are doing, trying to push me for even more precision on what the numbers would be, I said then that I was hoping to exit 2022 at a 10% growth rate for the company. Now I've said before, earlier this year, that we reached our end of '22 targets in '21. And I believe that, that momentum will continue into '22. So that's all I can say, and I have to wait for more precision to 3 weeks. But I totally sitting here feel very, very confident that we will certainly exceed those numbers that we gave you years ago and set the stage for further acceleration beyond.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Ari, can you talk about where you are in general with the OCE implementations, particularly with like Roche and AstraZeneca? Have you gotten to the point where the implementations are not a significant drag on the margins that you have to offset in other areas? And just where are you seeing the business progress in terms of hitting kind of a steady state of revenue or revenue exceeding the cost to implement.
Ari Bousbib: I mean, you bring up a report, implementations are very costly. And because we have the large annual wins, and I referenced an additional 10 new wins. So every time a new award, again, you have to implement. So it's not like when you are behind the curve of implementation and start generating the license revenue, you still have to implement the new one that you sold and we're happy we did. So we not pass that headwind, if you will, in terms of the implementation costs. That's a significant drag, and we've not seen yet we haven't passed, if you will, that inflection point where you're now essentially plateaued your market penetration and you're essentially sitting tight and collecting license revenue for Moody's installations. We're not there in aggregate.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then just maybe this one's for Ron. The free cash flow was incredibly strong. Something -- there's more of this year, 33% more than you had all of last year, which was, I think, a record quarter. Could you talk about what's going on? There was a significant increase in unearned revenue and some other working capital changes? And how should we be thinking about this on a go-forward basis? Obviously, very healthy numbers. Is this something that you can keep up? Or is it or adjusting and catching up on some of the working capital items?
Ron Bruehlman : Well, Shlomo, we've made a really concerted effort internally here to improve our processes around receivables, which, of course, is one of our largest classes of assets. We don't have inventory, as you would have in a manufacturing firm receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our deferred software investment. And that's been -- our efforts have been on several fronts. First off is collecting on time. We had a -- go back a little while, we had a large amount of overdue receivables. And that's just kind of focused to go and collect what's due from us. The next is billing on time. I mean, we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more timely fashion. And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that we get. We again made an effort internally to negotiate contracts with our customers, so we get paid more upfront. So we're not out of pocket, and this has helped substantially. And I expect all 3 of those that continue to be a driver of strong cash flow in the future. Now, of course, having said that cash flow is lumpy. Quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to predict. And you do get instances where you'll get an unusual amount of advances to some of the work you're doing that will burn out off over time and then rebuild up. So I would urge you not to focus too much on the quarter-to-quarter. But yes, what you're saying is that fundamentally, we've improved our collections processes and improved our underlying free cash flow generation as a result.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean if I just might add to that, we're very pleased with the performance, but let's be honest. This was a bad a bad point for us. And I think some of you had pulled that out in the past 3 years or so, our cash flow performance was simply very poor. So the fact that we are now performing very well is not an unusual thing. I mean I think not too long ago, in 2018, we generated just barely over $600 million of free cash flow for the entire year. And here we are, 3 quarters into the year, we've already generated 3x that number. Obviously, we are a much bigger company and so on. But look, the outperformance was just not good. and we said that and was on us, and we work on it, and we will continue to pay attention and have the right metrics and the right incentives and the team focused on it. And as always, when you shine the light on something, it improves. And that's what will happen here. And where we are now is the normal, not unusual.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
Dave Windley: Wanted to follow up on, I believe, a John Kreger question around DCT. He asked around operational. Ari, I wanted to ask around financial. It seems like you now have a pretty substantial number of trials where you're running pretty fully on your DCT platform. I'm wondering if you could relate to us what -- how that changes the dollar value of a trial? And does that give you the opportunity to garner more margin in that trial because of the technology-enabled efficiency?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operational DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're raising. Our experience, customers are striving with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the model. Now obviously, your question you asked is a question what I asked of us many years ago, which is as you seek to replace labor in a model that where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera, what are implications on the margin. So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long run effort to switch pricing to value and deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing to pay a premium for that. Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before. And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity. So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have -- I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I said, just under maybe 900 to also full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that. If you look at the total trials we're involved with, this over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a margin accretion over the long term.
Dave Windley: Great. If I could ask a second follow-up around a question on COVID. It seems like a lot of focus on how much revenue now and how much in backlog now, it seems equally important to me, if not more so, to focus on how that will phase out. And I think you've made comments in the past that you see projects booked out through '22 and maybe even into '23. Would it be appropriate to call the COVID contribution kind of a soft landing, so to speak, that it's not going to drop off, it's just going to slowly taper over time. Is that the right way to think about it?
Ari Bousbib: On the R&DS business, absolutely. No question. What you said is exactly what I would say. It's a soft landing '22, '23, and it -- frankly, we get lost in the rounding, by the time we get to '23. Unless, of course, it's not complete. There is another variant or another COVID. But right now, as we see based on what we know today, it's a soft landing, we get lost in the rounding by '23.
Operator: Your last question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.
Dan Leonard: Can you comment on trial site operations? Are there any continued bottlenecks you flag? Or is site activity normalizing?
Ari Bousbib: Ron?
Ron Bruehlman : Yes. Look, the site accessibility numbers remain around 80% or so. But look, we've managed to work around that and operate it close to normal. And not all sites are equal, the larger sites are open, and that hasn't been an issue for us. We've seen site start-ups and patient recruitment at near pre-pandemic levels, not quite, but near pre-pandemic levels. The patient visits are still lagging a little bit. just gradually coming back. And so when we look at our overall operations, we're not totally back to pre-pandemic level yet and we'll expect a gradual improvement over time back to pre-pandemic level, but it really hasn't been a major issue for our operations. As Ari mentioned in his opening remarks, we've learned how to manage driving around the...
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean the numbers that -- I got the numbers here in detail, but basically, we're over between -- it's 80% or so across all of those metrics. A little bit higher for site start-up, which is more -- again, as a percentage of 2019 base levels, okay? So site startup is a little higher, is that more 85% or thereabouts globally. The bottom line is these metrics that we see provide confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as you can see from the strong bookings, but it's also starting to be delivered. And the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are ongoing. So I think there hasn't been any major change from this as a result of the new variant or anything like that.
Dan Leonard: And as a follow-up, Ari, can you comment on perceived market share trends in R&DS in the quarter? You've been pretty open about the various strategic actions by your competitors potentially allowing an opportunity for share gain.
Ari Bousbib: Look, it's hard to look at market share in a given quarter. Okay? It's lumpy trial, it can be awarded the quarter or the first or the following. I wouldn't look at -- we like -- as we always say, look, we've -- we were defeated and gave you quarterly book-to-bill ratios. But really, we don't -- we believe we should focus on longer-term book-to-bill ratios because it's lumpy and focus also on business from the backlog over the next 12 months. Now if you look at our competitors, there's been a lot of disruption. And yes, I mean, we've had conversations with customers, but just as we do to win a new customer overnight, you don't throw out a CRO overnight or in the middle of trials, right? So some of those mergers will have an impact on market share. I think it's favorable to us. Maybe we remain the last CRO standing, I don't know. But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the underlying business. There's all of disruptions, there's -- people lose their jobs, people who don't like the new arrangement, and that's just life. And the result of that is some market share. We had that problem after our merger in '16. Let's be honest about it, then we have some market share issues which we rebounded once we put together the company and integrated. I think we are -- the future is very bright for us. We continue to gain new customers. And the biotech environment in particular, is extremely, extremely hot right now. We are gaining new clients. In Europe, we're making inbounds with the customers we never had before. In Asia as well, and the teams are extremely energized and I think we are on a winning momentum here and no doubt that when we look back, we will see that our market share has improved.
Nick Childs: Can -- this is going to be our last question of the day.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Ari, maybe a follow-up on that last question. You talked a little bit about kind of all the mergers going on in the space, again, headcount disruption. Following up on one of the earlier questions in terms of labor costs, does that position you guys better in terms of being able to acquire some talent that got modeled around during some of these mergers, kind of being a stable shift there and kind of grab some people, maybe not quite the inflationary costs you're seeing on the labor side? And then secondarily to that, maybe with a focus on R&Ds. How much can you pass some of these price increases on to customers? I know full-service contracts and backlog are particularly tough to adjust. But just wondering how much you can pass on in terms of some so the price pressure you're getting there?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well, on the personnel question, you've got to differentiate between the executive management leadership level and then the actual field force with CRAs, et cetera. So on the first group, in general, the first category, yes, there is an opportunity to bringing challenge that somehow dissatisfied with where they are and that will only occur and it has happened already in a few cases. But again, these are small numbers. On the CRAs and the project lead and so on, that's much more difficult because it's driven by the book of business and by the execution that our competitors are also in the midst of trials and they need those people as much as we do. And so there's not much -- there's just an inflation on wages, which is the result of all the factors we talked about before, but that doesn't -- the mergers don't affect at least immediately the CRAs and the people in the field. Your other question had to do
Patrick Donnelly: With pricing. And do we need a passing on cost.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So as you noted yourself in your question, it's very hard. You can't -- we sold projects with certain assumptions. And there are some escalations and some factors built into those contracts. So that will be reflected. But by and large, the pricing was set based on different assumptions and when you have higher cost, then you have to absorb. But then as we move forward, obviously, the pricing is affected. There's no magic here. It's all going to get fast on and there's no secret. But it's going to lag because of the nature of our business, certainly in the R&DS business.
Ron Bruehlman : Right. And of course, on the TAS side of the business, shorter-cycle business, a greater ability to pass along cost increases.
Ari Bousbib: Right, but there's less labor. So that's..
Ron Bruehlman : Less labor. correct.
Nick Childs: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at our Investor Day in a few weeks. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to reach out. We're happy to answer them. Thanks for joining today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.
Nicholas Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Brian Stengel [ph], Associate Director, Investor Relations.  Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.  Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today. This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V 22 financial plan.  The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year.  And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year.  During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic.  We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond.  As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V 22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available.  With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs.  Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.  Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business. It once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in realtime. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites.  Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights.  Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE.  Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite.  By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment and reduce costs.  Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs.  Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year.  I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investments for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing.  Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early- and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter.  I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency.  Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency.  R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 44.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency.  CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency.  And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share.  Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year.  Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.  Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 billion -- million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results.  In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program.  And now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth.  Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digits.  You saw that we also raised our profit guidance. As a result of the stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%.  Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%.  Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half.  Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter.  So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.  So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: I have two questions. Ron, first, congrats on the great cash flow performance year-to-date. I'm just hoping you can give us some more details on where you're making the biggest gains, changes supporting these improvements? And any color commentary on your outlook for the future?  Second question, just COVID-related. It's the typical standard ask: if you could give any insights on COVID revenue in the quarter, bookings, backlog, thoughts on the tail end of 2022, that would be helpful as well.
Ronald Bruehlman: Sure. To your first question, Eric, on cash flow, there are two principal drivers of our strong cash flow performance. The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections.  The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year. I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance back in 2000 -- I guess, in '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally, bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think we'll continue to pay dividends.  We also remember had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid- to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down, depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance.  The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense.  And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeting specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less, way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.  So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact are really not significant.
Ronald Bruehlman: Well, look, even if you were -- on the revenue side, if you were to pull out all of the COVID-related work, we still have very strong revenue growth, double-digit revenue growth in both the TAS segment and the R&DS segment. So yes, COVID was a contributor in the quarter, but the underlying non-COVID-related work was growing strongly also. And of course, COVID is the reality these days. It's part of the business. We want to participate in that work, and we have been participating in that work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I have two questions. One is more of a housekeeping thing. Ron, maybe you could provide the precise organic revenue growth? metrics for each segment, TAS and R&DS.  And then secondly, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what Ari started out with in terms of the growth in the real-world evidence business. What's the size of the business at this point in time? What was the growth in the quarter? How is that contributing to the overall business growth? And just more detail, it seems like that's a significant differentiator for IQVIA versus a lot of the competition. I thought we could flesh some of that out.
Ronald Bruehlman: Let me take the first question, Shlomo, on organic growth. The contribution of acquisitions in the quarter to our revenue growth was insignificant. If you look back over the past number of quarters, you can see our acquisition activity tailed off quite a bit and is only recently beginning to pick back up. So there's almost no contribution whatsoever of acquisitions to our growth. So organic growth, for all intents and purposes, equals reported growth in those segments.
Nicholas Childs: Yes. And then, Shlomo, on the real-world side, that business is about $1 billion. As we've talked about before, continues to grow double digits. This quarter was high double digits again. Continue to see very, very strong results in that business and continue to deliver for us and drive the pass-through.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger: Maybe just a quick follow-up on real-world evidence. I think prior -- previously, this year, you'd talked about doing some significant government COVID tracking work, but that was expected to tail off. What are your current thoughts about the durability of that program? And sort of what are you assuming in your guidance for the year?
Nicholas Childs: John, we're expecting that work to continue through the balance of the year, but it will be less contribution in the second half than the first half. We'll see whether it continues on into 2023 or not. That sort of work tends to be pretty quick burn and rapidly changing, but we do expect some incremental contribution from the government COVID-related work through the balance of the year. Think particular, when you get into the fourth quarter, the compare to last year's fourth quarter when we had a substantial amount of it is going to be negative. But you see overall, for our implied fourth quarter guidance, that it remains very strong for the company as a whole.
John Kreger: Ron, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up. Can you guys just talk a little bit about the staffing environment? We hear a lot about labor shortage. Just curious if you're seeing any constraints in your ability to recruit and hire and if that's driving any pressure on margins.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Look, it's no secret that given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously strong competition for talent. And it's also no secret that when people need highly qualified talent, they come after IQVIA talent because they know we train people well, and we've got a broad range of skills and training programs. So -- however, we are confident that we'll continue to be able to attract and retain the talent, simply because we are the premier company in the industry and also, frankly, because we've been investing in our employees, especially during the pandemic. We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continue to pay our people well.  Now does it cause a certain amount of anxiety in the industry? And yes, it's true. And has it caused some level of wage inflation? Yes, that is true. There is also a little bit of an uptick in attrition levels as a consequence of all of that. All of that is true. But again, we feel confident. We do not anticipate this to cause any significant -- there will be some level of headwind to our margins, but we have so many programs and productivity measures and process improvement measures in place that we are confident we will overrun. And you could see that our margins have been performing very well and growing faster than we had anticipated.
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. John, obviously, any cost pressure we're feeling is fully baked into our 2021 guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Ari, on the 16.7% backlog growth, I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color. How much of this, in your view, is kind of pent-up demand, catch-up work? And then any kind of lingering concerns around site accessibility and the variant potentially impacting conversion in the back half of the year?
Ari Bousbib: Well, obviously, you've got a compare issue quarter-over-quarter that's driving some of that -- those just unusually high growth rates. But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth. Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work. So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported.  Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility. We also believe we are at a -- some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels.  So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS.
Tycho Peterson: That's helpful. And then for a follow-up, 2 quick ones. I'm wondering if you can update us on the orchestrated clinical trial rollout, how that's going. And then separately, on the acquisitions. I understand they're not big revenue contributors. I'm just curious if the accretion assumptions have changed. I think you've previously talked about $0.12 accretion from the Q2 acquisition. I just want to make sure that's still case.
Ari Bousbib: You ask about decentralized, right?
Ronald Bruehlman: That's what's -- okay.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. That, we'll see here. Yes. Again, on the acquisition, just to clarify, on the 40% acquisition of the minority Q2 of the lab that we didn't own, there was 0 impact on revenue and EBITDA since we already consolidated as we were 60% owner. But there was this accretion on -- there's accretion on the bottom line. And all of the accretion, you have the exact number for the base -- for Q2?
Ronald Bruehlman: $0.12.
Ari Bousbib: For the balance of the year?
Ronald Bruehlman: For the balance of the year. We put that into our guidance.
Ari Bousbib: That's in the guidance?
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes.
Ari Bousbib: That was already done.
Ronald Bruehlman: That was already done.
Ari Bousbib: By the time. Nothing has changed on -- now I'm not clear on your first question. Was it about the centralized trials, about OCT?
Tycho Peterson: It was about the orchestrated clinical trials, OCT, the suite launch and how that's going.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Fine. So that's going well. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that every single one of our -- of the top 10 pharma clients is using 1 module of our clinical technology suite and 18 of the top 20. So we are gaining ground and making progress. The -- essentially all of the suites have been launched and most modules are being used, and the sales pipeline continues to increase. We see a lot of interest from our clients for the platform itself and also for individual or suites stand-alone modules. We're seeing interest from all customer segments. I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid- and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business. The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is -- the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vaccine issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources. So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.
Jack Meehan: Ari, I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on the progress of OCE to now 109 clients. What's the revenue base for this business? And where do you think you are in the growth curve? Is it still in investment mode? Or has the business turned profitable at this point?
Ari Bousbib: Right. I don't think we disclosed how much it represents. But we've said that so far in 2021, we've had 19 client wins, which brings the total since launch, 3.5 years ago, to 159 client wins. We continue to have a disproportionate share of the wins. I think it's 2 out of 3, and that has been consistent. We are performing well with the large pharma deployments, which we have talked about. I think Roche already has 15,000-or-so users in deployment. So we haven't seen any slowdown in the implementation as a result of COVID other than isolated issues, which we dealt with. We even see some deployments that are -- that have accelerated time lines. So the feedback is overall positive. The field reps are very engaged. All is going better than planned for the launch of OCE, which I remind you, was only 3.5 years ago.
Jack Meehan: Great. And then you started by talking about the strength of the funding environment and the VC activity going on. I was wondering if you're seeing any themes emerge from a therapeutic area perspective and how you thought IQVIA was stacked up for that. And one specific area I was hoping you could weigh in on is Alzheimer's and just whether you think that's an area where you could see new investment coming in.
Ari Bousbib: I think, look, the -- undoubtedly, the area where we see the most funding is oncology, especially those subcategories of oncology where it's been difficult to have effective drugs. So people are pouring a lot of VC funds into oncology.  CNS is another area. And Alzheimer's, yes, we've got quite a few things going on there. Cardiovascular, strong growth as well. So I would say these are the -- and of course, immunology, prompted by what happened with the virus and COVID. There's a lot of interest in immunology, and that also, I would say, is the fourth main area of funding.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.
Daniel Leonard: So hoping, first, you could elaborate a bit more on your decentralized trial offering and maybe update specifically on Study Hub trends.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, as we mentioned, the decentralized trial opportunity was identified well before COVID. We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development. Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate. We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process. We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to -- from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time, sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase. We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many, a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability. And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers. Given the very strong growth that we have, it's not materializing. Ron, do you want to add...
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. Just to put some numbers around what Ari just said, I think we had 81 trials now that are fully deployed on Study Hub. And there's approaching 250 trials or so that have some piece of Study Hub. And at any given point in time, we'll have close to 1,000 full-service clinical trials going on. So it's a piece of our business -- it's a growing piece of our business, but still not the majority of what we're doing.
Daniel Leonard: Okay. That's very thorough and helpful. And just a quick follow-up to Jack's question earlier. Possible -- I'm curious if you could frame and size the Alzheimer's opportunity for IQVIA. I remember when something had to come out of backlog a couple of years ago, it was rather sizable and been wondering how sizable things coming into backlog could be.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I don't think it's -- listen, at the time, our bottle was much smaller. When we came out, it was sizable, but it -- we didn't -- it was, like, seamless. We never felt it. It was not an issue at all, neither when it left nor when it came back partially. So I'm not sure what you're referring to. It's not significant. I don't if we disclosed that, but it's not -- it wouldn't be material and would be in the rounding given the size of our backlog.
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. The current Alzheimer's contribution of our backlog is not material. Now could there be more coming in the future? Sure, we hope there is, but we'll see.
Operator: Your next question comes from line Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Ari, you touched on M&A a little bit, and obviously, the cash flow performance, where the leverage is. Can you just talk about kind of the landscape, what the pipeline looks like? Obviously, a lot of activity in the space. And then secondarily, given some of the mergers and movements around the space, are you seeing any disruption opportunity for share gains? Any commentary from customers suggesting this is an opportunity for you guys at the moment?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean the latter part of your question refers to the consolidation. And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's, well into the long term, going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to -- are in search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry. In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that -- first of all, we don't need to "participate." Obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been shopped to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend. It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity overlap. Now the consolidation has taken place thus provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is, generally, a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true. Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work. Other acquisitions, obviously, we're looking at things. As always, there's a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that.
Patrick Donnelly: No. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. CSMS doesn't get the most airtime, but it's nice to see the recovery ongoing. I think you bumped guidance from low single-digit declines to low single-digit growth. Can you just talk about the market recovery going on there and the outlook?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth. But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small. Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore, we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business, where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days. Okay. Last question, Nick?
Nicholas Childs: Last one, yes.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line with Sandy Draper with Truist Securities.
Alexander Draper: This should be a pretty quick one. Ron, just when I look at the third quarter guidance, looking down sequentially, I just want to confirm, I would assume most of that is because of an expected decline in pass-through revenue and R&D. Is anything else...
Ronald Bruehlman: Yes. That's really the driver. You're correct, Sandy.
Alexander Draper: Okay. That's my question. Congrats.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, guys.
Nicholas Childs: That's it. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again on our third quarter call. Me and this team will be available later for any follow-up calls you -- follow-up questions you might have and look forward to talking to you. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Casey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are, Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis, and newcomer for this call, Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations and Bryan has succeeded [indiscernible] HealthTech. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib : Good morning everyone and thank you, Andrew. Welcome and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter results with strong double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and as a result of this performance and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we have once again raised our guidance. The 2021 guidance that we provided to you last quarter was already within reach of our original pre-COVID plans for 2021. Our revised guidance today significantly exceed those original plans. In many ways, 2020 was a reset year for our company and also for the industry. We've been saying for a long time that the traditional timelines for the development of new drugs are too long. The speed at which COVID vaccines were developed in 2020 has obviously raised the bar in terms of what expectations should be. The crisis accelerated the adoption of new technologies and we believe it will force a lasting change in how innovative medicines are developed and commercialize. All of this has made IQVIA even more relevant to our clients and has highlighted the power of our differentiated offerings. The deep client engagements that we had during the pandemic demonstrated how uniquely positioned we are to bring new insights and expertise that can improve drug development and commercial fine lines. What is also becoming clear is that there is a lot of pent-up demand due to one, the many trials that were slowed down or temporary pushed to the right and two, the trials that did not get started as they were crowded out by the COVID resolution efforts on which everyone was focused. These pent-up demand across therapy areas, combined with record levels of biotech funding provides a very strong backdrop for our industry. As a result of these favorable conditions, we've started the process of revisiting our Vision 2022 goals. We plan to update you later this year on our Vision 2022 progress and lay the groundwork for the next phase of our journey. We may do this at an Investor Conference later this year, especially if we are able to hold one in-person, so stay tuned for more information. For now, let's review the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 24% on reported basis and 21% at constant currency was $209 million above the high end of our guidance range. About half of these beats came from strong operational performance and half was from higher pass-throughs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 32% reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $69 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18 grew 45%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. A little bit more color on the business. Our commercial technology presence continues to grow as we launch new offerings in the market. During the quarter, a top 10 pharma client deployed our next best action solution in 14 countries. This tool is a SaaS-based technology platform that optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. It increases the success of their marketing activities by providing automated sales call recommendations for the field based on advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Our base OCE and CRM win rate remained strong. We added another 10 new clients this quarter and now have 150 clients deploying about 70,000 users. Our eCOA technology platform or electronic clinical outcomes assessment tool, which is used by our Real World as well as R&DS teams is also experiencing strong demand. This cloud-based platform utilizes a user-friendly interface to collect clinical data directly from patients. We launched this solution during 2019 and the team is seeing strong user acceptance. To date, we've been awarded over 125 studies with over 300,000 patients enrolled and over 4 million surveys completed. Moving now to R&DS. We continue to build on our strong bookings momentum in our R&DS business. In the first quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.41 excluding pass-throughs. At March 31, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.52 including pass-throughs and 1.45 excluding pass-throughs. These numbers are all the more impressive obviously given our strong revenue growth. Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 18.3% year-over-year to $23.2 billion at March 31, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased by over $600 million sequentially to $6.5 billion that's up 31.1% year-over-year. The R&DS team is building on the success we experienced in 2020 with our hybrid virtual trial offering or [indiscernible] now decentralized trials. In the first quarter, we won decentralized trials in new therapeutic areas including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. We are working with 5 of the top 10 pharma clients and to date, we've recruited almost 170,000 patients using our advanced decentralized trial solution. Finally, you saw that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q Squared Solutions from QUEST Diagnostics. As you know, Q Squared is an industry-leading laboratory service provider for clinical trials with global capabilities across safety, bioanalytical, vaccine, genomics and bioanalytical testing along with best-in-class technology in bio specimen and consent lifecycle management. These transactions streamline strategic decision making for us and gives us the flexibility to build our greater bioanalytical, genomic and bio market capability, as we see increased attractive growth opportunities in this expanding market. With that I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman : Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. As Ari mentioned, this is a very strong quarter. I would start first by giving you some more detail on revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.409 billion grew 23.8% on a reported basis and 21.4% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.348 billion, which was up 20.7% reported and 17.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions, first quarter revenue of $1.868 billion improved 29.6% at actual FX rate and 28.1% at constant currency. Pass-through revenues were a tailwind of 770 basis points to the R&DS revenue growth rate in the quarter. CSMS revenue of $193 million were down 1.5% reported and 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $744 million for the quarter, representing growth of 32.4%. Margins expanded on 140 basis points despite significant headwinds from higher pass-through revenue and lower margin COVID work. GAAP net income was $212 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.9. Adjusted net income was $425 million for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 45.3% to $2.18. R&D Solutions delivered another exceptional quarter of net new business, backlog was up 18.3% year-over-year at $23.2 billion at March 31. Next 12 months' revenue was already mentioned from backlog grew significantly and currently stands at $6.5 billion, up 31.1% year-over-year and of course this metric now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is a further indication that we see the momentum of the business continuing beyond this year. Now, let us review the balance sheet. At March 31, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion and debt was $12.2 billion resulting in net debt of $9.9 billion. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA marking the first time since just following the merger that this ratio was below 4 times and this is particularly noteworthy, you may recall that in 2019, when we gave you our 3-year guidance, we committed to deleverage to 4 turns or below exiting 2022. We are pleased to have achieved this target entering 2021. First quarter cash flow, free cash flow in particular with very strong cash flow from operations was $867 million, CapEx was $149 million, resulting in free cash flow of $718 million. We repurchased $50 million of our shares in the quarter. Which leaves us with $867 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. You'll recall that back on April 1 when we announced the acquisition of QUEST 40% interest in our Q Squared joint venture, we raised our 2021 EPS guidance by $0.12 to reflect the elimination of QUEST minority interest in the joint venture's earnings. We wrapped revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance unchanged, of course because we already consolidated the financials for the joint venture prior to the transaction. Well, today we're revising our guidance upward again as follows. We are raising our full-year 2021 revenue guidance, both at the low and the high end of the range resulting in an increase of $625 million at the midpoint of the range. The new revenue guidance is $13.200 billion to $13.500 billion, which represents a year-over-year growth of 16.2% to 18.8%. This increased guidance range reflects the first quarter strength and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business and also absorbed FX headwind versus our previous guidance. Now compared to the prior year, FX is expected to be a tailwind of about 150 basis point the full-year revenue growth. From a segment perspective, we now expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow at a low- to mid-teens percentage rate and R&D Solutions to grow in the low- to mid-20s. Our previous expectations that revenue in the CSMS business would be slightly down remains unchanged. We're also raising our full-year profit guidance. As a result of stronger revenue outlook, we've increased it pre-adjusted EBITDA guidance at both the low and high end of the range resulting in an increase of $133 million at the midpoint. Our new full-year guidance, it's $2.900 billion to $2.955 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 21.6% to 24.4%. During the EPS, I mentioned the Q Squared transaction on April 1, as a result of that, we raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 to a new range of $7.89 to $8.20. We are now raising both the low and the high end of that guidance range, resulting in a new adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.75 or year-over-year growth of 32.4% to 36.3%. Little bit of detail on the P&L interest expense is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year, operational depreciation and amortization is still expected to be somewhat over $400 million and we're continuing to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the full year. This guidance assumes that a current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now let's turn to the second quarter guidance, assuming FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.225 billion to $3.300 billion which represents reported growth of 27.9% to 30.9%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $690 million and $715 million, which represents reported growth of 42.9% or 48.0% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2 and $2.10, up 69.5% to 78%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results, once again reporting double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. This included revenue growth of over 20% in both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS backlog improved to $23.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Next 12-month revenue from that backlog increased to $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Free cash flow was strong again this quarter, net leverage improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and finally, given the strong momentum we see in the business, we are once again raising our full-year guidance for revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Before we open the call up for Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of a couple of leadership changes within IQVIA finance organization. Andrew Markwick who has led our Investor Relations function for the past 4 years and very capably, I think you'll agree, is moving on to come CFO of the R&DS unit. Nick Childs, who currently runs our Corporate FP&A function will take over as SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Nick has been and as well for over 3 years and has a very deep knowledge of the company in our financials and he will be succeeded by Mike Fedock who has served as CFO of the R&DS unit for the past 2 years. Finally, those of you on the fixed income side, know that Andrew has also served as our treasurer for the past couple of years and Manny Korakis who is our Corporate Controller will also assume leadership of the treasury function going forward. Now, rest assured, Andrew will stay around for a few days to finish up the quarter and take all your questions and to assure a smooth transition to both Nick and Manny. And with that, let me hand it back over to Casey, who will open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Great, Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Robert Jones: Great, good morning. Congrats to everyone and especially, Andrew, hopefully, we will still get to communicate and you will miss having to talk to all of us all the time. I was going to ask already about the long-term guidance, but I think it sounds like, I can anticipate the answer will be wait till later this year. Obviously, the updated revenue guidance today, it looks like it's a CAGR of 9% to 10% off of 19, so it sounds like, if I heard you right, we'll get more on that later. So instead, maybe I'll just go back to a bigger industry question around M&A, Ron, you mentioned getting the leverage below the target that you guys had set out and clearly there is a ton of activity in this space right now. So, I'm curious as you look at the business and you look at some of the movement around you in the space in what your competitors are doing, do you feel like there are capabilities that you really need to go out and buy to enhance or build out what you're already doing or do you think IQVIA is in a pretty formidable competitive standpoint where it is today?
Ari Bousbib : All right, well Robert, lots of questions here, and I would not mind that your long-term question either, but the reason why we think we need to update our long-term guidance, as you will recall in June 2019, we shared our three-year planning process and the goals that we set for ourselves, we had called both on the topline and on the productivity measures and the continued efforts to re-engineer the company and make it more efficient and we set some targets in terms of top line and bottom line growth at the time. Now, obviously, lot has happened, 2020 as I said in my introductory remarks was a largely a reset year; and therefore, we feel it's appropriate to pause and update you on the progress we've made and look -- I think [indiscernible] likely grow through those numbers in 2022 to give you some more precision. We feel that we need to complete our planning process and then when we are ready later this year, we hopefully have an investor conference similar to what we had in June 2019 and then update 2022 and obviously try to give you the sense for the new maybe 2025 targets. So that's what the long-term strategy and goals. With respect to M&A activity in the sector, look we are not surprised, since, the merger that the IMS and Quintiles back in 2016, now we are approaching the fifth year anniversary, a lots of activity has occurred, we believe strong into reactions to what we did. We disturbed and disrupted the industry, which was the goal of the merger, we believe we are accomplishing the goals we have set for ourselves at the time. We believe this strategy was right, the strategic rationale was right and hence the flurry of activity to try to acquire those capabilities any way possible. And that barring the ability to acquire those technology data and analytics capabilities, then CROs are compelled to either sell themselves or merge, and that's all I'll say on what's happening. With respect to our own M&A activity, we've said before that we were interested in deploying capital to acquire strategically compelling companies that added capabilities, we've done that mostly in the technology area to accelerate the growth of our technology business and the acquisition of those capabilities. We will of course look every time that in assets that is within our businesses is to tap for sale and you probably all know with those have been or are and we look and we do the work in every case we are fast so far. So that's all I will say, I mean, we've said before that we have -- look we have a lot of liquidity, right. We have now between the $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and 1.5 billion of untapped revolver capacity that's $3.8 billion, obviously we used $760 million of that on April 1 for the acquisition of the minority stake in the lab business which we are very, very excited about. And so we have a little over $3 billion of cash on that deployable, and we would rather spend it A, on internal development; B, on strategic acquisitions and barring all of that, we would invest the balance of available cash by redistributing to shareholders via share repurchase as we've done historically.
Andrew Markwick : Thanks, Robert.
Robert Jones: Thanks, Ari.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. A lot of things we could hit on here, but I know I'm going to get inbounds on the COVID stats for the quarter in the year. If you'll bear with me on this, I know it gets laborious but would it be possible if -- sorry if I missed it to update the number of the trials you've been awarded to date in COVID, any insights into the percent of revenue in Q1 or your outlook for the year related specifically to COVID vaccines or therapeutics, maybe something on the percent of backlog that is represented by COVID or any comments on the pipeline of activity around COVID studies that would be great. Thank you so much.
Ari Bousbib : Thank you, Eric. So look on the number of trials, I have no collection of the number of trials, I can tell you though the most relevant impacts from COVID are obviously the COVID vaccine trials, which are large and fast burning as you know, and so that's really what moves the needle. We've got a lots of a small COVID-related activity all around the company, but that doesn't move the needle, what moves the needle are these COVID vaccine trials and as you know of the five Phase 3 large vaccine trials funded by Operation Warp Speed, we've had work on four of them. Now, we haven't done the full clinical trial on all four of them. We've done it on two of them and the other one is on the third one, we've got the pharmacovigilance work and on the other one, we have the lab work. So those are the ones that have had the most impact. With respect to the impact on the first quarter excluding these work, R&DS revenue grew mid-teens. So that's the impact in the first quarter. What was your other question -- that you also pointed out that the COVID work has had an impact on the first quarter growth as for the forecast as well. As you know, we've said that on previous earnings calls, we've had demand from governments around the world, in the US, the FDA, in Europe, in Asia as well and those have also provided high growth in the first quarter. Without those activities, the cash revenue growth would have been in the high single digits. So, roughly, I think you could say that COVID contributed all these large fast burning COVID work and it also contributed about half of the total company revenue growth. What was your question on the, I guess on the R&DS backlog you asked. What it is as a portion of the backlog? If I recall, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, if we look at the service backlog in R&DS, it is in the high single digits.
Andrew Markwick : Yes, that's correct.
Ari Bousbib : Yes. So that's what it represents. Now, it does have a much longer tail than we would have thought. It is certain it is going to remain with us through 2021 and well into 2022. There are many reasons for that. There are many vaccines for multiple manufacturers that are being developed to meet global demand. We are still responding to RFPs for vaccines around the world in many other countries that want to develop their own vaccines. There are follow-up studies for adapting the vaccines for the mutations of the virus. There are alternative versions of the vaccine that will be needed in case of adverse safety events or in case of quality and manufacturing issues and then there are bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations, specific conditions and then there is a lot of safety monitoring work, that is also in the pipe. So again, the first point that I understand, the context of your question the COVID-related work is not going away anytime soon, and is here for a while, we're very happy that we have our fair share of that market. What I also should say because I know if you didn't ask the question, you're going to ask it soon that the RFP pipeline across the board is very strong, well beyond COVID. In fact, our pipeline of qualified RFPs is approaching $25 billion if I remember correctly.
Andrew Markwick : 23.
Ari Bousbib : 23, okay. It's over $23 billion and it's growing double-digits, both in volume and in value. Again, bear in mind, as I said in my introductory remarks that the work that should have happened in 2020 on all of those other trials that were either about to start or starting all in flight, lots of it was kind of slowed down or pushed to the right. So because of that we've got that pent-up demand that's coming out. And Number 2, lots of projects that normally would have come in will displace, crowded out by the efforts that everyone puts on trying to resolve the COVID situation and so all of that is coming through, and we are confident that both because the COVID work is not going the way in a sharp manner. And number 2, because we've got all of these other activity, there has been bubbling up. We are confident in our guidance for this year and continued strong momentum for the business well beyond COVID.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks, Ari.
Andrew Markwick : Thank you, I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Ari, if you don't mind, I'm going to try and slip in a few. First, I want to ask you if you could talk a little bit about the Real World evidence trends and update us and how that's going that's been a very strong growing in the past. Number 2, just wanted to ask you for a little bit more detail on how you accelerate the growth in net Q2 business by owning all of it. And then finally, I mean how do you do an encore for a quarter like this. I mean can you talk about the discussion about the business momentum, continuing it's such a strong quarter it's hard to believe that you'll be able to improve the partners and I know I've asked a lot but going to kind of put them out there.
Ari Bousbib : Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we are not suggesting we are going to have the 25% growth or whatever that we showed here on the ongoing basis that's not the normal all these and I will explain why, in response to Eric question was a little back of that large fast burning vaccine work for COVID had on our business. Now, excluding all of that, the business has strong momentum. You will recall, we gave guidance for where we wanted to get as a company. By the end of 2022, when we faced high single digits was going to be a new normal where we believe we are going to be above that excluding all of the disruption and the unusual bubbles. So, again excluding that fast burning work that we had in the first quarter, the R&DS business grew mid double-digits and the TAS business grew high single digits excluding the COVID related work. So that is very, very comfortable with. The rest of the year obviously would be higher than that again because we have the trailing impact of COVID we think one into 2022 and the pent-up demand that needs to be caught up. So, all of that helps build momentum. With respect to your specific question on Real World, it is strong double-digit growth in Q1. I mentioned all the -- we spoke last time about the care registry for the FDA. We spoke about the patient monitoring efforts, the deployment of our advance, we now have over a 1 billion patient lives in our database and we've continued to [indiscernible] platform for clients with the deploying our eCOA platform, which helps collect clinical data directly from patients. We are seeing extremely strong demand on Real World, obviously this is just getting started now that we are seeing demand to track patient populations in terms of people who had the virus in terms of surveilling patients that actually took the vaccines and monitoring for potential adverse effects, etcetera. So, all of that plays right smack in the center of both our capabilities are in Real World.
Andrew Markwick : Thank you, Shlomo.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
John Kreger: Thanks very much. Hey Ari, just maybe a follow-up, I think last quarter you talked about your assumption within TAS, you assumed RWE COVID work would really sort of fall off I think in the second quarter. Do you still feel that way or do you think this is going to continue to be strong throughout the year?
Ari Bousbib : Yes, I mean, look, it's going to continue longer than we expected that's why I said in response to an earlier question, we were not assuming that we would continue at the time and that was the basis of our guidance for the year. The reason we are updating the guidance and increasing it so much is A, to reflect the performance in the first quarter -- the over performance but also to reflect our revised expectation that this work is going to continue for the balance of the year. It will not be at the same level as it was in the first quarter or the fourth quarter and will gradually start declining, but -- it is still significant for the balance of the year and importantly into 2022.
John Kreger: And Ron, a question for you. I believe gross margin year-over-year was down something like 90 basis points. Was that I'll driven by the higher pass-throughs in R&DS?
Ron Bruehlman : Yes, I still think it's a higher pass-throughs in R&DS and some of the COVID work is inherently a little bit low in margin in some of the other work. So those are the key reasons.
Ari Bousbib : But our operating margins are up.
Ron Bruehlman : Yes, our operating margins are up, our EBITDA margins up 140 basis points in the quarter, so despite that overall very strong performance, obviously at the leverage of the higher volumes and we didn't increase cost accordingly.
John Kreger: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to go back to one of the original question just on the M&A in the space you've got three competitors now all tied up with mergers. I'm just curious, what are you hearing from customers, how do you think about the opportunity to maybe pick up share in environment where there is a lot of distraction in churn. Can you maybe just talk to those dynamics?
Ari Bousbib : Okay. you look, whatever I say here is just we know opinions and the little bit of an educated set of observations based on, as you said, improve some clients and being having our fingers on the pulse of the industry. Look, we were already gaining share and we're not counting on others to be weaker than they were in order to gain share. We are largely, our market share gains, which I think are evident are the result of our unique differentiated capabilities and offerings. So, that's number one. We don't spend that much time roofing at what other people do in the industry. We focus on our strategy and building out our capabilities and trying to persuade customers that they should go with us and we are successful doing that. Now, If I look out, obviously I can't miss the activity, you will recall that IMC Research and Inventiv merged in order to form Syneos, LabCorp bought Chiltern, PRA bought Symphony Health, ICON is merging with PRA. PPD selling itself to TMO, what else, LabCorp is exploring strategic alternatives, whatever that means. So, a lots of activity and I probably missing some, but generally, in the CRO business, there are very few cases where there is synergy between two CROs, very few cases. If someone is largely present in Phase 1 or preclinical and Phase 1 and somewhat that is stronger in Phase 2, Phase 3 that maybe you could sell this complementarity and value. Someone is very strong in the US, very weak in Asia and someone else is very strong in Asia, very weak in US then you can see there is geographic complementarity, and there is value. But in most cases they're serving the same client base and in many cases including for the people that I just mentioned who are merging, there are clients where the two of them are the preferred providers for applying. So what do you think is going to happen. The client is going to remain with one provider. So, we are going to have negative synergy -- dyssynergy on the revenue side. Yes, you always have cost benefits because you don't need two CEOs, two CFOs, two General Counsel's etcetera, etcetera. But largely, this is a project-based business. You still need a different team for every project. So, the level of scalability as a result of the merger and the efficiency because you put two CROs together is extremely limited. So I don't see that much value there and then don't come back to me if I have -- we are buying CRO and telling why you are buying the CRO. Again, that could be cases where it does make sense again because the complementarity are indeed complementary or because the customer coverage is complementary, etcetera. So again, we want to focus on what we do. Clearly, the company in a merger situation is weakened, we experienced it ourselves. Despite the fact that we were doing a merger between two totally different companies that we're bringing very rich capabilities to each other, but the merger, no doubt about it, is disruptive, the sale is disruptive, balance, fees, we've experienced it, so we know what is going to happen. Obviously, each an opportunity for us. Again, we're not counting on that, we are gaining share regardless.
Andrew Markwick : Thank you.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then one follow-up, speaking of things you are buying on the Q2 Solutions, I just would like a little more color. I mean you mentioned that streamlines decision making, you can build out greater bio analytical capabilities, but can you just talk a bit more on the rationale for bringing that back in-house and I know you had a question earlier on how you can scale it up, I didn't hear an answer to that as well.
Ari Bousbib : Yes, I mean, look, we owned 60% and was managed jointly we had joint venture, but mostly I think it has been run largely by outside in terms of the management, it fit into the clinical trial process, the companies who put together originally both were relatively weak in this space. It was turned around, improved, it's a strong business, those capabilities are extremely sought after, the market is becoming more and more attractive. There has been back to the M&A question. There are number of a very attractive highly specialized biologic genomics related labs that came up for sale, and we were unable to proceed decision making, ability to focus, etcetera, and all of that I think will be for see it going forward. So, we as a business that we like it's a growth business, is an attractive business and we want to invest in it and when and if there are acquisitions in this space, we would seriously look at them and be able to move faster. Now also compelling in passing that might say it was a financially no-brainer kinds of transactions for us.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks, Ari.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Patrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Ari, maybe just on the OCE business. It's not the biggest piece of revenue yet, but a nice growth opportunity. I think you talked about 10 ads this quarter, can you just talk about how that business is looking in the face of the pandemic, what you're expecting as we go through the rest of the year and just the competitive environment there?
Ari Bousbib : Well, look, we continue to win in the marketplace at about the same pace, I mentioned we had 10 clients win so far in 2021. We have 150 since launch. The large client deployments are going very well, now implementations went well despite the COVID environment last year that will build any slowdowns, in fact some deployments are seeing accelerated timelines, everything is on schedule. I know if you just go to disclose the names of the clients, and now in this business, I'm not sure. The feedback is very positive generally, the field reps are very engaged, way of course the Roche global deployments [indiscernible] international operation, the AstraZeneca U.S. deployment, all of that is largely on target, very good positive feedback, you know that we see is rather revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. It's not just a CRM, it's platformed on force.com and the Lightning platform. It's a very collaborative tool, utilizes AI and machine learning to integrate various functions within the pharma companies, commercial operations, enables faster integration of data and therefore faster deployments. It links the have-to providers and the suite data for a better view of the doctor and all of that again optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. And then since then obviously, we are adding modules that are based on the OCE platform, we've got HCP engagement management, we've got OCE optimizer's, we've got the Next Best Action, all of those are enhancing functional capabilities that our clients are buying and that helps grow the business even faster.
Patrick Donnelly: Great, thanks Ari.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper from Truist Securities, please go ahead, your line is now open.
Sandy Draper: Thanks very much. Just maybe one quick clarification and then a broader one. First one, the comments you made about the growth rates, was that constant currency or is that reported?
Andrew Markwick : Okay Sandy, Yes, the growth rates we've given to the guidance on a reported basis.
Sandy Draper: Okay. So like the low-teens and mid-20s, that was reported. Okay, great.
Ari Bousbib : The FX impact is slightly positive during the course of the year but engagement a big driver and it remains same as the year goes on.
Sandy Draper: Super, that helps. And then maybe more broadly for whoever wants to take it. Obviously business is going really well. As you said Ari, it looks like the target is higher, it seems to me, may be one of the biggest challenges, you're going to have, because you said a lot of this is the service business and obviously some of the software is software can scale, but how do you think about -- do you have to change anything about hiring, think about where you're going for people, are you worried about wage pressure but it's clearly you're going to have to add a lot of people to continue to build to get to the growth you're doing? So we just love your thoughts on hiring wage inflation and how you manage adding that many people in what's a very positive, but also competitive labor market. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib : It's a great, great question, and you know you are touching on one of the obviously the biggest operational challenges we have and that's a natural challenge when you're growing and you're in service industry and you're right, the software-based business or the data subscription business, they are growing, but not at the pace that the services business is growing and in aggregate in relative terms, we are still going to need to hire people. Now two observations, number one, in early 2020 and 2019 early 2020 in anticipation of continued growth, we already had hired a lot of people. We did not restructure people in 2020. We kept people and even while they weren't working and we paid them, they are here and they are now working and delivering. So we haven't had to hire more people as much as you might think relative to our workforce last year and it's part of the reason why we are having nice margin expansion here. Second observation is we talked before about merger of competitors, obviously this is going to lead to some talent bleed and availability and we are in fact being approached and talent there but, Yes, I mean wage inflation that's true across industries and certainly in our industry as well. So we have to deal with that. You know that we have a program to a continue to seek efficiencies, scale whether it's through consolidation of activities, using our offshore centers, automation of processes, etcetera. And we have a lot of programs to create cost efficiencies that again the purpose of which is to continue to be able to deliver margin expansion, even as we've got wage inflation. Ron.
Ron Bruehlman : And one more thing Sandy, anticipated wage inflation is fully factored into our guidance.
Sandy Draper: Yes.
Ron Bruehlman : Sorry Sandy go ahead.
Sandy Draper: No, I just say thanks for taking the question.
Ron Bruehlman : Okay. Thanks Sandy, it was pleasure.
Andrew Markwick : I think we took our time to probably just one more question before we get to the top of the hour.
Operator: Great, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of the Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question and squeezing me in. I must say free cash flow was very strong in the first quarter. I just wanted, how you thought that would continue the piece across the year. I mean obviously last year was extraordinary for variety of reasons, including on the free cash flow front, so I just wanted to see sort of how you guys are thinking about the pace as we move through the rest of the year. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib : Ron?
Ron Bruehlman : Hi. Elizabeth and thanks for the question. Look, we did have very strong cash flow. It's not a coincidence, since the start of the pandemic, we've been focusing a lot on that, on collections, not letting accounts receivable slid past due, we've been successful in working down our overdue and negotiating contracts with better billing terms with customers and you're also seeing, although there has been pressure from the industry from clients to extend billing term that's kind of winding down, there is a one-time impact and then you hit steady state. Now having said that, look cash flow is lumpy, so, I'm not going to promise that we're going to have $700 million of free cash flow every quarter. It tends to go up and down, but we have fundamentally shifted our emphasis on improving cash flow, and you've seen that over the past year. Just as a general guidance, help from the guidance, you would expect free cash flow in an average year be between 80% and 90% of adjusted net income and keep in mind that our adjusted net income is growing quite strong at least. Our cash flow will grow on that basis, but in any given quarter or any given year or even it may differ from that. Cash flow is not like earnings, it is not as smooth, it goes up and down, but yes, we have seen improvement and we expect continued strong cash flow going forward, but expect to normal volatility that any company is going to have in cash flow.
Ari Bousbib : Quarter-to-quarter.
Ron Bruehlman : Quarter-to-quarter, correct.
Andrew Markwick : I think let's try and squeeze in one more quick one as well, before we end.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Dave Windley: Hi, thanks for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Ari, I thought maybe the most impressive important number in the quarter was the $6.5 billion in next 12 months backlog that's such a big sequential increase, I think it's the biggest since you merged and I know you said earlier in the call that it's clearly -- bookings were very strong that layers in, you're rolling forward to the next quarter -- it's an outsized improvement and gives great visibility for the next 12 months and I wondered if there was also something to be read into that either that sites in patient recruitment are opening up and there is a greater comfort level that has -- might see a cooperation on that and/or some of your tools for -- I wondered if you could just add some color to how that outlook is improving so dramatically.
Ari Bousbib : Thanks so much for that question, and, yes, you're absolutely right and your observation there has been a dramatic sequential improvement in our next 12 months revenue growth outlook for the R&DS business by over $600 million and this is the result of our continued strong net new bookings performance as well as again as you pointed out correctly steadily improving clinical trial recovery landscape. Now, by the way this metric of next 12 month, now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is again an encouraging sign. As you also point out continued strength well beyond this year. Now in terms of the improvements that we're seeing in terms of accessibility to sites and so on, so forth; recall that we had in the Q1 earnings call just a year ago, 20% of our size were accessible. In the Q2 call, it was 53%, Q3 was about 70%, Q4 was slightly above 70% and now it's higher than that and trending up as well. I think it's in the 75% and 76% range. Our guidance for 2021 picks many factors into account with respect to next 12 months revenue from the backlog, we do this project by project, right. It's a bottom-up process where we evaluate the expected revenue burn for each project for the next 12 months. So, it's an extremely precise exercise and I think a very relevant measure, an indication of the visibility on our business is going forward. But beyond access to site, the site startup activity is actually above the 2019 level. So site startup activity is a very strong indication of revenue balloon going forward and that's above pre-pandemic levels. Patient recruitment it's -- patient visits same thing very close to pre-pandemic levels and trending up. So, bottom line is these metrics provide a strong confidence that the trial pipeline and I'm talking now about the non-COVID trail pipeline, the one that's being awarded or that was awarded and pushed to the right is starting to be delivered with sites enrolling, patients enrolling and patients visits. So you're absolutely correct and thank you for bringing up the question. I hope that you're going to draw the conclusion.
Dave Windley: I appreciate your pass time a little bit, but that's very, very helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib : Thank you, Dave.
Andrew Markwick : Thanks for the question, Dave. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. The team will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have for the rest of the day. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that e -- that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Now, you may have noticed that when we issued our press release this morning, we inadvertently missed the quarterly P&L due to an administrative issue. We apologize for this error. This P&L will be made available in our slide presentation and that will be posted to our website momentarily. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s business, which are discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. We will review how we close 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance. I’m pleased to report we finished the year with a very strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and once again reported results above our financial targets. This is although more remarkable since last year’s fourth quarter was so strong. As you know, through all these difficulties here and as we navigated through the pandemic, we try to be as transparent as possible and provide visibility to our expected financial performance. In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction would normally be to withdraw guidance and watch from the sidelines, but as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw. We did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide our 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual. Today, this outlook has become clearer and we’ve decided to update and raise that guidance. Let’s start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range. A little over 70% of these beats came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11 grew 21.3%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA dropped through. Our strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020. A little bit more color on those achievements starting with technology. Demand for our technology offerings remained strong in 2020. 60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch. As you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deployment of OCE in the U.S. This client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams, namely, there are almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide. This same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP engagement management platform. We launched this platform during 2020. HCP engagement management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations. In addition to HCP engagement management, you will have seen that during 2020 we also launched OCE Optimizer. OCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans. Switching to our real world business, our real world business has been relatively well-insulated from the impact of the virus and it has strong growth for the year. The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which help the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic. Our rich clinical data assets are key to our real world differentiation. The team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active non-identified patients globally, and the team is busy integrating this rich clinical data into research. In 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID active research experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population. We are leveraging this platform along with our vast experience of registries and analytics to partner with the FDA to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID. This work will help identify with symptoms individuals experience, the length and severity of symptoms and whether any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms. It’s a perfect application of our real world capabilities. Similarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to assist various governments and healthcare authorities with large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients. This new series of offerings, which leverages our connected capabilities contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment. Moving to R&DS. As you know, the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. We’ve been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including four of the five vaccine trials that made it through Phase 3 and were funded by the U.S. Government in operational work speed. To help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA sponsored advertisements. To-date, we’ve recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials. The pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring and clinical research, which in turn has accelerated the adoption of our virtual trial technology. In total, we’ve won over 60 new studies using our virtual trials solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with five top 10 pharma clients. The technology suite combines e-consent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication and in platform on health cloud, the sales force platform that is purpose built for healthcare and life sciences. This technology is being deployed to speed vaccine development and was an important factor in helping the team secure the two Phase 3 full service COVID trials that we are working on. The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Biotech funding remains strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all time high. It is these healthy environments combined with our differentiated capabilities, that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team. Our contracted backlog including pass-throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year. We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. We exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.63 including pass-throughs and 1.44 excluding pass-throughs. We expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double-digit in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapies. I’ll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, this was a strong quarter to close the year. Let’s start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,298 million grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $11,359 million, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1,425 million increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency. The sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID-related work that Ari mentioned. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4,858 million, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,684 million was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency. Pass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth, due entirely to COVID work. But you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and 606 basis, again strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate. For the full year R&D Solutions revenue was $5,760 million, essentially flat on both the reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs R&D Solutions full year reported revenue grew 2.2%. CSMS revenue of $189 million was down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency. Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment. As a result, business development activity is slowed. But the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as our clients have largely retained existing field reps. Now moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2,384 million. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61. For the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1,252 million for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42. Now as Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remains strong, backlog group 18.5% year-over-year to close 2020 at $22.6 billion. We expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represents a year-over-year increase of 13.5% and this provides a basis for our 2021 guidance, which I will be discussing shortly. Now let’s go to the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion and debt was $12.5 billion. So our net debt was $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and that compares to a peak of 4.8 times at the end of the second quarter and 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter. And you’ll recall that we’ve committed to deleveraging between 3.5 times and 4 times net leverage as we exit 2022. You can expect that we’ll make good progress towards this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion. The cash flow continues to be a bright spot. Cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. CapEx was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year. We resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $110 billion of our shares. Full year share repurchases were $423 million. We ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program. As a result of our strong free cash flow performance, actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dried powder on our balance sheet between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion. We will continue to be judicious in how we use this liquidity consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage. Okay, let’s turn to guidance now. We are raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range. The new revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million. A little under half of this increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX movements versus a guidance we provided on our third quarter call. I note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year. We are also raising our full year profit guidance, we’ve increased your adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million. The change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus the historic norm. So the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of a stronger organic revenue output. We’re raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 at the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08. This represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%. And let me go a little deeper to provide you with some color to help you with your models. First, when you’re modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be easiest comparison and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison. And within our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, we’ve assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million, other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity. Our guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020. Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rates remain in effect for the balance of the year. Now before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021. We currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% and 12%. R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17%, which includes 100-basis-point headwind from pass-throughs. And CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker earlier in the year and recovering later in the year. Now as in the past, we’re also providing guidance for the coming quarter and this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%. All three segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth at 17.4% to 20.1%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%. So to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and that’s on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019. We posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments. Our R&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year. We posted a strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year, a $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year. We closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash. And as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted EPS growth of over 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio. And with that, let me hand it back over to our Operator for the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Robert Jones: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe just on TAS, it seems like record constant currency growth in the quarter from the segment, despite the advanced management business, I’m assuming, not really coming fully back. And if I heard you correctly, Ari, it sounded like a good portion of the acceleration was driven by real world evidence for the government. I’m just curious how sustainable some of that work might be into 2021 kind of what’s assumed in this healthy guidance of 9% to 12% in TAS? And then just any thoughts on the other pieces of TAS outside of real world evidence and the guidance would be helpful?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you. Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impacts of COVID during 2020 than R&D or CSMS, right? So, all data, analytics, consulting, real world business were pretty much unaffected, and as you know noted, the only pockets there that we had -- where we had issues were the events management business, which essentially came to a halt. Now, in the fourth quarter the underlying TAS business return to normal growth rate. It had already returned to normal growth rates in the third quarter, I think, we posted 9.2% a constant currency growth in the third quarter. The sequential increase in that growth rate in the fourth quarter, which is about, let’s call it, 600 basis points was entirely due, as you know noted, to the incremental work from COVID-related activities. So we expect this incremental contribution to continue about the same pace into the first quarter. Now, similar to R&DS, the COVID work in TAS has been faster execution and the guidance that we give you for 2021 does include the COVID work that we have visibility to, but I can tell you, there is no COVID work in the second half of 2021 that’s built into our guidance. It’s still early in the year, so this could change, right? It’s not going to stop abruptly. But right now, the bulk of what we see in terms of COVID work in TAS for 2021 is in the first quarter, similar as in the fourth quarter and a little bit of sales in the second quarter and that’s it. What is that COVID work, by the way? It’s mainly related to projects for governments, essentially using our people and analytics to support authorities in the management of the crisis. The real work -- real world work for the FDA that I described in my introductory remarks. We also performing large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patience for other governments, Europe and Asia, around the world. And we’re assuming that’s going to go away certainly by the middle of the year in our guidance. But again, that’s -- that could be -- that could prove to be and I have an expectation -- again, it’s not built in the guidance, but an expectation that we will continue to have similar type of work as we’ve developed capabilities and really a new set of offerings which we intend to go-to-market going forward.
Robert Jones: No. That’s helpful, Ari. And if I could just ask one on the R&DS side, similar question. I know that the COVID work in the past or implications has been kind of a moving target, but just similar thoughts would be appreciated on how you’re thinking about COVID versus non-COVID-related work in the R&DS guidance for 2021.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So, again, just as in TAS, COVID work did contribute significantly to R&DS growth. Obviously, I mean, look, mid double-digit growth in TAS is not the new normal. We’ve said TAS growth accelerated, but it accelerated to the high single-digit growth that we always anticipated pre-pandemic. If you go back to the guidance we gave, the long-term guidance we gave in June of 2019. We did expect TAS to reach high single-digit 8%, 9% and eventually 10%. But that’s the underlying TAS growth business. Now, with R&DS, it also, of course, would be misleading to look at the R&DS business, and say, that’s the normal mid double-digit growth. Obviously, it’s hard to -- it’s harder to determine what would have been without the COVID work, because without the COVID work, there would have been other business that had essentially been pushed to the right, right, in our MDS, as you can understand. But by the way, even absence the large COVID trials that we’ve been a privilege to work on, we would have had very strong underlying R&DS services growth in the fourth quarter as well. Now, we expect COVID work to be with us through 2021 and maybe also into 2022, because there’s a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers to meet global demand. There are new vaccines that are being developed for variants of the virus. There are alternative vaccines that are needed in case of adverse safety events or quality issues or manufacturing delays. There are novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions. And of course, there are post-approval commitments to regulators, all of which do require continued R&D work. Now, look, we have a large backlog to execute, 22.6 billion at the end of 2020. We are, look, we have got the ability to execute on this existing backlog and that ability will continue to improve. Site startup and patient recruitment continues to improve. The next 12 month revenue from backlog has increase. So, all of this provides the basis for our 2021 R&DS revenue guide guidance. The pipeline of opportunities is very strong. If we exclude COVID opportunities, our pipeline is showing good growth. For example, the oncology pipeline is in the mid double-digit growth. The CNS pipeline is up low-double digits to at least 12%, 13%. Cardiovascular and diabetes pipe is growing strong double digits, very, very strong double digits. So we know if your question is suggesting that what happens post-COVID? We’re not falling off a cliff. We have -- the vast majority of the backlog is not COVID, obviously. If you look at our bookings in 2020, every quarter except for the first quarter, obviously, COVID-related work represented between 15% and 20% of our services bookings. And for the year, I think, it was exactly 15%, 1-5. So we continue to book very, very solid good business across all therapy areas and we expect our strong growth in R&DS to continue even post-COVID. Thank you.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks, Ari.
Andrew Markwick: If we can move to next question in the queue please, Operator?
Operator: Yeah. Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. Ari, start a follow up on the first question, but I think previously you talked about real world evidence actually picking up as the pandemic lingers, just given that, you need to understand why people have more severe symptoms, a lot of vaccines were rushed to market. So I’m just curious as to why you think that piece will drop off after the first quarter given there seems to be a growing need and most of your peers are talking about it being a pretty strong year for real world evidence?
Andrew Markwick: Yeah.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Go ahead, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Markwick: Yeah. I guess, I mean, Tycho, I think, Ari was alluding to earlier. I think he said, look, it’s still early in the year and this could change it. And then we want to get ahead of ourselves and bake anything into our guidance, but we don’t have line of sight into our contracts. It’s obviously a fast moving environment with the COVID work and its fast execution and we saw very good growth in the first quarter and we expect that to repeat in the second quarter of TAS. Ari mentioned in his prepared remarks at the beginning, obviously, we’re doing work with the FDA and we’re looking at how COVID is impacting the population and what kind of treatments and therapies have people been on or drug regimen have people been on, I mean, their symptoms maybe aren’t as severe as other patients. And so we’ve obviously got a seat at the table here. We’re talking to government and I think that means we’re becoming kind of the company of choice with other governments around the world. But I think we just don’t want to get ahead of ourselves here and think of anything else. Ron, if you have?
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. I would just add, Tycho, that we’ve included in our guidance, what we have direct visibility to, but this is a very fast moving environment and things pop up all the time. So it could change.
Ari Bousbib: I mean, look, yeah. It’s just like. We’re delighted to have this COVID work, right? I mean, we are super excited, because the broader picture here strategically is that these crises, as bad as it was, for everyone. In terms of our company, we’ve been talking -- it’s almost like this company existed for situations like this. All of a sudden, the sets of capabilities that we’ve spent so much effort and investment developing, proved to be exactly what was needed to help our clients and to help governments, whether it’s on the commercial side, on the real world side or on the R&DS side. And our relationship with clients has been strengthened. This -- our sets of capabilities have been demonstrated and we expect to continue to capture an ever bigger share of spend going forward into the very long-term in the life sciences industry. And we really are very excited by the pipeline of opportunities, again both on the commercial side and on the R&DS side.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just two quick follow ups, I’m just curious on recovery trends, where you stand in terms of site accessibility. I think it was 70% coming out of 3Q. So where does that stand today? And then, separately, I didn’t hear you mentioned OCT. I’m just curious how we should think about that rollout and any potential synergies with OCE? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: What was your first -- your first -- what was the question.
Andrew Markwick: First question was on site.
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. First question was on site access and site access actually remained fairly close to the 70% number.
Ari Bousbib: Right.
Ron Bruehlman: We’ve just learned ways to work around it. Although, we would expect it to improve gradually.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. I mean, look, in the first -- when the trough in the -- at the worst moment of the crisis, we were like less than 20% of site access and that really created huge headwinds for our R&DS business, as you know. Second quarter earnings call, we told you that we would -- we had gone up to 53% site access. And at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 70% site access. And the kind of bad news good news here that we have not improved that metric, it remained at 70%. However, we’ve learned to work around that and the reason why it hasn’t gone back to 100%, frankly, is because of all these new flare ups, et cetera. But the good news here is that it’s been all right, because the -- it’s not so much we found with the number of sites, but it’s really other metrics. The main metric we looked at the beginning of the pandemic was site access, because again, without that you’ve got nothing. But we found out that there is a critical mass of site access, which again, we think is about the level where we are now, whereby our remote monitoring capabilities then prevent material disruption to the delivery of our services in general. We’ve got site networks, relationships, we can work around sites that are not yet up and running for clinical research and today we can pivot much faster to remote monitoring versus when this pandemic hit. Now, if you look at startup activity, which is another important metric that we were looking at, which had also come to a halt, is now back to baseline levels pre-pandemic and that’s extremely good news. And there hasn’t been any major change from this due to the increases in COVID cases or the new variants of the virus. So startup activity, people have learned to work with the virus and it’s essentially back to pre-pandemic levels and we don’t see that changing. Patient recruitment, another very important metric. Obviously, here we lag site startup, but essentially those trends are very strong and the patients are returning to sites essentially close to pre-pandemic levels. So, again, we’re very encouraged by that. You have another question on…
Tycho Peterson: Orchestrated clinical trials, the OCT rollout and…
Ari Bousbib: OCT.
Tycho Peterson: … how do you think about that? Yeah.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mentioned that, in my prepared remarks that our virtual trials, technology has been really brought to the front here in the context of COVID. If you step back and think about what OCT is, there’s really four blocks. There is the digital site suite, which you don’t focus on the pin -- on the site portal, payments, ETMF. Then there is a digital patient suite with -- what the patient has to go through with e-consent, eCOA, that’s where the virtual trial essentially is the study hub. Then you have the digital trial management suite with the CTMS, risk-based monitoring and then you have the compliance suite with RIM Smart and Vigilant. So the technologies in our site suite, the patient suite and the compliance suite went live during 2020. And the technologies in our trial management suite will be going live shortly, most likely end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of this year. So, again, all these four suites, the site, the patient and the compliance, they are all went live during 2020 and the trial management suite will be live to be probably March, April timeframe this year. And we are seeing very strong interest on clients. We have seen an increase in RFP activity for OCT platform, not just for individual suites or standalone products, but for the whole platform. We are seeing interest on all customer segments large, mid and AVP [ph] and stay tuned. We’ll report more on that. But the answer to your question is, we are live for most of the products and it will be fully live and operational by the beginning of the second quarter.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So backlog conversion clearly improved even when we back the COVID benefit -- COVID project benefit. So when we think about 2021, when should we expect the backlog conversion to be back to that 7.6% over the pre-COVID level? Should we think about it as sort of second half of 2021 or more kind of like spilled to 2022? And then the second question, when are you talking about patient recruitment and the fact that you’re starting to see patients are coming back to the sites at pre-COVID levels? Are you seeing any impact on how on trial designs, I mean, clearly right now still a relatively low percentage of the population is vaccinated. But as we see more people vaccinated would that impact how you think about trial design and potentially the pace of recruiting new patients to trial.
Ron Bruehlman: So, Ricky, the line was pretty bad there. We were struggling to hear you a little bit. I think your second part of the question was around patient recruitment and are we seeing -- expecting I guess pick up in terms of the population getting back and [Technical Difficulty] and people returning besides. I think, from what we are seeing…
Ricky Goldwasser: So, actually the question is, if we think about it, are -- is individuals are vaccinated. If that sort of change how you guys think about designing trials? If someone has a COVID vaccine, does this mean that they might be compromised and can’t participate in trials?
Ron Bruehlman: No.
Ari Bousbib: I don’t think so. No. No.
Ron Bruehlman: No. I think it’s all part of the general recovery that we’re seeing and…
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. No.
Ron Bruehlman: But the way we are seeing.
Ari Bousbib: It doesn’t change anything to the design of the trials. I mean, it just another element that allows a patient to access offices sites or interact with healthcare professionals. But would be -- would have been the same with a negative test or a -- or somebody with antibodies. I mean, that doesn’t change anything to the design, no. And then the second -- the first...
Ron Bruehlman: What was first part of the question, Ricky, I was -- we were really struggling to hear on our side?
Ricky Goldwasser: So the first one was, if you think about backlog conversion, clearly backlog conversion…
Ron Bruehlman: Oh! Oh! Yeah.
Ricky Goldwasser: … in the quarter even when we excluding COVID. So when do you expect to return to the pre-COVID levels that 7.6%, is -- should we think about it when we model the second half of 2021 or in early 2022 time -- timeline?
Ron Bruehlman: Look, like, the backlog conversion is a really tough statistic to model out, because it depends on backlog burn, because it depends on how much we’re adding to the backlog in any quarter. So what we’ve tried to do is provide guidance to tell you how much we think it’s going to burn during the course of the year, the next 12 months revenue and allow you to take it from there. Yes, the COVID work does burn quicker than the other work. There’s no question about that. But we don’t guide to a particular backlog conversion rate, because it’s just too difficult to do, because it depends also on how much you happen to be booking, if you’re booking a lot, like, we have been recently than obviously the backlog goes up and the burn rate goes down. But that’s not a bad thing. So, yes, I would expect you would see a faster burn of the COVID-related work, which we mentioned was about 15% of our service bookings in 2020 and a more normal rate of burn on the rest of the backlog. And I think it still remains to be seen how much additional COVID-related work we’re going to book as we go through 2021. That’s still a question mark.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks. Thanks, Ricky. I think if we can move to the next question in the queue, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. I have one technical question and then more strategic one. So, first off, I’m getting a couple of inbound asks on the FX update. I’m just curious if you could maybe clarify, be more clear for us people who missed it. The FX guidance for 2021, is it plus 200 bps tailwind for the full year in total or was the update today that that’s an incremental 200 bps since you first gave 2021 guidance a few months ago?
Ron Bruehlman: So when you look at the year-over-year FX impact, when you’re looking at the growth rate, ultimately, if you’re trying to take our reported guidance and get to a constant currency guidance, it’s…
Eric Coldwell: Yeah.
Ron Bruehlman: … 100-basis-point tailwind year-over-year. Similar to that in TAS and CSMS and a little bit lower in R&D, maybe about 100 basis points in R&D.
Ari Bousbib: No. He is asking versus the previous guidance…
Ron Bruehlman: Versus the previous…
Eric Coldwell: Yeah. That would be the follow on is, what was embedded in the guidance a few months back, so we could just see the delta?
Ron Bruehlman: Previous guidance was 150.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah.
Andrew Markwick: Yeah. So...
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. So, previous guidance on 100 basis points and this will goes to the 200 basis points tailwind.
Eric Coldwell: Perfect. Thank you very much for that. A little more interesting question, really positive trends here in the cash flow and I know it’s been -- Ron, I know, it’s been a big focus for you. We’ve seen some nice improvement here over the last few quarters. I’m just -- I am hoping you can maybe break this into two pieces. First off, could you give us anything a little more specific or precise on what’s really driving the improvement operationally number one? And number two, perhaps parse out from that if maybe some of the timing on the COVID vaccine work and the higher pass-through tailwind that you did finally get here in the fourth quarter, was that -- how much of a contribution was that versus, let’s say, core underlying fundamental improvement?
Ron Bruehlman: Look, it’s good question. The -- as you can see from our cash flow statement, the principal driver, in fact, pretty much the whole driver of our improvement in cash flow -- free cash flow in 2020 was due to improve collections performance. And that’s a combination of collecting quicker, but also billing in a more timely fashion and structuring contracts, so that we built earlier. And part of our collections effort, which we put a lot of focus on was bringing down our overdue receivables. We took our eye off the ball on that a little bit and put a lot of focus on that and we’re able to substantially put a dent in our overdue receivables, which has helped quite a bit. And I think a lot of the processes we put in place, all of them should persist in the 2021. We have to continue to put emphasis on it. But we’ve improved our processes and we expect that to continue. Now you did identify something that’s important, which is that the COVID-related work did bring some benefit in terms of customer advances and being able to bill in advance that helped our 2020 cash flow. I would -- so when you look at our 2020 cash flow, as a percentage of adjusted net income, it was unusually high. We target more in the 80% to 90% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income in a normal year. But cash flow is very lumpy, so it bounces around. We had a very strong year in 2021 amidst as a percentage of net income, excuse me, 2020 as a percentage of net income that probably won’t be quite as strong in 2020. But fundamentally, we’ve improved quite a lot in terms of cash conversion and you should see continued benefit from that going into the future.
Eric Coldwell: That’s very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks. I think we are coming out close to the hour. But if we can take one more question, please.
Operator: Absolutely. Your last question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a two-part question. One was on OCE. So, obviously, continued progress there. I’m just wondering when do we begin to see OCE show up in revenue and then you talked about the timetable that was discussed deployed and then you begin to generate traction on that with 140 wins to-date, any color about what’s baked in the 2021 guidance and if not kind of when do we see it?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. So, again, we continue to see very good traction in the marketplace. Obviously it takes time to deploy. We had 60 client wins in 2020 and I should point out, obviously, despite the difficult environment created by the pandemic, we continue to sell. Total 140 clients win since launch. We keep winning two out of three times against competition. We are deploying large clients which we disclose before. We have a global deployment with Roche. We have global deployment with Novo Nordisk International Operations, AstraZeneca U.S. deployment as well. We have another top 15 pharma deployment for a country in Asia and other top 15 pharma companies that’s globally deploying for the medical teams. So we already have, I mean, is -- I’m not sure if we should disclose this number, but we do have tens of thousands of users already. Now that did move the needle on $12.9 billion revenue company, no, not in 2021, but it is providing very significant growth. And certainly, it is an area where we expect strong margin drop through over time as we complete implementations. As you know, it’s a -- the drop through becomes much more attractive when revenue is license driven and we’re starting to see that, but it will continue to increase as we complete deployments and implementation. Now, we continue to sell. So that also will require implementation. And the strategy overall is the same as for any technology company, which is the land and expand model, and as you know, we resolve the HCP engagement management, I mentioned it. We saw the HCP compliance. We are launching additional modules and continue to expand. So it’s not just OCE, OCE was kind of the centerpiece and then it continues to grow. Ron, anything?
Ron Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to say, I think, sometimes investors have a tendency to equate our tech business with OCE, because we’ve all talked about it a lot and we have a competitor in that space that talks about it a lot as well. But we have a much broader tech business, as Ari was saying, then just that. I mean, across performance management, compliance, information management, social media, we -- your payer provider and then we have a growing clinical tech segment. So, just want to emphasize that the tech is a lot more than just OCE that for IQVIA.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks very much, Dan. So we’re at the top of the hour now. So thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 earnings call and we’ll be available for the rest of the day to take any follow up questions that you might have. Thank you everyone.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call, on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations Web site at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter marked a nice sequential improvement in our financial performance, with results coming in above the high-end of our expectations. You will recall that based on early signs of recovery at the end of the second quarter, we raised our guidance for the year. Based on stronger than expected performance in the third quarter, we are again raising our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. We're expecting a continuation of these recovery trends in the fourth quarter. This of course sets us up well for next year. As we promised back in April at the onset of this pandemic, we will talk to you today about our outlook for 2021. Based on what we currently see, we think the most significant COVID impact to our business are behind us, and our outlook for 2021 indicates strong performance next year, and a return to our growth trajectory. Ron will discuss 2020 and 2021 guidance in more detail later. Before we review the quarter, a quick operational update, we continue to experience a gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical resource sites in the R&D Solutions business even with the localized flare-ups we've seen around the world. We are seeing a return to on-site monitoring visits, and similar to last quarter, on-site visits exceeded the number of remote visits. In instances where sites remain physically inaccessible for clinical monitoring, remote monitoring and virtual solutions are proving to be effective workarounds. The pace of startup activity picked up significantly during the first quarter, and we are pretty much back to baseline levels for site initiation visits. Of course, special recruitment trends have started to follow as well. Moving to Technology & Analytics, as expected TAS has remained resilient throughout this crisis in almost every area. We've had very little interruption in data supply or demand. Our information services continue to be mission critical to our clients, and are therefore very insulated from the impacts of the pandemic. The analytics and consulting businesses are performing remarkably well, development being hampered by the lack of in-person interactions. One area we discussed before that has experienced significant disruption is the event management business, which relies almost entirely on face-to-face interaction, and of course, as you know, that business is essentially on pause for now. Demand for our technology offerings remains strong. We've added 45 OCE clients this year, bringing our total number of clients to 125. During the quarter, we successfully rolled out OCE Optimizer, a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution. These tools saved management teams significant amounts of time previously spent planning and assessing sales data to ensure resources are effectively focused on the appropriate client base and products. Finally, our CSMS business, demand for field reps continues to be soft, which of course impacts revenue, but as we said before, while business development has also slowed due to the lack of in-person interactions, so far the business has performed modestly better than we would have expected as existing clients have largely retained field reps and have been continuing their engagements with us. Now against that backdrop, let's now review our third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $2,786 million, which was $11 million above the high end of our guidance range. This revenue beat came from strong organic operational performance. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $604 million, with a $22 million beat versus the high end of our guidance range. The EBITDA beat was due to better operational performance and productivity. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.63, reflecting the EBITDA drop through because the below-the-line item essentially netted out to zero. Third quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $21.7 billion as of September 30, 2020. We have broad-based bookings strength, but full-service clinical and lab were particularly strong. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass throughs was 1.71 for the third quarter of 2020, and 1.42 excluding pass throughs. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio, at September 30, was 1.55 including pass throughs, and 1.45 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.
Ron Bruehlman: Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Let's turn first to revenue. Third quarter revenue of $2,786 million grew 0.6% reported, and was flat at constant currency. Revenue for the first nine months of the year was $8,061 million, which was down 1.6% reported, and 1.2% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,207 million grew 10.2% reported, and 9.2% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $3,433 million, up 4.9% reported, and 5.6% at constant currency. In R&D Solutions, third quarter revenue of $1,400 million was down 4.5% at actual FX rate, and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass throughs, R&D Solution third quarter revenue grew 2.6%. Year-to-date revenue of $4,076 million was down 5.6% at actual FX rate, and 5.4% at constant currency. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue of $179 million was down 13.9% year-over-year reported, and 14.4 % on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $552 million, down 8.6% at actual FX rate, and 8.3% at constant currency. Now moving down to P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $604 million for the third quarter, which represented growth of 1.9%, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1,649 million. Third quarter GAAP net income was $101 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $160 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.82. Adjusted income was $318 million for the quarter and $841 million year-to-date. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.9% in the third quarter at $1.63. Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.32. Now turning to the R&D Solutions backlog, as Ari mentioned, R&DS new business activity remains quite strong. Consequent on the robust booking activity that Ari talked about, our backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year with close at $21.7, and we expect $5.8 billion of this backlog to convert to renew over the next 12 months, which is an increase of over $400 million versus where we were at June 30, and I would add that the outlook remains quite positive as RFPs are growing low double digits in both volume and dollars. Moving to the balance sheet now, at September 30, cash and cash equivalents total $1.5 billion and debt was $12.3 billion resulting in net debt of $10.9 billion. Due to our strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter, our net leverage ratio at September 30 was 4.7 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, which was down a tick from where we were at June 30. Cash flow was a bright spot as it last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $574 million in the third quarter, up 74% over last year. Capital expenditures were $157 million and that resulted in free cash flow of $470 million. M&A spending as you saw was negligible in the quarter. For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $769 million which is about double the same period last year. Now as you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares in the second or third quarters, but the business is recovering well from COVID-19 disruptions. Underlying demand is robust and cash flow is as well, and we have a very solid liquidity position. Closing the quarter with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and as a result of all this, we have lifted our suspension on share repurchase program, and we are expecting to opportunistically resume share repurchase activity, and as a reminder, we currently have about $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. Given the continuing momentum in the business, we are raising our full-year guidance range for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020 assumes that business congestions will continue to improve during the fourth quarter, and specifically, we assume that localized flare-ups of COVID-19 will not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. We now expect 2020 revenue for the full-year to be between $11,100 million and $11,250 million, which is an increase of $125 million over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. For profit, we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $2,335 million and $2,360 million which represent a $27 million increase over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range, and adjusted diluted EPS we are expecting to be between $6.25 and $6.35, which is an increase of $0.10 over our prior guidance, again at the midpoint of the range. This full-year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue of $3,040 million to $3,190 million, representing growth of 5.0 to 10.2%. Now, this is a wider range than we would normally guide to at this point in year due to the uncertain timing of pass-through revenues associated with the COVID trials that we are working on. From a segment perspective, we expect Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue would be in the high single digits at the midpoint of our guidance range, R&D Solutions revenue growth to reach double-digits, with the caveat that this growth rate could move up or down based on the timing of pass through revenue, and CSMS revenue growth to be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. For fourth quarter profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $685 million and $710 million, representing growth of 6.7% to 10.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.92 and $2.03 or growth of 10.9% to 16.7%. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates at September 30, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the year. As we indicated at the start of the pandemic, we've decided to advance our planning process versus prior years, and as a result we're now in a position to provide our 2021 outlook, and this is much earlier than we would have done in the ordinary course. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $12,300 million to $12,600 million. This represents growth at 10.1% to 12.8% versus the midpoint of our 2020 guide. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be the range of $2,725 million to $2,800 million, representing growth at 16.1% to 19.3% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, and finally, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, which would represent growth of 21.4% to 26.2% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance. A little bit more detail for you, the adjusted diluted EPS guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $420 million, operational depreciation and amortization of about $400 million, and other below-the-line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million, and also a continuation of our share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate we're assuming will remain largely in line with 2020. Our 2021 guidance is predicated on the assumption that business conditions will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, and that majority of business will return to normal during 2021. Our outlook for 2021 also incorporates our view that there will be some tail of COVID work, but growth in R&DS will come primarily from our base business. So in summary, we're pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenges that COVID has presented throughout the year, and we're proud to be a critical contributor to the solution to this public health crisis. Our R&DS business has adapted well, returning to growth in services revenue, and achieving another record quarter of bookings. Our Technology & Analytics Solutions business improved sequentially and has returned to pre COVID growth rates despite the headwinds of the event management business. Our solid year-to-date overall company performance has enabled us to raise our guidance for the full-year for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS, and now this performance combined with our strong free cash flow and liquidity position has enabled us to lift the suspension of our share repurchase program, and finally, we are expecting continued recovery in the fourth quarter and a very strong 2021. So, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much, and good morning. I was curious if you could share with us the percent of your bookings this quarter that came from COVID-related trials? You did give us the metric last quarter, as did I think virtually all of your peers.
Ari Bousbib: I think looking at the contracted services bookings, in the quarter it was about 20%.
Eric Coldwell: And, Ari, I assume higher on a pass through basis given the nature of those large vaccine studies?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean the -- it's very hard, the timing of pass throughs and the volume of pass throughs is different. Look, we have a lot of COVID awards since the start of the pandemic, many of them small from protocol reviews. I mean I think we had like close to 200 different awards around the world, so gives you a sense. Some of them very tiny, some protocol reviews, we have lab work. They range from -- you had normal fees to, of course, we are on several of the large vaccine trials, not necessarily doing the entire work but we, for example, have been awarded work I think on four of the five trials that are part of Operation Warp Speed that are in phase three. So sometimes we've got in -- and in a couple of cases we've got the full service work, and, of course, there we've got big pass through numbers. In other cases we'll get the lab work, the pharmacovigilance work. So we are very involved, and some of that work does not include pass through, some of that it does include pass throughs. A lot of trials where we have full clinical work do have big pass through numbers which have not been yet into -- in our revenue numbers given that, as you probably know, we are in our full service vaccine work is in at a later stage than to have some of our competitors who have already seen that revenue -- that very strong revenue flow through in prior quarter or will seek in this quarter, in Q3, mostly from pass through revenue.
Eric Coldwell: That's very helpful, and if I could get you to just follow on to that, a number of investors are focused on how the COVID work plays out over the next several quarters. When do you expect a peak in bookings and/or revenue from COVID-related trials at which point we would obviously need the quarter to be back fully to offset any year-over-year comparisons that might be developing?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, well look, I mean in developing -- I'm sorry, you're talking about 2021 obviously.
Eric Coldwell: Yes, and [multiple speakers] -- yes.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, so I mean, look, Eric, we have spent a lot of time, as mentioned back in April, we wanted to try to give you a sense for how 2021 would shape up, and we've spent a lot of time, bottom up, reviewing what would happen. As you know, we affect everything or piece of work across our business segments with probabilities and an assessment of what revenue would be derived in subsequent periods. So the same applies to the COVID trials. Most of the revenue on the large full-service COVID trial is pass through, okay, so there's no impact to profit, and that's just the fact. When you are a full service work on a vaccine trial you have to remember there are cases I've seen, I don't know if that's the case with us, but it's where the past revenue is a ratio of 10 to one, in other words $10 or pass through versus $1 of service revenue, whereas in normal traditional trials we would see one pass through dollar to each two or three dollars of service revenue, and once again, pass throughs is totally irrelevant to our profits, it has no impact whatsoever. So, it makes it very difficult to predict. So that's one element of the COVID trial. The second one is, of course, we've taken into account the possibility that vaccine trials get cancelled. There could be a vaccine that gets approved, or two, or three, and the others ones feel that it's not economically worthwhile for the sponsor to continue to vaccine trial. In fact historically, well before COVID, we know from experience that vaccine work carries an unusually high risk of cancellation versus traditional other drug developments. So with all of that in mind, so we know all of that, we've factored all of that into our guidance, and we feel good and we have anticipated in many in our possibility and many such scenarios, and we feel good about that. Now, you bear in mind that a lot of the work that was supposed to come online, new projects, have been put on hold by our clients because many clients have devoted their attention, resources to COVID, whether it's for therapeutics or for vaccine work, and we do expect, in fact our clients have told us that when that phase goes away they'll go back to the projects they were supposed to have been working on in 2020. So we have no concern that all of a sudden, if that's what you're alluding to, there will be a kind of a drop in either bookings or revenue, we do not expect that, and we've factored a lot of that potential variability into our guidance. That's the benefit of having such a wide diversified portfolio as we do have at IQVIA, both within our R&DS business and our TAS business. You should also realize that we are getting a lot of interest from public health authorities and also a lot from sponsors for pharmacovigilance, in other words tracking COVID patients. Our real world business is experiencing strong double-digit growth, and we expect continued interest in pandemic-related work in general. We all hope this will be the last time that it ever, but we also all know and understand that crises will happen in the future, and perhaps the magnitude of the COVID crisis has taught all of us a lot of interesting things that we are going to put in place going forward in terms of preparedness, in terms of patient tracking, in terms of monitoring what exactly -- you've seen our press release on the CARE Project with the FDA, where we are looking at patients who have potentially been exposed to COVID. We are connecting all the dots between their medical history and our de-identified patient records, understanding what types of vitamins they've been taking, what other drug regimens they've been under, and trying to determine a map of at-risk populations with a lot more precision than what's been done today. So all of those projects are in the pipe, and I expect those to continue irrespective of whether the COVID crisis ends or not. So again, everything has been factored into our guidance.
Eric Coldwell: Ari, thank you very much for the detailed answers, I appreciate it.
Operator: Next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. Ari, just to kind of continue on that, I think you mentioned to Eric that about 20% of your bookings were COVID-related. For the other 80%, are you able to start those studies up and enroll in a fairly reasonable basis or would you say that's still broadly impaired?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Well, okay, as I said in my introductory remarks, with respect to site initiation visits which -- and site startup activity, that's the area of our business that has seen the strongest improvement. In fact, the site initiation visits are back to baseline levels, and recruitment of positions obviously starting to follow. So I think actually very good moves on that front. The accessibility to sites for trials that are in flight hasn't quite recovered. We are currently at about, I want to say the -- I look at my team about 70%, right. We are currently for global, if you look globally at our sites we are back to about 70% normal accessibility. That's a bit below what we would have expected, but interestingly it's critical site, because a site is not a site is not a site. There are sites that are very tiny, and the relative incremental value of opening that sites doesn't mean as much. So we are focused on the ones that are most significant. So that's for in-flight trials, and we're returning gradually to normal activity there. For new trails, again site startup activities has resumed, site initiation as essentially the visits are where they should be normally pre-COVID levels, normally patient recruitment lives, but that has increased significantly throughout the quarter, patient recruitment was fundamentally disrupted, okay, because essentially everything was put on a hold, and we're gradually going back, we have good momentum, and we don't think we will recover to baseline level and sometime in 2021, but again all of that is factored into our guidance.
John Kreger: Great, thank you. One quick follow-up, can you give us a sense about where your focus is on sort of new technology development? I think in the past, you've talked about an OCT suite launch by year-end, is that still on the table?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, absolutely. As you know, we've had great success with OCT coming from behind, and we therefore along with our partners Salesforce, we expanded the relationship to clinical tech platform in tools on the health cloud, we have seven technologies available today for digital sides and patient suites. The digital patient suite includes products such as eConsent, eCOA, and also patient portal. We will by the end of the year have the digital trial management suite go live probably before the end of the year, and the products will include CTMS, risk based monitoring, and the mobile CRA platform. So again, the fully orchestrated solution, OCT, that you're referring to, will be available by the end of this year. Again, we are also coming from behind in this area, but we will be claiming our fair share as we're doing in OCT on the commercial side. Thank you.
John Kreger: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Ari, maybe just a follow-up there, you're saying that site activations are getting back to normal and patient recruitment obviously catching up. You saw X pass through growth in RDS I think of around 2.6%, I guess, what needs to happen to see the double-digit RDS growth in 4Q, and more importantly, what has to happen between now and over the course of '21 to kind of get to that guidance range, is there a lot that needs to improve, or is it just kind of a normal course of what you're already seeing that needs to play out in order to get to these 4Q and 2021 RDS targets?
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, we've said that we should be seeing or reaching double-digit RDS growth in Q4, okay, and we do expect mid-teens in 2021. So, what needs to happen is all normal course of business based on the work that we've done that I described earlier in my reply to Eric's question, our guidance is being bottom-up, as we always do project-by-project and we make an assumption of -- look, I mean what needs to happen is things are going to happen, okay? The elections are going to be behind us, there will be more clarity in environment, there will be at least two or three vaccines out there, people have learned to live with this, people are moving on, and all of that will happen sometime in 2021 during the year. Obviously, this assumes when we say "Normal Business Conditions," it means that what we're seeing today, the trends that we're seeing today, the improvements that we are seeing today continue with a bit more stability in 2021 due to all of these factors being unclear, again, election behind, more clarity on the environment, vaccines learning to live with this thing, all of these assumes when we say stable business conditions it means there is no new pandemic, God forbid, or anything like that, and it's a new normal, if you will, and that's what we're assuming; nothing extraordinary, nothing needs to happen, I should point out that we haven't done any acquisitions of significance as you know really for the past two years. I mean we haven't been spent at the rate that we used to. This is all organic for the most part, and so again, we feel very good about this guidance.
Bob Jones: That's fair, and I guess maybe just one follow-up, we haven't spent a lot of time on TAS. You described it as resilient, but I think the growth rates the highest we've seen in years. Can you maybe just spend a little bit more time there talking about what's driving the performance in TAS? I know you mentioned real world evidence, but just wanted to get a little bit more clarity behind the record growth you're seeing in that segment?
Ari Bousbib: Look, the performance is the reflection of the sales, I can't say a different way of the resilience of the business, A lot of what we do is mission critical to our clients with or without the pandemic. Certainly the data business hasn't moved. If anything, there was -- if it proves how mission critical it was. We probably had the best visibility, I mean, you guys and a lot of people out there felt we were insane back at the beginning of the pandemic for giving relatively precise guidance for the balance of the year, and now here we are, and it looks like more or less we are on target and that it's not because we're geniuses, it's because we have visibility, we've got businesses that they allow us to have that visibility, and we are global. So, there are different stages of the pandemic in different parts of the world, so we can model this out, we have our internal database, deep analytics, predictive analytics, and modeling capability.
.: Ron, do you want to add…
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, just one thing I would emphasize, Bob, if there was a surprise versus where we were expecting early in the year, it's our analytics and consulting business has continued to be very strong, and I think Ari highlighted that in his prepared remarks that we were expecting some disruption due to business development activity, face-to-face selling being affected, and in fact that hasn't, our analytics and consulting visits has been quite strong.
Bob Jones: Thanks for all that. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Ari, starting with R&D, does the 4Q guidance assume resumption of any of the trials that have been halted with J&J and AstraZeneca, and then, what gives you the confidence that COVID flare-up won't impact results? I know you talked about site initiation visits back to baseline levels, but I guess what I'm really asking you is have you taken steps to try to kind of mitigate any impact of flare-ups, and then, as we look ahead to 2021 in R&D, can you just give us a sense of how much could contribute to that mid-teens growth you talked about? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean you asked me about the impacts of the delays in the vaccine work. Yes, I mean, first of all, interruptions in trials in general are a common occurrence. There are adverse events. In the case of vaccine trials where you have the number, which is arguably one of the reasons why fasteners are so big, because the number of patients enrolling in vaccine trials is huge, we're talking about massive amounts 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 people in a trial. You're going to have adverse events, and those adverse events will cause an interruption of the trial, but again, we've factored that in. It's all in our guidance, and we don't expect -- and by the way, as I mentioned before, there are also cancellations in vaccine trials that are more likely. So, look, again we factored that in, we put probabilities on all of our vaccine work, and bear in mind, cancellation is only result in 100% of lost revenue, there is one down and so on, and finally, frankly, since for the full service trial, the one that we talked about, most of the revenue is pass through. So, and this is COVID work. So, it's not likely or maybe even on the service, the small portion of the revenue that's service, it's not like we're making a margin or a margin at all, right, because it's part of our contribution to the effort. So, that's for the vaccine, and what was the other question you had?
Tycho Peterson: Yes, I mean, it was whether you're taking proactive steps to mitigate any impact from COVID flare-ups? You talked about set initiation levels, but what gives you confidence and no impact, and then on the 2021 outlook you talked about COVID being 20% of awards, but how much do you think it contributes to growth that mentions growth next year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I don't have to give you the exact contribution to vote, but it's not what's creating the very strong double-digit growth that we expect.
Ron Bruehlman: We have solid growth next year in revenue in R&DS even excluding like COVID work. That's the short answer.
Tycho Peterson: Right.
Ari Bousbib: By the way, our growth this year, underlying growth without the COVID work also, not that great growth, but…
Ron Bruehlman: In Q4 also…
Ari Bousbib: Yes, in Q4 also, yes, yes, but the flare-ups, I mean look, if it continues in the same proportion and occurrence, and frequency as we see now, that's what's factoring in our guidance, but again, eventually, with the advent of vaccines by the end of the year, or next year, we think all of that will -- and people we learn how to work with this, it's already happening. If you look at, again China is a good -- things are back to normal in China, I'd say entirely, I mean, it's not 100%, it's 95% plus accessible. There are flare-ups by the way in China, but people just work with this. Also again, we have to do some catch-up work, bear in mind, that's also factored into our guidance. We did a lot of remote monitoring this year when we couldn't access the site, and I think people forget that we are not going to move to 100% remote monitoring, okay? There is still a requirement by all regulatory authorities around the world that source document verification has to occur on site. FDA, all the regulatory explicitly require that the source document should not be shared remotely. So again, obviously, what has changed is the number of data points that might be looked at remotely like key safety and efficacy data for example, and so, there's reduced requirements on less critical data, but in general, we still have to do that work that we will not be able to do. So, all of that is, "Pent-up Demand" that needs to be addressed in the coming quarters, catch-up work, if you will.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, and then, Ari, last quick one on CSMS, can that return to, you know call it low single-digit growth next year?
Ari Bousbib: I don't know about that, because I'm not going to venture to make prediction on CSMS, I've been wrong in both directions. I have assumed they would go down and they went up, and I assumed they would go up, and they went down. So, look, what's factored into our guidance is kind of flattish five growth, okay, if it's plus 1%, plus 2%, I don't know; flattish growth, flattish for next year.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.
Ari Bousbib: More detail on the segments when we provide guidance in the ordinary course at the beginning of '21 when we share full-year results and Q4 results, and as we traditionally do, and we'll give more detail on segments there, because I'm sure you can derive based on the comments we made and on the overall guidance that the momentum we see now, three business segments will continue.
Operator: Next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wright: Thanks. In terms of capital deployments here, the share repurchase activity, what's embedded overall on your guidance for 2020-2021, and in terms of the share repurchase activity and have you been active in the fourth quarter to-date, and I guess, on that topic as well, you mentioned it was a largely organic growth that you're pointing to, I just want to clarify, does this guidance assume any acquisition I guess activity consistent with your past practices?
Ari Bousbib: You mean the fourth quarter?
Erin Wright: Fourth quarter and 2021.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So, first of all, congratulations to you, Erin, nice to have you back.
Erin Wright: Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: And secondly, look, we have not done any share repurchase since we suspended our program. So, other than the shares that we repurchased in the first quarter when the last primary sponsor shares were sold and we participated into that secondary, and you know about that. That was in the first quarter pre-pandemic. We haven't done anything since then. I wish we had bought all the shares by the way at $85 a share, but we didn't, and so, we're going to start now optimistically after the earnings release, and there will be probably the markets. We don't have lots of time since we have to start before the end of the year anyway, and with respect to acquisitions, no, I mean there's nothing here for the balance of the year that would be materially different than what we've seen this year, that is relatively negligible M&A activity. In 2021, what's the assumption, Ron…
Ron Bruehlman: Well, you can expect in 2021 we'll spend some on acquisition share repurchase together, we'll trade-off between the two, and our normal assumption there which is valid in 2021 is about a $1.5 billion between the two during the course of the year.
Ari Bousbib: And that's what we had before pandemic. That is what we had before.
Ron Bruehlman: Consistent with past practice.
Erin Wright: Okay, great, and then just cost mitigation efforts and further flexibility, I guess if you do continue to see things get a little bit worse in terms of these flare-ups, there are ample levers you can pull here from a cost mitigation standpoint, correct?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, Erin, you make a very good point, as you know we made a deliberate decision not -- by and large, not to do any restructuring of our workforce. We had maintained employment, and I might add base compensation as well. First of all, the crisis situation dictated that -- you know, that was the right thing to do to focus on our people and take care of our people, and number two, we anticipated the strong V-shaped recovery in Q4 and 2021, and obviously, we wanted to preserve our talents and resources, and so, we've not done anything. Now, obviously, we had any sustained situation that in a systemic way would force us to look at totally different environment for long-term, then we would change that and we do have levers, and the only thing that I can tell you is that we've had strong productivity, despite not reducing our workforce or our base compensation, we've learned like most companies to work remotely. We have very important study going on called the Future of Work internally, and we're trying to determine which roles -- and as you know, we have about 70,000 people. So, there are a lot of different roles in the company, and we are detailing which roles can actually work from home. What we've learnt during this pandemic, what office space do we really need, and if you are going to be behind your workstation all the day not interacting with other people, what's the need for having a physical presence at an office? Again, dependent on the geographies, there are countries where that's just required like in Japan, for example, others not and when we do home assist and so and so forth. So, there will be a lot of questions depending on the roles, and so, there will be changes to our real estate footprint no questions like most companies, but IT investments that we are making, it is to solidified the remote for more capabilities even further et cetera, but again, we've got very significant levers that we have by and large not touched.
Erin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup.
Patrick Donnelly: Thank you for taking the question. Ari, maybe it's on the remote monitoring, virtual trial side, lot of talk about that during the pandemic. I guess do you see general bookings and trials pick back up? Are you seeing any notable shift in activity towards that, or -- I mean how are you guys positioned? Maybe just talk through that.
Ari Bousbib: You are talking about remote? Yes, anybody wants to take this?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes, on the remote monitoring side -- and stop me Patrick if I am not answer your specific question here, but remote monitoring side, we have largely been able to substitute for the work we would otherwise be doing onsite, but not 100% because there are still the requirement to be onsite to check source documentation at the site under FDA guidelines. Now, remote monitoring we should say is different than virtual trials. Virtual trials include patient tele visits, home health nursing, phlebotomy services, user --patient diaries and things of that nature. So, quite different in that regard, so, I think sometimes these two terms are confused, and people are saying that they are doing virtual trials when in fact what they are doing is remote monitoring.
Ari Bousbib: Right, remote monitoring of that which could be monitored remotely which is not everything, right. Not all components of a trial may be monitored remotely. Virtual trial is a trial that has been designed to be virtual, and that doesn't mean that there won't be onsite monitoring visit either, but it uses different technology than has been designed from the start, whereas remote monitoring is a component of regular trials that just happens to be that some of the data -- some of the activities are monitored remotely.
Patrick Donnelly: Okay, that's helpful. I guess just on the TAS business and following up on Bob's question, you guys had lengthy talks about the quality resiliency there. So, it's encouraging to see the high single digit growth this quarter. Outlook certainly seems bullish for 4Q in '21. I guess when we think about '21, continuing this high single digit growth, I guess further one or two key drivers you see there, customer conversations I assume certainly trending positively, but would love just little more granularity on the outlook for next question on that side?
Ari Bousbib: Look, we have developed our guidance on TAS assuming what we see today continues, and there is no reason -- again we see in the worst of the pandemic performed very well. So, certainly when things return to most stable environment, we will continue our high single digit growth trajectory where we are now, and so, there aren't any specific parts of the business. Now remember the data business is zero to low single digit growth and that's kind of very stable. The analytics and services business again was mid to high single digits, and continues so on the high end of that range. The real world business is just on fire to be frank. I mean it was before on fire I mean in a positive way, and firing on all cylinders, and it was already in very strong double digit territory before the pandemic. It continued to be solid double digit territory before the pandemic, and is now expected to continue to grow at that same pace. Technology continues to pick up as the deployments of OCE are well on their way. Going very well I might add, and all of that will start generating the license revenue. We expect not a huge portion of TAS business, but very nice revenue of nice margins. So, all of that will continue, and so, this four segments of our business and when you do that math and you look at the momentum, no, there is no reason to anticipate -- there is no big -- there is no one big good guy that will affect this company's growth rate, and there is no big bad guy that would have said that that's [indiscernible]. Andrew, you have any…
Andrew Markwick: We are approaching the top of the hour. So, I was wondering do we want to squeeze in one more quickly, operator.
Operator: The question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for squeezing me in at the end. I just want to piggyback out at the last question. Ari if you can talk a little bit about more just on the incumbent patients? One of point of time, you mentioned there were like 50,000 seats to deploy. Just like where you are? How long do you think this is going to take, and is there anything changing in terms of competitively, or is it really the same kind of run rates that you had talked about in prior earnings calls?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you, Shlomo. This OCS continued with exactly the same momentum that is moving about two thirds of time. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have now since the beginning of the year won another 45 new clients, and that's now is total of 125 distinct clients. When we talk about the client, I mean it's one company. There are competitors out there that count five different wins with the same client as five. We count that as one. You mentioned 50,000. I think we are now -- correct me if I am wrong, Andrew, at 63 - 64,000.
Andrew Markwick: Maybe just around 63, yes.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, close to 65,000 users in deployment, and we expect that to continue to grow. That's a nice pipeline. Lots of conversations continue to go. So, the momentum here is unabated. No changes. Thank you, Shlomo. Thank you everyone.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks very much. Thank you everyone, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, and as always, Jen and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have throughout the day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would like to now turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ron Bruehlman, who will be Mike's successor, as of August 1; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call, on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call, will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements, due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, including COVID-19 impacts, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we get to the results, I'm sure you all saw the announcement last night, and so this will be Mike's last IQVIA earnings call, and so I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him for his service and wish him well in his new role at Biogen. I also want to thank Ron and welcome him back, he really never left, but I want to thank him for agreeing to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer until we decide on a permanent successor. Many of you already know Ron, and I'm sure you are delighted to welcome him back to the CFO chair. Now to our results; revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings all came in above our guidance ranges. Today, we are also updating our guidance for the year and raising our full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings ranges. Before we review the numbers, I'd like to give you a quick operational update. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical research sites in the R&D solutions business, pretty much in line with what we told you three months ago. Global site access improved to approximately 20% in April, to 40% at the end of June. Average site accessibility for the second quarter was about 30%, again in line with the assumption that we made, when we set our second quarter guidance. The progress of global site reopenings is continuing into the third quarter, and today, it's at 53%. I should point out that the progress has been slowing somewhat in the past couple of weeks, as a result of several localized COVID-19 flare-ups in geographies around the world, and especially, in parts of the United States. As sites have become accessible, we've seen an improvement in the number of onsite monitoring visits. In fact, on-site visits are now exceeding the number of remote visit, and as a result, remote visits have reduced from the peak in the second quarter. Of course, wherever sites are still inaccessible, our ability to deliver solutions like remote monitoring and virtual trials remains critical to ensuring trial continuity. Now, patients who are already enrolled in trials have slowly begun returning for in-person treatment. As you would expect, this varies by therapeutic area. For example, oncology patients are returning at a faster rate than dermatology patients. Also, the recent outbreaks in parts of the U.S. have hampered the pace of recovery in the number of patients enrolled in trials, who are willing to come in for in-person treatment. For trials that have not yet started, the pace of site startup and patients recruitment has obviously been slow. It's improving, but still slow. For example, patient recruitment for new trials, which had been virtually halted during the second quarter, has resumed over the past few weeks, and is now at about 25% of normal baseline enrollment levels. We expect this to continue to improve over time. R&DS business development activity has remained very strong. We still have not had any material cancellations of trials in our backlog, due to COVID-19. Interactions with clients, such as Big Defenses continue, as clients adjust to working virtually. RFP volume and value continue to hold at basically similar levels to 2019. And of course, the R&DS team has been awarded a wide range of COVID-19 vaccine therapeutics and related lab work. Of course, you will have seen, we announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca last week, to accelerate development of a potential COVID vaccine. COVID-19, more broadly has accelerated interest in our virtual trials solution, including Study Hub. Awards for our virtual trial solutions have actually doubled, albeit of a relatively small base. We are leveraging our virtual trial technology platform, Study Hub, to deliver a seamless patient experience. As you know, the platform combined eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication. Moving to Technology & Analytics. We continue to have very little interruption in data, supply or demand. Our data production centers around the world remain fully operational, and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Selling activities have started to resume, as clients have adjusted to working virtually as well. There is still some delayed decision making for ad hoc services work, but we've had real good momentum in our fastest growing businesses, such as Real World and Tech. Our Real World business continues to expand even in this environment, with strong growth in the quarter. As a reminder, the results of our Real World business are reported in our TAS segment. So unlike our CRO peers, this growth is not included in R&DS results. In the Technology space, OCE has added 35 new clients so far in 2020. OCE deployments continue to progress as scheduled, as clients look to accelerate their usage and get up and running on the platform even faster. We now have 115 customers that have chosen OCE, and they represent over 60,000 potential users of the platform. Most of these customers are still in the early stage of deployment. So far, our win rate in this segment when going head-to-head against the incumbent is approximately 70%. Finally, in our CSMS business, we've not experienced any material cancellations. Although, as expected, we've experienced softer demand for field reps, which of course impacts revenue. Additionally, business development has slowed considerably in this segment. Let's now review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $2,521,000,000, which is a $118 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now $41 million of this $118 million beat came from FX and pass-throughs. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $483 million, with a $25 million beat versus the midpoint of our guidance, and this came entirely from better operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.18. Second quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass-throughs grew 13.5% year-over-year to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. We saw good growth in awards for our large pharma clients, as well as our EBP clients in the quarter. We had broad-based booking strength by offering, with particular strength in full service clinical and in lab. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass-throughs was 1.64 for the second quarter of 2020, and excluding pass-throughs, the second quarter contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.60. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at June 30 was 1.43, including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. As we said previously, we've continued to make every effort to preserve employment during this crisis and to the extent possible we have not affected based compensation for our employees. Of course, we've worked to reduce other costs and discretionary spend and as a result of these actions, our adjusted EBITDA came in well above our expectations. You can see, when you adjust for pass-throughs and FX, that the drop through incremental margin on the revenue beat was over 30%. So far, even considering several flare-ups around the world, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Sites are reopening globally, allowing us to resume our critical work in R&DS. We continue to be cautiously optimistic, and we anticipate a sharp recovery in the back end of the year. Mike will review in more detail how we see the second half playing out. Finally, a quick update on our 2021 planning process. As I've already shared with you, we started this process earlier than usual and our plan is to provide 2021 guidance before the end of this year. Given the positive trends we've seen in operational execution and client demand, together with catch-up work and the associated change orders that we currently anticipate, as well as the COVID awards, we remain optimistic that in 2021, we will see a return to our previous growth trajectory. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike for some more detail on the quarter, how we see the second half of the year play out, and the upward revisions to our guidance.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Turning first to revenue; second quarter revenue was $2.521 billion compared to $2.740 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue was $5.275 billion compared to $5.424 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter revenue in Technology & Analytics Solutions was $1.109 billion compared to $1.102 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.226 billion compared with $2.177 billion for the first half of 2019. R&D Solutions second quarter revenue was $1.235 compared with $1.435 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue in R&D Solutions was $2.676 billion compared with $2.851 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $177 million compared with $203 million in the second quarter of 2019. First half contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $373 million compared to $396 million in the first half of 2019. Turning now to profit, adjusted EBITDA was $483 million for the second quarter, and $1.045 billion for the first half. Second quarter GAAP net loss was $23 million, resulting in a $0.12 loss per diluted share. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $59 million or $0.30 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $229 million for the second quarter or $1.18 per share. Adjusted net income for the first half was $523 million or $2.68 per share. Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog; closing backlog grew 13.5% to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. New business wins remain strong and to-date we have experienced no material COVID-19 related cancellations. Let's now review the balance sheet; at June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion and debt was $12.1 billion, resulting in net debt of approximately $11 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our net leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 4.8 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, as a result of the COVID-19 related impacts on our first half adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, we continue to be committed to bringing our leverage ratio to a range of 3.5 to 4 times, as we exit 2022. Cash flow from operating activities was $472 million in the second quarter and $635 million year-to-date. CapEx for the quarter was $142 million, $283 million year-to-date, and free cash flow for the quarter was $330 million or $352 million year-to-date. As you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter, and as of June 30 of 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We will continue to evaluate the right time to reinitiate our share repurchase program. We continue to have strong liquidity. At June 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. We also have over $1 billion of EBITDA cushion, relative to our leverage and interest coverage maintenance covenants, even as our first half adjusted EBITDA has suffered a significant and unusual impact from COVID-19. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases. And now, let's move to guidance; on our first quarter earnings call, we outlined our assumptions regarding the global progression of the virus, the percentage of clinical research sites accessible to us throughout 2020, and our ability to interact with clients to support business development activities. These assumptions supported our 2020 guidance provided at that time. During the second quarter, it became apparent that the global spread of the virus would become wider and more prolonged than we had assumed. However, the percentage of sites accessible to us, tracked in line with our expectations, and business development activities have progressed better than our original assumptions. We also had made the assumption at the time that 100% of clinical research sites would be accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter. However, given localized flare-ups around the world, we now see this happening more at the beginning of 2021. But, in spite of this, we have been able to overcome restricted site access better than we initially thought, through work around, including the use of our remote capabilities. Based on our better than expected performance in the second quarter, the company's ability to execute in this environment, incremental COVID-19 trial work and evaluation of current business conditions and outlook for the balance of the year, we are now forecasting better performance in our TAS segment and better execution against our R&DS backlog than previously anticipated. Together, these factors are expected to contribute to improved financial performance in 2020 versus the company's expectations on April 28, 2020. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance ranges for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be between $11 billion and $11,100,000,000, which represents an increase of approximately $290 million at the midpoint, of which approximately 20% represents a favorable FX impact based on exchange rates as of the end of the second quarter. Please note that FX still represents a year-over-year headwind of 60 basis points on our average revenue guidance. At the midpoint of the new guidance range, the constant currency growth represents slight growth year-over-year. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,295,000,000 and $2,345,000,000 and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $6.10 and $6.30. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at the end of the second quarter remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of 2020. Assuming FX rates at the end of the second quarter remain constant through the end of the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2,725,000,000 and $2,775,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $564 million and $582 million. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.47 and $1.55. So in summary, we delivered second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the top end of our guidance ranges. We are seeing encouraging signs of a migration back to normal business conditions by the end of the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We have raised our guidance for the full year, and we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory. And finally, as Ari mentioned at the start of the call, this is my last earnings call with IQVIA. I am very grateful for the opportunity to serve as IQVIA's Chief Financial Officer since our merger. It's been a privilege to work with Ari and the executive leadership team. I have learned a lot over the past four years, and I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished. I firmly believe IQVIA is incredibly well positioned to achieve its Vision 2022 ambitions. I intend to remain a shareholder in the company and will be rooting for its continued success. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
George Hill: You covered a lot. I guess, the first question I would ask is, have you seen any change in the competitive environment as it relates to COVID-19? And I know you haven't any cancellations and the win rate’s been strong. But I guess just talk about how the selection process is going and whether you guys think you're taking share.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, George. Good morning. Again, when we refer to no material cancellations related to COVID-19, we are speaking about cancellations of trials that were already in the backlog and not for COVID, for other things. And it just points to the resilience of our customers and their long-term view. They haven't changed their priorities, and they are still focused on the diseases that they were focused on before the crisis emerged. With respect to COVID-19 itself, we've won a wide variety of the trials, ranging from small lab work or - all the way to wide vaccine trials. A number of those are - I mean, are well publicized. There are a few large ones. Some of them are nominal fees related to product reviews for small biopharma companies. There are multimillion-dollar vaccine trials. There are currently two vaccine trials that are funded by the U.S. government. So operational work speed, which we have won, one of which we mentioned - I mentioned in my introductory remarks, which is the one with AstraZeneca. So in terms of competitive wins, I think the crisis has shown that our unique capabilities are highly, highly differentiated. All I can say is, we've become a lot closer to the customer base during this crisis, with many of them we had weekly forum. We've got extraordinary feedback from our customers in terms of the criticality of the information we were providing them in realtime for their own decision-making process. And we've continued to win at a very high pace. I believe that we've continued to gain market share. And certainly, we gained a significant amount of the overall COVID-19 work out there. And I want to point out that this COVID-19-related work is - we are contributing as well to the resolution of the crisis. And so in many cases, because these are government-sponsored, we are discounting those. So they are important, and they are going to continue to play a role in the foreseeable future here. And they were a part of our bookings in the quarter. I believe they represent somewhere in the teens of our service bookings in the quarter, sort of mid-teens or so. And so it's not a negligible piece of our dollar bookings but - it wasn't a 'make it or break it' kind of set of activities.
George Hill: And maybe if I could ask, Mike, a quick follow-up. And Mike, you're going to be missed there at IQVIA. Remote monitoring has played a huge part of the process as we've gone through the COVID crisis. I guess can you talk a little bit about the financial implications of moving to the remote environment versus the on-site environment?
Michael McDonnell: You're asking about the remote environment versus - yes. I mean, look, we - as I said in my remarks, the remote monitoring, obviously, is where everyone went. And in order - because we could simply not access the site, I think that, as I said in my remarks, on-site visits have replaced - are now overcome the number of remote visits. The peak of those remote visits were sometime in the May, June time frame. And now we have started accelerating in a steep fashion the number of actual visits. We're still not to our normal pace, but it has dramatically increased. As I said, 53% of the sites are now accessible, and we are able to visit those sites. Bear in mind, while remote is helpful and then we are using it mostly to meet obligations to patients and clients and to ensure their safety, et cetera but again, it's important to know that in-person site visits are still required in order to meet the source data verification criteria, the - each trial budget, of course, will have to be revised accordingly. So we see this as more of an opportunity as well as we go back to site. Thank you, George.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. I appreciate all the color. I guess, Ari, on the reopening of site, I’m just curious about how much risk you see in the flare-up of cases, now heading into 3Q in the back half of the year and other implications to R&DS and CSMS for your business and other steps you can take in anticipation of some of this to try to mitigate the impact.
Ari Bousbib: CSMS? Did you mention CSMS or - what's the question?
Tycho Peterson: The question was about the flare-up of COVID cases and the risk heading into 3Q in the back half of the year and the steps you can take to mitigate some of that in advance and then just any - where you would see more impact.
Michael McDonnell: Was that Tycho who's asked? Was that George still?
Tycho Peterson: No. It's Tycho.
Michael McDonnell: Tycho, sorry. We're having trouble hearing on our end.
Tycho Peterson: The question is about the flare-up in COVID cases and risks for 3Q in the back half of the year and other steps you can take to mitigate some of the impact these cases are going back up in a number of regions.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, there's flare-ups out there, Texas, Florida, California, South Carolina, around the world. I mean Europe and certainly Asia is pretty much back up to not quite 100%, but not that far. The main issue here is, in some parts of the United States - but, again, we don't disclose exactly which sites are where, but you should know that it's not going to be that material, these flare-ups in the U.S. to our - we have over 100,000 sites globally. And we've become very adept at transitioning to remote monitoring. So, I think - yes, I mean, we now have been able during the second quarter, to adapt, and we have a number of workarounds using our remote capabilities. And so, we feel that these assumptions that we made for the third quarter, I think, are, in a way, better educated than the ones that we made three months ago, when we were just learning to adapt to the crisis. I should point out that these assumptions that we made in April 2020, many folks out there thought that we were getting ahead of ourselves and we’re maybe too optimistic about those assumptions. And the fact is, the progression of site accessibility as a metric was exactly as we predicted. And we base that on the course of the disease in China and other geographies that were more - that had been ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the disease. And we base that also on our own internal data and modeling that we are using to project our business. So, once again, while people thought we were overly optimistic, it turned out we were exactly on target with respect to site accessibility and, in fact, not so optimistic. So, I think, I'm not suggesting that, because we were right three months ago, we are right now for the next three months. But, I think, we - if anything, I believe, we are a little bit more educated now, and our models are even more precise than they were three months ago.
Tycho Peterson: And then Ari, one follow-up. You talked about a return to normal growth next year. 15% growth off 630 would be 725 and essentially where consensus is. Is that the right way to be thinking about it for next year?
Ari Bousbib: I said that we are going to give guidance for 2021, much earlier than before than usual. That is not at the beginning of the year more this year for next year, and that is because, as you correctly point out, we have visibility. We have more visibility than usual because we know of the work that should have been done this year that's still in our books that we need to progress plus the work that we want this year, so we have more visibility. I'm not going to give you any numbers. I'll let you speculate, but hopefully in a not too distant future I mean, I don't know if we'll be able to do this in the third quarter, but maybe we should have that as a goal, okay? We're getting there in terms of our 2021 plans. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Robert Jones: Thanks for the question. And yes Mike, definitely enjoyed working with you. Good luck in the next endeavor, and now look forward to engaging. I guess maybe Ari, just on that last line of questions, but maybe to put some numbers around it. The second half revenue guidance looks like it implies about 2% year-over-year growth in total revenue over the back half of 2019? But you updated the NTM revenue, expect it to convert at a backlog is, I think up 10% versus the last update with 2Q. Is that - does that dynamic get at what you just commented on that you have just better visibility into the backlog and what could come out of the backlog in the first half of 2021?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean - Andrew, do you want to take?
Andrew Markwick: Yes sure. Yes, I mean yes, the next 12 months revenue from backlog increased considerably quarter-over-quarter. It was $4.9 billion at the end of Q1 and now sits at $5.4 billion, a large sequential move. And I think that's the ultimate forward-looking indicator for future revenue growth in the trajectory of the business. So we're very pleased with that. I think obviously, we still want to dig into our plans when we started with that process, as Ari said earlier. And we're looking forward to providing 2021 guidance, but I think...
Ari Bousbib: Yes but Bob, I think you're thinking about it the right way. Part of this is the fact that this - as you know, we won I believe, a disproportionate piece of the market over the past year or so. And those market share gains have translated into a big proportion of our backlog that's new wins that are - haven't started. And so a big piece, which is why you saw the revenue conversion being slower than usual even without the COVID-19 crisis. That's because site start-up activity is typically a little slower. Patient enrollment is a little slower. The vast majority of our book of business is not in the sweet spot, so to speak, where the trial is ongoing. And so the COVID-19 crisis has added to this issue because when you think about the impact of the crisis on trials for patients that were already enrolled. And for trials that are in that phase, where you are really - in the sweet spot and executing the trial and patients with insights. Then we worked around that with - you can work around with remote monitoring. And now we're returning patients to sites, et cetera. But sites that had not started yet, site start-up activity is - was much more difficult, simply because people were just not at work, and we weren't able to get the site up and running. So that has been delayed, and it's kind of slowed down a bit. Similarly, patient enrollment was more difficult and is more difficult. We are now enrolling, as I said in my introductory remarks, patients back into trial. But we still are only at 25% of normal baseline number of patients recruited per week. So it's going up, and we're catching up. And I think that's part of why you see more revenue pushed back into the next 12 months. That's kind of the pent-up, if you will, revenue that should have been executed - that's now going to be executed. And that's in addition, of course, to the change orders for the work that needs to be done. I mentioned before, we need to do on-site data verification. So despite the remote visits, a piece of the work - still needs to be done on site. So that's additional. And then finally, we continue to book at a very high pace, as shown by our high book-to-bill ratios. As all of that adds up to what we believe is the expected next 12 months revenue from backlog.
Robert Jones: No, that all makes a ton of sense. And I guess maybe just a quick follow-up Ari, on TAS. Maybe just - I know you touched on some of the elements there in the prepared remarks, but clearly better performance than many expected. What are clients specifically utilizing within the segment I know there's a lot of components there. Is it the analytics for virtual meetings? Is it more safety studies? Just trying to get a better sense of what was driving the performance in TAS?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean look, the usual thing, data technology, Real-World as well. I mean, why don't I turn to Ron, you want to add here?
Ron Bruehlman: Yes look, the strongest part of the TAS segment has been and remains Real-World. We've also seen continued implementations in the tech sector that's gone well. Analytics solutions actually has been strong, although there have been some delayed client decisions as a result of COVID. So I would say, across the board, but there is particular strength that we see is in Real-World.
Ari Bousbib: And again, the weakness in TAS, as we said before, is the part of the business where we help clients organize face-to-face meetings with physicians, healthcare professionals around the world, the conference business that requires in-person, and that has essentially dried out. It's beginning interestingly, to show signs of revival. People are scheduling conferences in the next few quarters. So that's going to come back. But, certainly, it's been largely brought to a hold and that has created a hole in our revenue, which is why TAS hasn't performed as greatly as, but everything else I think, has done very good.
Ron Bruehlman: Yes everything, yes [TAS] and data remains very solid.
Ari Bousbib: Very stable, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is now open.
Patrick Donnelly: Maybe just a follow-up on the TAS question there certainly, appreciate Real-World doing well. Can you just give us a bit more color on OCE? I know you kind of noted 35 new clients so far in 2020. Can you just discuss how that's trending relative to your expectations? And then again, maybe some of the feedback you're getting from customers that are either converting over to you or kind of competitive wins, what you're hearing about the offering there?
Ari Bousbib: So again, the team has really performed very well. We've crossed the 100-customer mark, and now we're at 115 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. Generally, with a handful of exceptions, we're not seeing any slowdowns in implementation actually in many cases accelerations of implementations. We went live for several deployments, including by the way, in the midst of the crisis. I remember seeing - I think I saw an e-mail somewhat from one of our large, large, large clients, congratulating the team for an amazing job they did on deploying in Spain in the middle of the - peak - the COVID crisis over there. So, things have tended to go very well on our deployment. Generally, the demand for remote detailing continues to rise. We've got a module within OCE - called OCE Remote Detailing, which is the most secure compliance platform in the space. We also launched last quarter our compliance solution in the commercial space, HCP engagement management, which already has four wins. And a strong pipeline has been building. So I think it's all going very well according to expectations. And frankly for OCE, we haven't seen any - a few - again a handful of slowdowns in terms of some areas where we couldn't redeploy. But on the other hand, we've seen acceleration. So it's essentially going as well as we could have expected.
Patrick Donnelly: And then maybe just one on the margin side, you guys did a pretty good job insulating the bottom line from some of the revenue headwinds, are pretty quick to do some cost controls. I know you talked about planning for 2021 already. I guess how should we think about some of the costs that have come out? Are those going to come back in terms of your planning? Are you feeling good enough, to your point there, Ari, I think you talked a few times about the visibility? Now that you're more comfortable there, are you kind of easing on some of the cost controls? Maybe just help us think about kind of the margin cadence and the go-forward, the cost control measures that you have in place? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, yes. I mean do you want to - Ron, you want to...
Ron Bruehlman: Yes sure. Look obviously there is some margin pressure in the first half due to the drop in revenue and how quickly we could get costs out more so and early on and later on. We should see margin expansion in the second half of the year as the business comes back. We've taken a lot of cost out. I don't think all of it's going to come back. Certainly, we're going to continue to try to keep pressure on keeping T&E costs down. And I think naturally, they will in this COVID crisis. And we're always looking to take out - to improve efficiency wherever we can. One of the things that we've looked at very carefully other than T&E, which obviously has fallen off, is renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing third-party spend. And we're reassessing our office space needs, which I think a lot of companies are doing right now. So I think that the cost trends will be positive going forward as will margin progression.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean again, you can see we have a large cost base. And so as for me, the situation becomes worse, there are many levers that we can use to mitigate impact to profit. And again, I want to emphasize, we have not taken any virtually, no action with respect to employment. There are very, very small pockets, really affecting a few hundred employees, where there were furloughs or there were a few restructurings, but nothing out of the ordinary course. Nothing dramatic and we do not plan to do so. And the reason for that is, again, we are a people-based business. We're a services company, and we want to protect our employees. We know they're going through difficult times. And then secondly, we do expect a V-shaped recovery and a very strong - well here I go I'm talking about 2021. I didn't want to, but we expect a strong 2021, and we are going to need our very talented employees. So we didn't take any base compensation or restructuring actions as a result of the crisis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is now open.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks, good morning Mike, good luck with your future endeavors. A couple of quick questions here, but first off, I heard in the Q&A, a mention of particular strength in Real-World evidence. Last quarter, I believe you highlighted that RWE could be a tale of two cities, prospective and retrospective work, with the prospective work looking more like trials? There could be some headwind. What changed there, if anything or what were the dynamics between the old IMS RWE and the old Quintiles' RWE business mix?
Ari Bousbib: Well that's a very, it’s very - okay I don't want to flatter you too much. It's a very thoughtful question. And you're right, to - your understanding why yes, we are doing well in Real-World. And that is that the ability to use patient-level data, which I'll remind you, is really an unparalleled asset at our company. We have now - we did over 800 million patient lives - unique patient lives, which have been extremely useful. The unique E360 technology capabilities enable us to conduct a lot of retrospective studies. And that part of the business has been extremely strong. The second factor is that, while access to sites has also been restricted, but it is less restricted than a clinical trial site. To a degree, there are many Real-World studies where the sites are actually doctor offices, as opposed to hospitals and those have tended to have - while restricted still and many of them were shut down, as you know, but access - physical access was better than we would have thought. And the experience has proven that the site accessibility for Real-World is somewhat better than for clinical trial sites. So as a result Real-World has done, again, better than we would have expected. Bear in mind also, when we report site accessibility metrics, we only report for clinical trials. And as you know, our competitors, our CRO peers report those numbers in aggregate.
Eric Coldwell: Yes, helpful thank you. IQV is one of two companies in the space that reports authorizations on a contracted basis. I think there was some speculation that you could have strong awards, but maybe contracts would be pushed out given the global uncertainty and clients putting out fires. Clearly, that was not a big headwind, but I am curious, what is the normal lag from award to contract at IQV? My hunch would be maybe a couple of months, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. And then how has that changed in - this COVID environment? We know the COVID specific trials are being contracted extremely quickly, but have you seen other changes in the duration between award and contract time?
Ari Bousbib: Well, your general assumption is correct okay. You're kind of two months' lag time. We're trying to reduce that. But that kind of 60-day period is a good assumption. The lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, okay. So the lag between award and contracting could be up to 60 days, 30 to 60 days, let's say. And the lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, six months to 12 months, depending on the client, the study dynamics. And of course, the COVID situation has pushed that lag between booking and revenue further simply because we were unable to get sites started. But we are going - we are getting back into it as we speak. And certainly in Asia, we are already back up to normal, and we expect that to happen with a three to six-month lag in the rest of the world, Europe and then U.S. So yes, I mean, it has created some delays in execution. On the other hand, as you suggested COVID-19 trials are much faster burn, but it has partially begun to offset that.
Ron Bruehlman: Eric, one thing.
Eric Coldwell: Yes.
Ron Bruehlman: Both awards and contracted bookings were very strong in the quarter. So either way you look at it…
Ari Bousbib: Yes, Ron makes a good point. I mean I don't want to - you remember the old way of reporting book-to-bills, which was basically on awards. And if we had done that this quarter, did I say - it would be having - materially higher than the 1.64, materially higher on awards - I mean awards basis.
Eric Coldwell: Very helpful, last one, just a clarification. There were some phone issues in one of your earlier responses. Did I hear you say that COVID work in total across therapies and vaccines accounted for mid-teens of your contracted awards?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, in services yes, yes.
Eric Coldwell: Yes, okay. Great, thanks guys.
Andrew Markwick: Okay. Operator, I think we're up to the top of the hour now. So I think we've run out of time for the call. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Jen and I we are available to take any questions that you may have for the rest of the day.
Ari Bousbib: And Mike and Ron.
Andrew Markwick: Yes. Mike and Ron will join us as well.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, thank you, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentation section of IQVIA's Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, including impacts from COVID-19, which is discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. @ And finally, please bear with us as we're conducting this call from various remote locations. We will do our best to make sure the call goes smoothly.  I would now like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is safe and well. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to apologize in advance that, given the crisis, I will be a little longer in my narratives today in an effort to provide you a good amount of color on what we're seeing on the ground. Of course, as always, if we don't have time to get to your questioning, our team is available to answer questions after the call. Today, we will review our first quarter performance. We will also provide guidance for the second quarter and update our full year guidance in light of COVID-19.  First, let's review how we've been navigating the challenges over the last couple of months. We've instituted a precrisis management structure to ensure that we align on priorities across the organization. I've been meeting every day with my senior leadership team. As disclosed, communication has allowed us to be agile and decisive in our response to the crisis, and collectively, we're currently centered around four priorities.  First, the safety of our employees, patients, health care professionals, customers, suppliers with whom we frequently interact. To limit exposure, of course, we prohibited substantially all travel, supplied PPE to field-based employees, closed facilities and have most of our staff to work remotely. We've added bandwidth VPN capacity to our advanced infrastructure to enable remote working and avoid service disruptions.  Second, as clinics and hospitals have become inaccessible and has become unsafe or difficult for patients to travel, we've continued to do everything in our power to mitigate disruptions to clinical trials and ensure patient safety. Wherever possible, we have been transitioning to remote monitoring with the number of remote monitoring visits reaching 5x the level they were prior to the crisis. We have leveraged our existing drug delivery and home health services for activities such as at-home lab draws. Perhaps we could -- but whenever we could, we've been enabling telehealth visits to ensure continuity of contact between investigator, patients and CRAs, and we've been transitioning portions of trials to Study Hub, our virtual trial platform.  Third, to help our clients and other organizations manage and plan for the outbreak, we're deploying our unique capabilities. For example, we are applying our people, data and technology to bring AI and insights to help our clients track the progression of the disease, manage capacity and monitor supply chains. We are actively engaged with clients through regular executive briefings, 3 weekly market tracking reports, white papers, thought leadership pieces and webinars to help them understand the rapidly evolving dynamics of the outbreak and to predict how things will develop.  Finally, we're joining the global response to the crisis and contributing our resources to its resolution. Last week, for example, in the U.K., on behalf of Department of Health, we joined with the Office of National Statistics, Oxford University and the U.K. Biocentre. We immediately commenced a countrywide testing program of U.K. households for COVID-19 infection and immunity. In Asia, we provided an IQVIA team to have developed 2 new treatments for COVID-19 using existing HIV and flu vaccines. In the U.S., we're partnering with the University of Texas to develop new lab tests to identify vaccine candidates quicker than currently available tests. In the U.S. and Europe, we are collaborating with governments and the industry to develop several experimental vaccine candidates using our prime site networks and data assets to accelerate time line. We are, of course, involved in multiple trials for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines, which I will talk more about later.  During this critical time, we continue to innovate. Two weeks ago, our R&D team launched the first technology-enabled COVID-19 trial matching solution at c19trials.com. This online platform will connect at-risk individuals and researchers to ongoing COVID-19 clinical research projects within the U.S. In addition, the Real-World team launched the IQVIA CARE Project registry. The platform will apply our vast experience with registries and analytics to help connect stakeholders and advance information sharing to better understand how to treat and prevent the disease. If successful, all of these will bring much in the certain treatments to patients.  Now before I'll review the results of the quarter, let's take a look at some of the operational impacts to our business caused by the virus. It is important to note, across all of our segments, we view the impacts from the virus as temporary. Client demand and interest in our differentiated offerings remain strong even if their own ability to move forward on projects is hampered or delayed.  In R&DS, site start-up patient recruitment are the most impacted part of the clinical trial life cycle. Site monitoring visits have also been impacted. As of today, only 20% of our global sites are currently accessible to our CRAs for on-site monitoring visits. On the other hand, data collection and regulatory reporting activities are more or less continuing with little interruption.  For in-site trials, we are coordinating closely with local health authorities and customers to deploy, when appropriate and feasible, our services and technologies to further increase remote-based CRA and centralized monitoring for trials and remote patient visits. As site access remains constrained, we are seeing an uptick in demand for e-consent, virtual trials, eCOA and connected devices. When the crisis subsides, we anticipate that some trials will require minimal additional work to satisfy requirements over and above the remote visits. But the vast majority, substantially, most of the other trials, will require CRAs to go on-site and perform the task of checking documentation, et cetera, that we would not have performed safely during the crisis.  R&D business development activity has remained strong. We have not had a single COVID-related cancellation. RFPs are holding strong at levels that are in line with 2019, which was a record year, and our qualified pipeline remains at a record high. Face-to-face interactions with clients is the obvious challenge. Big defenses, for example, have been delayed with some new business activity getting pushed to the right.  In Technology & Analytics, we had no interruptions in data supply or demand. Our data production centers remain fully operational and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Conversely, the parts of the business that rely on face-to-face interactions or are dependent on in-person gathering events or conferences are experiencing disruption. The prospective portion of our Real-World business that requires site monitoring activity has also been impacted. That said, given the higher proportion of recurring revenue in the TAS segment, it remains relatively well insulated. Business development activity, however, has been somewhat hampered as decisions are being delayed due to the situation.  Finally, CSMS did not see much of an impact in the first quarter. And what's happening here is that clients are reluctant to alter their commercial footprint in anticipation that the crisis will subside in the near term, and as a result, we have not seen any significant cancellations at this stage. We are, of course, also trying to deliver services remotely through e-detailing and virtual meetings. However, activity has become much more challenging due to a decline in sales rep visits and, of course, physical attention being focused -- physician attention being focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Business development has also become challenging in CSMS due to delayed decision-making and reduced RFP flow.  Now against this backdrop, let's review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $2.754 billion and was slightly higher than our most recent guidance range. The revenue beat was mostly driven by pass-through, which came in a little higher than we have anticipated. From a segment perspective, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue came in at $1.170 billion. Constant currency growth was 5.5%. R&D Solutions was $1.441 billion, up 2.4% at constant currency, and excluding a pass-through headwind of approximately 300 basis points, services growth would have been over 5%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue in the quarter was $196 million and grew 2.6% at constant currency, essentially as we originally expected. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $562 million and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.50.  Now I want to highlight bookings growth in R&DS, which was impressive by any standard, but especially so given the broader backdrop. First quarter contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 14% year-over-year to $19.6 billion at March 31, 2020. In the first quarter, awards and net business -- net new business was strong across the board. LTM contracted net new business, including pass-throughs, at March 31 was up 7.5% compared to LTM new business at the end of last year. The contracted book-to-bill ratio, including pass-throughs, was 1.42 for the first quarter of 2020. And excluding pass-throughs, the first quarter contracted book-to-bill was 1.35. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at March 31 was 1.43 including pass-throughs and 1.36 excluding pass-throughs.  The team was, of course, awarded a number of COVID-19 treatment and vaccine trial during the first quarter, most of which are not in our contracted bookings or backlog that I just mentioned. In fact, between treatments and vaccines, we are currently working on 36 COVID-19 awards with a pipeline of 70 other potential projects. Of course, these projects are generally heavily discounted. We are contributing to the general effort against COVID-19 so they won't represent much of our bookings. Importantly, a significant number of these studies entail transformative trial design, including several with government sponsorship and many using the Real-World comparator arm, which IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver, on behalf of our customers.  As dramatic as this crisis is, it will eventually subside. It will not change our industry's fundamental dynamics, and in fact, I believe the prospects for our industry are better than ever. We all know some industries will experience a permanent loss of revenue due to their short-cycle or consumer-oriented nature. However, we are a long-cycle business serving the critical needs of the pharma industry. We've got good visibility into our long-term business due to our backlog and pipeline. In our case, work is just being pushed to the right.  This crisis is a reminder of how critical the pharmaceutical industry is to society. Patients will continue to require innovative new medicines and is no viable substitution for drug discovery. We have an enormous role to play in helping our clients bring life-saving treatments to patients. For example, every year, 100 million patients are treated in oncology, 500 million patients for cardiovascular disease and, at any given time, more than 250 million people suffer from more than 6,000 rare diseases. The need for our customers to use real-world data, advanced analytics and technology, combined with therapeutic expertise to accelerate clinical trial time lines and to launch new medicines has become even more evident during this crisis. We will be even more relevant to our customers than we were before the crisis started.  While the course of the virus is uncertain and no one knows for sure how the balance of the year will develop, one could, of course, step back and say, well, let's suspend guidance and see what happens. But we believe it is incumbent on us to have a point of view and to make assumptions about what our business looks like as we navigate this disruption. And our current point of view is that the business will snap back as the crisis subsides, hopefully later this year and certainly into 2021.  Given these assumptions about the future, we're focused on maintaining our operational capability as we navigate through the crisis. We are, of course, taking aggressive actions to manage our costs in line with revenue declines while also ensuring we are ready for a quick recovery. We've stopped renewing temporary employment contracts in the second quarter. We've renegotiated real estate leases and vendor contracts. We've deferred some of our projects. We stopped much of our discretionary third-party spend and many similar actions to control costs. However, for now, we will do our best to preserve employment and, to the extent we can, to not affect base compensation for our employees. We want to take care of our employees as much as possible, especially in these difficult times. They are our greatest assets, and we need to stick together in anticipation of the strong rebound we are expecting in demand for our services.  Many companies are announcing broad-based reductions in pay affecting significant proportions of their staff. We're taking a somewhat more nuanced approach. We've, of course, offer some employees who need the time-off during this difficult time the option of a reduced work week. In very small parts of our business where utilization has dropped very significantly, we are implementing temporary partial work with corresponding pay reductions. In total to date, approximately 650 people, employees, have either requested time-off or been asked to take time-off. This represents less than 1% of our total workforce. Obviously, should the recovery be delayed and our assumptions prove to be materially different from our current -- from reality, we are, of course, prepared to make more drastic decisions if conditions on the ground defer. For now, the rest of our 67,000-plus employees will not see any broad mandatory-based compensation reductions.  Separately, and as an expression of solidarity with all those affected by the crisis, we are launching a temporary voluntary pay reduction program this quarter for the most senior executives across the company ranging from 10% for SVPs to 20% for my direct reports and to 50% for the CEO. These executive pay cuts will be used entirely to fund IQVIA CARE, a new COVID-19 relief program we're launching this week. The proceeds from these executive pay cuts will be distributed to lower pay level colleagues who are facing family hardships as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Finally, I want to highlight to you that at the same time as we are focused on managing the crisis and helping our organization navigate through these difficult times, we have also, in parallel, started our annual planning process for next year much earlier than usual. This is normally an end-of-summer through end-of-year activity, though we have already started engaging our leadership team and our business units in planning for 2021 based on various scenarios of recovery. While we usually provide annual guidance at the beginning of the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings, we hope this year to provide 2021 guidance earlier than usual.  Now I will turn it over to Mike for some detail on the quarter and the assumptions we've laid out for the remainder of 2020. Mike?
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari. Good morning, everyone, and I also hope that you're staying safe and healthy. Let's start with revenue. First quarter revenue of $2.754 billion grew 3.7% at constant currency and 2.6% reported. As Ari noted, revenue outperformed our revised first quarter guidance due to greater-than-expected pass-throughs, which, as we have said, are very hard to predict. Technology & Analytics Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.117 billion grew 5.5% at constant currency and 3.9% reported. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.441 billion grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.8% reported. First quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $196 million grew 2.6% on a constant currency basis and 1.6% reported.  Turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $562 million for the first quarter. First quarter GAAP net income was $82 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42. Adjusted net income was $294 million for the first quarter or $1.50 per share.  Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at March 31, 2020, was $19.6 billion. New business wins remain strong, and to date, we have not experienced any COVID-19 related cancellations.  Let's now review the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $927 million and debt was approximately $12 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.1 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.7x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $163 million in the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $141 million, and free cash flow for the quarter was $22 million. A reminder, the first quarter is seasonally our lightest free cash flow quarter. To date, we have not experienced any collection delays related to COVID-19.  Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak becoming a pandemic in March, the company had repurchased $321 million of its common stock in the first quarter, including the purchase of 1 million shares in connection with the February 2020 private resale by certain stockholders. Since the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we have temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.  We continue to have strong liquidity. At March 31, we had over $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolver. Our first maturity of any size is not until 2023, which is our term loan A held by a consortium of our relationship banks. We also have approximately $1 billion of EBITDA cushion on one of our maintenance covenants in our credit agreement and about $1.1 billion under the other. Our senior secured net leverage ratio must be below 4x and at March 31, it was 2.17x. Our interest coverage must be above 3.5x, and as of March 31, we were at 5.92x. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases and which would typically equate to about $2 billion per year.  Before we turn to guidance, it will be useful to take a closer look at the COVID-19 situation in China. In China, there were about 8 weeks of a public health emergency from January to March, during which about 80% of our clinical research sites in China were inaccessible. After that 8-week period, activity started to return to normal outside of the Hubei province, and by the end of March, about 40% of our sites were inaccessible. As we moved into April, services outside of Hubei returned to normal with nearly 100% of clinical research sites becoming accessible during May.  As we recap our 2020 guidance, we have used what we have seen in China as a reference point, and we are using a proprietary model with predictive analytics and AI, which is guiding our forecast. All models rely on the accuracy of the inputs used in the model, and the future course of the virus is inherently uncertain.  Despite this uncertainty, we have used our best efforts to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business. And when resetting 2020 guidance, we've assumed that new cases of the virus continue to increase globally through the second quarter then level off and begin to decline by the end of the quarter. This slide here shows the number of active cases per 100,000 people, but the curves of the number of new cases or symptomatic cases would be similar. We expect that business activity begins to recover during the third quarter as access to clinical research sites resumes gradually during the quarter with a return to 100% functionality at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, with the exception of China, most of the company's offices are closed and substantially all of the IQVIA employees are working remotely. Because this is also the case with our clients, business development and execution activities, especially when they require face-to-face interaction, have been inhibited. We assume that commercial activity gradually resumes throughout the second and third quarters and returns to normal by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, approximately 80% of our clinical research sites are inaccessible. We assume the number of inaccessible sites will average about 70% through the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect an average of 35% of sites to be inaccessible with all sites open and accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Based on those assumptions, we are revising our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Full year revenue is now expected to be between $10.6 billion to $10.925 billion. The new revenue guidance includes an unfavorable $75 million impact to reflect FX rates as of April 24. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.75 per share and $6.10 per share. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at April 24, 2020, remain in effect for the rest of the year.  Now turning to guidance for the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the assumptions that we laid out for our full year guidance, including the assumption that business starts to return to normal in some parts of the world in the third quarter, we are expecting the second quarter will have the biggest impact from COVID-19, representing approximately half of the expected total impact for the year. Assuming FX rates at April 24, 2020, remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.365 billion and $2.440 million. Note that FX is expected to be a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 150 basis points in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $445 million and $470 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1 per share and $1.09 per share. You should note in the second half of 2020 of the remaining impact from COVID-19, we expect approximately 75% to be weighted to the third quarter.  And so in summary, continued strength in new business wins position us well for a return to strong growth and the momentum we had earlier in the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We are engaging with clients around the world at a much higher level and frequency than ever before. We are taking cost actions to mitigate the impact, have decided to prioritize operational capability in anticipation of the return to normal later this year. We expect the migration back to normal business conditions by the beginning of the fourth quarter, but the second quarter bearing most of the impact from COVID-19. And we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory.  And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. 
Tycho Peterson: Ari, I'm just wondering if you can talk to the mitigation efforts, what percentage has actually moved to virtual enrollment and remote monitoring at this point and how comfortable the FDA is maybe switching trials mid course to more remote monitoring. If you could just talk to those dynamics.
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you. But the -- on your question, about 50%, I would say, moved to remote monitoring. Obviously, the FDA has issued guidance on how we should do remote monitoring. The guidelines are extremely beneficial that provide a way to enable remote approaches to monitor patients and site data. Obviously, you have to check that they're taking their medication and so on.  We built the industry's largest central monitoring organization, and it's across 5 global locations. It supports our remote monitoring capability. We have hundreds of already successfully executed risk-based monitoring studies, RBM studies, in which remote monitoring has been the key component. This is before the crisis. And we complete thousands of remote monitoring visits successfully every year, and the number is growing. So we were happy with the FDA guidance.  There are, of course -- I just -- besides, there are trials where remote monitoring of data is not always an option. Even when the technology and complexity of the -- and the regulatory infrastructure allows this, sometimes it's not always feasible. Not all of the components of the trial also may be monitored remotely. So the key to monitor successfully is to apply the appropriate level of remote and on-site monitoring based on risk. To do that, you need a good therapeutic understanding of the protocol. You need to [indiscernible] strong analytics and technology. So we've got all these elements at scale, but not every trial lends itself to remote monitoring.
Tycho Peterson: And then for a follow-up, as we think about the recovery, just wondering if you could give us some color on what type of work you think could come back sooner, Phase I versus II, III, oncology versus other therapeutic areas. And to what degree do you have to fight through sites that have been repurposed for COVID and beds that have been turned over? How much of a headwind could that be as we think about trial sites getting back up and running?
Ari Bousbib: Obviously, the -- look, we've got to -- over 100,000 sites around the world. So the situation is very different site by site, and you're right to point to therapeutic differences. Patient safety, obviously, in oncology is paramount because the patients are in the middle -- especially for in-site trials, where you can't just stop the treatment mid-course. So those are more likely to come back faster.  The activities that are hampered by these -- by the lack of access are site start-up, patient enrollment and, as we just discussed, monitoring. So it's not just the monitoring visits. It's also the early part, and as you know, we've got a big backlog of trial in start-up phase. So that has been the key hindrance for us.  Thank you. I'll ask everyone to if you could just -- given the timing constraint, I just want to limit your questions to one, unless it's an obvious follow-up. Thank you. Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: I guess maybe just to follow-up on that line of questioning, Ari. If you look at the update from the end of March with the number of sites that you guys framed as inaccessible, I think real time, you're saying 80%, and then obviously expecting 100% back online by 4Q. Maybe just spending a little bit more time understanding what's informing the cadence of the recovery. Obviously, you guys are a lot closer to it than us on this side of the world. And so just trying to get a better sense of really kind of how you're thinking through that type of recovery because I think, on the surface, obviously, it does seem to be fairly sharp but kind of V-shaped from here to the end of the year.
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, what we're talking about here is accessibility to on-site monitoring. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of the activities related to the trial are going to be enabled just because we can now access safely the site. You also have to have patients coming back. For example, we've seen in China that even when the site is open, not all patients are willing to come in. There's going to be a little bit of lingering concerns. So that's number one.  Number two, once the site is accessible to our CRAs, then they can go in and perform all the tasks that -- as I said in my introductory remarks, there are many tasks that we cannot do remotely, that the vast majority of the trials are going to require us to go back on-site and do the work that we would have done now in the second quarter or third quarter, checking documentations, making sure everything is in order and so on, physically, which is required. And our clients have already told us they will require that, when they accept remote monitoring visits, it's really to check on the patients and to do all the things we can do remotely. We still have to go on-site to do that work.  So this snapback does include a catch-up, if you will. In a given trial, that means, and I think our clients understand that, that the overall cost of the trial is going to go up because in addition to the remote monitoring visits, which we're doing now, we still have to do an on-site visit. It won't be the same on-site because a lot of the activities will have been done remotely, but there is an incremental piece of work that still needs to be done to ensure full compliance. So this is part of why it looks like a V-shaped somewhat.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird.
Eric Coldwell: A couple of topics. First off, in the early days of IQVIA, there was a lot of talk about fixed-price contracts, and I know that conversation died down over time. But I am curious, to the extent that you implemented fixed price contracting, what are the impacts on those contracts in the current environment? And secondarily or as an add-on, I'm curious if you have any early views on what change orders will look like over the next year or so, net negative, net neutral, net positive. Just your best guess on what happens to the total book of business compared to original expectations and what you might need to go back to clients for.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Eric. Okay, I think it's a good question. But look, when we said fixed price, I think it's a big -- it's a "fixed price", right? It's -- we don't have any contract where we take to one price for everything. No, it's parts of the contract that are based on a specific milestone being achieved in exchange for a specific value to be paid. Now obviously, all contracts have caveats, have outs, have circumstances. And look, our clients want the trial to be conducted. So they understand there are changes of scope that are being discussed. Fixed price is assuming the site visit can actually be performed. If it cannot be performed, then there's no way to fulfill the contractual obligation. So there has to be scope changes. I'm not -- I understand where the question comes from, but it's not a concern for us.  With respect to the book of business, in aggregate, look, the RFP flows, as I said earlier, are essentially flat to 2019, whether it's in dollars or in volume. And as you know, 2019 was a real, real record year. Our total R&DS pipeline is up mid-teens year-over-year, and our qualified pipeline for the next 12 months is the largest qualified pipeline we've ever had.  So the message I'm trying to send here, and frankly, while it might be intuitively easy to conclude that, we ourselves are stunned by the degree to which this is a very resilient industry, the pharma industry. And as I said before, it's not going away. If anything, I think people are right in the past to target pharma companies. I think these talks hopefully will recede and people -- as people understand how crucial drug discovery is.  And frankly, Eric, we are very confident going into 2021. We are -- this is why we've decided not to alter our operational capabilities. Even as many of our employees are essentially at home not very utilized, we decided we want to take care of them and continue because we've got strong expectations for 2021. It's also why we decided to engage as a leadership team. Now we've already started planning for 2021 because, again, we have good visibility on the book of business.
Operator: Your next call comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair.
John Kreger: Ari, you've mentioned a number of things you've been able to do to help mitigate the crisis, like remote monitoring and virtual visits and televisits. Just curious, in your view, as you move to the recovery phase, let's say, next year, do you think any of these things are going to sort of be structurally adopted by sites and clients? Or are you viewing them primarily as just temporary ways to mitigate the crisis.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean look, we -- long before the crisis had been advancing our virtual trial platform and -- which is being -- was being piloted last year and which -- for which we're having a lot of demand right now, many, many clients calling to ask whether we can transition, now it's hard to do that in the middle of a trial. But we are doing it to the degree we can, and we [indiscernible] accelerating development. So we think the trend will continue, and certainly -- but you will always need physical visits as well, okay? There's no way around it. A virtual trial means that all the pieces that can be done remotely will be done remotely. The patient still has to interact with their physician. And to the degree they could do it with telehealth, they'll do that. But there will be physical interactions as well. So the answer to your question is yes, people will accelerate the way we're thinking about this going forward. So yes.  I mean look it's true. I know what you're looking at. The unit price for a remote monitoring visit is less than a standard in-person site visit, given that there's less effort. There's no -- there's also less pass-through expense because there's no travel, for example, to the site. On the other hand, there is more time and more productivity. Again, as I said before, in-person site visits are still required, even in virtual trials, to meet the source data verification criteria. And until the standards, the regulatory standards change, we still need to verify the source data. And so yes, I mean the trial budget, actually, in the context of the crisis, as I said before, probably are going to go up, not down for now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Great. Ari, maybe just on the TAS business. It seems like that's proven pretty durable during these uncertain times. Can you just talk through recent trends, conversations with customers there and then just expectations kind of through this? And then again, on the other side, it feels like we have a pretty good handle on the R&D business. You're expecting that acceleration in the back end. Can you just talk about the pace of tasks during the year and then again on the other side of this as well?
Ari Bousbib: Patrick -- yes go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Patrick, do you mind just repeating again?
Ari Bousbib: Which area of the business? I couldn't hear the first part of your question.
Patrick Donnelly: The TAS business, sorry.
Ari Bousbib: The TAS business, okay. Yes, yes. Well, look, I mean, again, I just want to remind you, the TAS business roughly can be divided into 3 thirds, which is our legacy IMS info business and then you've got the technology business and then you've got the -- Technology and Analytics business and then you've got the Real-World business.  So with respect to information, the demand and our ability to supply our -- the information has been -- if anything, had a little uptick in the middle of the crisis. And once again, this is a business that's been historically flat. It is subscription-based, license-based and is more than 90% recurring. So that is entirely intact.  The part of the business that -- on the Real-World side that is based on patient-level data and so on is intact. The part of the business that's still prospective study is more similar -- more akin to the R&DS business and does require site visits. That has similar type of characteristics and has a little bit of headwind as a result of the crisis.  The Technology & Analytics business is basically intact. A lot of it is also licenses and recurring business. What is true, frankly, in this business is that the business that requires -- that's more marketing and sales, that requires face-to-face interactions, it's not a big business, frankly, but it is essentially virtually coming to a halt because you just can't have meetings with doctors. You can't have the conferences where -- or the compliance meetings and so on take place. And it's very hard to do it remotely. Maybe -- I think the last number I saw is 12% of that business has been moved to webinar-type format, but it's clearly not the same thing. And so that is very affected. But again, it's a very small part of the total. So yes, that is why the impact on TAS is less than on R&DS.  With respect to the exciting part of that business, which is the OCE platform, we've crossed the 100 customer mark with over 100 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. We're winning 2 out of 3 times against the competition. We are -- with a handful of exceptions, generally speaking, we're not seeing any slowdowns in the implementations. Actually, we've seen acceleration. We went live in the middle of the crisis for several deployments. They were very successful. I saw some very nice feedback from clients. The demand for remote detailing continues to rise with the OCE remote detailing, which is the most secure compliant platform in the space. We also launched in Q1 our compliance solutions in the commercial space. We also launched HCP engagement management, which already has 4 wins in Q1 and a strong pipeline.  So the technology platform business, we're not seeing any slowdown even on the business development front. Now they're all in the projects, analytics. We've got a little bit of consulting projects. All of that, as always, is delayed. And some of the business development activity is just being pushed to the right because the meetings can't take place and because the clients themselves are somewhat on hold with respect to new purchases of somewhat discretionary projects. So that obviously is a headwind to the rest of the year, third, fourth quarter and first quarter and next year. And again, these are smaller parts of the TAS business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper from SunTrust.
Alexander Draper: And listen, with regards to time, it'll be a quick one, I think, for Mike. On the delay of the share or the halting of the share repos, what are sort of the key factors that open that back up to you? Is it really -- if you hit your fourth quarter, everything is fully ramped back up then you go back? Do you want to see a couple of quarters? Just how should we think about going back to a more normalized capital deployment strategy? What are the factors that go into that decision?
Michael McDonnell: Sure, Sandy. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned, we did repurchase $321 million of our stock in the first quarter, and that all occurred largely before the crisis, including a chunk that we participated in a secondary offering by our sponsors.  I think we're going to be judicious with respect to capital deployment, obviously, manage our liquidity as a priority. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've not seen any disruption to -- or delays in collections at this point. We're continuing to manage that closely and carefully. We've got $1.4 billion on our $1.5 billion facility that's undrawn. So it puts us in a very good liquidity spot. But at the same time, obviously, with declines in EBITDA, leverage ratio has ticked up a bit. We're going to monitor that carefully. We prioritized keeping our employee base in a great place and not impacting base compensation in any way in anticipation of a big delivery task as things come back to normal.  And I think that share repurchases, we'll just continue to monitor as we get through the crisis with the prudent time to reenter the market. Obviously, we would love to be buying shares at the current levels, but at the same time, we're going to be very judicious with our capital allocation, whether it's M&A, share repurchase or CapEx. And I think we'll logically find the most prudent time to reenter when we get through the -- to the other side.
Operator: Our final question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So Ari, can you talk a little bit more about how the billing works in the current environment on the CRO side? If people can't get into the sites, is there a portion of what they do that's billable or a portion that's not billable? And then just to clarify, as part of this, when they actually have to go back in physically, the cost -- of that additional cost, you expect that to be largely borne by the clients versus being borne by the company. Is that correct?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks. Yes, the second part of your question, yes. Obviously, as I said before, there are, as a result of the crisis, changes of scope to the trial, and that includes conversation with the client as to how do we handle that incremental work that needs to be done. As to the first question, I wasn't sure I understood. The practical, the actual way that we do the billing, I don't know, Mike, do you have any insights on that?
Michael McDonnell: Yes. I mean I think -- bear in mind that revenue is driven by a percentage of completion, not so much the billing. But to the extent that we're able to complete tasks in the ordinary course and progress toward completion, we're able to bill that. In some cases, if we have milestones that we actually physically cannot hit because of factors that are outside of our control, in some cases, we have to have that conversation, are having those conversations with clients that allow us to bill and collect in cases where we're just stuck on not being able to hit a predetermined milestone, that didn't anticipate this kind of pandemic.  So we haven't seen disruption at this point. We'll continue to monitor. We have a great road map in China where sites are now reopening, and we've not seen really any disruption of note at all anywhere in the billing and collections front, including in the R&DS business.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you for taking the time to join us today, everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Jen and I will be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions that you may have. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-12 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 12th, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Pama. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Charles, Senior Vice President Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director Investor Relations. Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call where we will review how we closed 2019 and provide financial guidance for 2020. As you know, 2019 marks the final year of our three-year merger integration program. We've had 13 quarters since our merger closed. And I am pleased that we have consistently delivered revenue, EBITDA, and EPS at or above expectations. Let's review this most recent quarter in more detail. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.895 billion came in $38 million above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue growth was 7.7% on a reported basis and 8.5% on a constant currency basis. If we take a look back at our three-year growth performance, we grew revenue at 6.9% on average and we exited 2019 at 7.7% or 8.5% on a constant currency basis. Recall at the time of the merger, we told you that total company revenue growth would be 100 to 200 basis points higher exiting the third year of our merger integration. And as you know this was achieved during the third year of our merger integration. Full year 2019 revenue of $11.088 billion grew 8% at constant currency and almost 6% on an organic constant currency basis. That represents an organic revenue growth acceleration of well over 200 basis points compared to 2018. We see this strong topline growth rate continuing into 2020 and Mike will provide more details later. Back to the quarter, from a segment perspective, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue grew 9% at constant currency. As expected, Technology & Analytics Solutions growth moderated slightly sequentially. This was the result of our unusually strong Q3 organic performance as well as a lower contribution from M&A. But despite this, Technology & Analytics Solutions organic growth came in at over 7% -- 7.4% to be precise which is well above the historic trend from the IMS days which some of you will recall was more in the 4% range. So, in this segment, significant acceleration. R&D solutions revenue grew 8.1% at constant currency. Now, we told you last quarter that R&DS organic services growth would be higher in the fourth quarter. And in fact, adjusting for the impact of pass-throughs of approximately 400 basis points and an M&A contribution of approximately 200 basis points, organic services growth on a constant currency basis accelerated to exactly 10%, also representing a significant acceleration versus the pre-merger services organic growth rate, which was just under 5%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions continues to demonstrate that it has turned a corner, growing 8.3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Now this is undoubtedly very strong performance, but I would remind you, it was also an easy comparison against fourth quarter last year. We expect CSMS to maintain very modest growth going forward. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $642 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins that continued to expand in the quarter. As you know, we've been making investments in technology talent and go-to-market resources. We've also been very active in deploying all of our tech wins, developing the clinical and commercial technology offerings, and acquiring tech companies all of which have a dilutive impact on our margins. So in this context, we are very pleased with our results. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.74 was at the high end of our guidance range and grew 16%. These strong financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements and milestones. I'd like to take you through some of our 2019 operational achievements. 2019 was a pivotal year for our technology business. OCE gained significant traction earning deserved credibility in the market. We won 50 new OCE deals in 2019 compared to 30 in 2018, which was the first full year post launch. We now have almost 60,000 contracted seats to deploy. We have four top 15 pharma clients, who have made the decision to adopt our superior platform. Our deployment with Roche is complete for several countries in Asia. With that successful delivery, we are working to accelerate the rollout globally to enable Roche's worldwide digital strategy. The Novo Nordisk deployment is well underway and feedback has been very positive. Additionally, we are excited to start our first large U.S. deployment as you've seen in one AstraZeneca U.S. business for OCE. During 2019, we also ramped our investment in the clinical technology space, and I want to highlight today our progress in Virtual Trials. You will recall that our Virtual Trial technology Study Hub is a scalable SaaS platform built on Salesforce's Health Cloud. We're having success in the market with this transformative technology and delivery model. We're now executing on several studies on a global basis in all key geographies. Studies span multiple therapeutic areas, including CNS, oncology, and digital therapeutics to name a few. And the study execution can take the form of either a full Virtual Trial or a combination of both traditional and Virtual Trial. We have a strong pipeline in Virtual Trials and have established ourselves as a premier provider in this space going into 2020. In real-world, we continue to build our leading position in the real-world market. We were selected as a preferred provider by Roche Pharma Company with over 20 real-world engagements already over the next five years. We also helped the top 10 pharma company obtained, an FDA-approved license extension for an oncology product using a real-world comparator arm. And lastly, we continue to make enhancements to E360 Genomics our patented technology platforms, which will advance, research in the real-world space through the use of non-identified genomic data linked to rich patient analytics. The real-world team continues to invest in our rich clinical data assets, which has now grown to 800 million non-identified patients globally. Moving to R&D. For the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.46 on both a services basis and including pass-throughs. For the full year, our services book-to-bill was 1.34. And including pass-throughs, the book-to-bill was 1.33. Our backlog at the end of the year was a record $19 billion. Our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased by a further $100 million to $5.2 billion. In 2019, we won business with well over 250 new clients in the clinical space during the year. Importantly, we captured two preferred provider agreements with top 15 pharma clients that had been locked out previously. We are clearly seeing more and winning more trials as sponsors come to realize the benefits of our highly differentiated capabilities. In fact our CORE-powered Smart trial offering continues to drive new business wins. During the quarter, we were awarded over $900 million of CORE-powered Smart trial business excluding pass-throughs. Today, 13 of the top 20 pharma companies are using our CORE-powered approach to improve trial design to speed up site identification and to increase patient recruitment. As we speak, we have over 800 Smart trials in operation, enrolling more than 120,000 patients. Finally, just like to say a few words about the business environment. R&D activity is at an all-time high with total number of molecules in clinical development continues to grow with the late-stage pipeline growing 11% in 2019. On average over the last three years, the FDA has approved 51 new drugs. Importantly, outsourcing penetration of addressable clinical spend has grown to almost 50% as pharma companies turn to CROs for expertise in running increasingly complex trials and recruiting increasingly hard to find patients. Venture Capital funding of life sciences companies remains robust. The National Venture Capital Association reported a record number of deals in 2019 with dollars invested moderating only slightly over a record set in 2018. All of these supports a very solid backdrop for the industry as we go into 2020. Once again, another very strong quarter and a very, very strong year across all our businesses. Mike will now review the financials in more detail.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari. Good morning, everyone. As you have seen it was a very solid quarter running out a very strong year. Let's turn first to revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,895 million grew 8.5% at constant currency and 7.7% reported. Revenue for the full year was $11,088 million and grew 8% at constant currency and 6.5% reported. Technology & Analytics Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,214 million grew 9% at constant currency and 7.7% reported. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the year was $4,486 million and grew 10.7% at constant currency and 8.4% reported. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,471 million grew 8.1% at constant currency and 7.5% reported. Full year R&D solutions revenue of $5,788 million grew 6.9% at constant currency and 5.9% reported. Fourth quarter, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $210 million grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis and 8.8% reported. CSMS revenue for the year was $814 million, up 1.6% at constant currency and 0.5% on a reported basis. Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $642 million for the fourth quarter and $2,400 million for the full year of 2019. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $16 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.09. Full year GAAP net income was $191 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.96. Adjusted net income was $343 million for the fourth quarter and $1,276 million for the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year to $1.74. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.39 grew 15.1%. Let's turn now to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at December 31, 2019 was $19 billion. And the amount of backlog that we expect to convert to revenue over the next 12 months increased by approximately $100 million to $5.2 billion. As Ari mentioned, we are well-positioned for further acceleration in R&DS revenue growth in 2020. Let's now review the balance sheet. At December 31st, cash and cash equivalents totaled $837 million and debt was $11,645 million, resulting in net debt of $10,808 million. Our net leverage ratio was 4.5 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $583 million in the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the year. CapEx for the full year was $582 million, of which $137 million was spent in the fourth quarter. As expected, we had a large ramp in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $446 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of $835 million. We repurchased $255 million of our stock during the fourth quarter totaling $945 million for the year. Now, let's turn to 2020 guidance. Our full year 2020 revenue guidance is $11,775 million to $12 million. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,565 million and $2,620 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $7.15 and $7.35. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at February 7, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the year. You should note that since the beginning of the year, when we originally set our plans for the year, foreign currency rates have moved against us and resulting -- and have resulted in a headwind to our 2020 revenue plan of about $80 million. So, absent these movements, full year 2020 revenue guidance would have been about $80 million higher. In addition, our financial guidance includes our best assessment of potential coronavirus impacts and our guidance assumes -- which our guidance assumes will primarily affect our R&D Solutions segment. You can appreciate that this is evolving in real-time, but we can already see disruptions to our sites which are mostly hospitals in China. We are currently assuming and hoping for a short-term resolution to this outbreak and have therefore assumed an impact to first quarter revenue of $25 million with heavy drop-through and have carried these impacts to our full year guidance. Before turning to our first quarter guidance, a few additional points about the full year, regarding our segments for 2020. We currently expect Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to be between $4,775 million and $4,860 million, representing reported growth of 6.4% to 8.3% or 7.2% to 9.1% on a constant currency basis. This guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of M&A contribution, which is considerably lower than what it has been over the last three years. R&D solutions revenue is expected to be between $6,185 million and $6,325 million, representing reported growth of 6.9% to 9.3% or 7.2% to 9.6% on a constant currency basis. Note this growth rate assumes a 200 basis point headwind from pass-throughs, so R&D Solutions' constant currency services growth is expected to be 9.2% to 11.6%. This guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of M&A contribution. We expect R&D solutions revenue growth to be lumpy quarter-over-quarter. You should not expect the growth rate to be linear. Specifically, as it relates to the first quarter of 2020, I would encourage you to look at our past performance. You will see it is not unusual for growth rates in R&D Solutions to step down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Additionally this year, we have incorporated the impact of the coronavirus, which I just discussed. CSMS revenue is expected to be about $815 million, representing reported growth of about 0.1% for 2020 or approximately 0.7% at constant FX rates. While we look at the acceleration of the business overall, we know many of you are focused on the revenue acceleration for R&D Solutions, so I'd like to take a minute to highlight our progression there. As you know, the impact to growth from pass-throughs has been lumpy, but since the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018, we have continued to see pass-throughs grow at a slower rate than service revenue. This is due to the number of projects we have in the start-up phase, where less pass-through is generated. Therefore, we believe it is best to look at R&D solutions services growth adjusted for the impact of pass-throughs. On that basis, constant currency R&D Solutions services growth was 5.4% in 2017, which was the first full year after the merger. For 2020, the first full year after our merger integration period, the midpoint of our R&D solutions constant currency services growth guidance is 10.4%. So, you can see we have nearly doubled our growth rate which represents a dramatic acceleration. Let me now give you some color on the first quarter of 2020. Assuming FX rates at February 7 remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2,790 million and $2,840 million, adjusted EBITDA to be between $595 million and $610 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.59 and $1.65. And as I mentioned earlier, we have assumed a disproportionate impact of the coronavirus in the first quarter and this is reflected in our guidance. First quarter guidance assumes foreign currency rates at February 7, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, foreign currency rates have moved against us since the beginning of the year, which has resulted in a headwind to our first quarter revenue plan of about $20 million. And so absent these movements, first quarter revenue guidance would have been about $20 million higher. And so in summary, fourth quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings were at or above our financial targets. Full year 2019 organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated over 200 basis points compared to 2018. Adjusted diluted EPS continues to compound in the mid-teens with 15.1% growth in 2019. We won 50 new OCE deals in 2019. R&D Solutions backlog stands at $19 billion with $5.2 billion expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. CSMS successfully stabilized in 2019. We deployed almost $1 billion to share repurchase and we are planning for a very strong 2020, demonstrating strong continued operating momentum and growth acceleration. And with that let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much and good morning. I have two questions. The first is in Technology & Analytics. A tough one to ask. I'm not sure how to best go about this but there's been obviously a lot of investment, a lot of new wins. You've got a lot of onboarding coming with the top pharmas that you've highlighted here. I'm curious if you have a sense on when based on the current pipeline and your current wins, when the actual revenue and performance of clients that have been onboarded might be able to offset the incremental investments that you're making during the onboarding phase? In other words, do you see a point? Is it 2021 or 2022, where you have more momentum with onboarded clients that you can absorb future onboarding and maintain or grow the EBITDA in the segment?
Andrew Markwick: Hi, Eric, this is Andrew. I think, I mean if we go back to our Analyst Day in June we laid out a new plan for the next three years through the 2020, 2022 time frame. We clearly said that, we expect EBITDA to grow slower than it has been in the past. We're committed to margin expansion and we're looking for margin expansion in the business but the deployments we're putting out currently are going to pressure that and the investments we're seeing in technology. We're going to see some of that revenue come through now. But obviously, we've got large global deployments for the likes of Roche and we're planning on being active with our go-to-market as well. Hopefully, as we go forward, this will bring natural margin accretion because the revenue that we're layering into the base is higher margin, but we're not assuming that's going to take place during the next three years, so we've asked everyone to underwrite the midterm guidance. But if you do the math on the EBITDA growth, get to an average to about 20, 30 basis points, which assumes kind of continued investment in deployment of the technology wins.
Ari Bousbib: Eric, good morning. If your question is as always on the margin, you're trying to understand when the benefit of higher-margin seats license revenue offsets the investments. And obviously, we are hoping that we're going to continue to accelerate our selling momentum in this business. So it's hard to just isolate the EBITDA contribution of that line of business, because we continue to invest and deploy new seats. And hopefully we'll continue to grow our market share and expand. When the business in isolation is more accretive to margins, it will be some time in the next three-year period. But in aggregate as Andrew reminded us, we expect to continue to grow our EBITDA faster than our top line and over the period and have margin accretion for the company as a whole. You had a second question?
Eric Coldwell: Yes. Yes. It's sort of a follow-on on that and it's -- I absolutely agree we'd rather see the business wins than you making the investments now for the future. So thank you for that. The follow-on and I apologize if I missed it we're toggling a couple of reports. But did you mention anything about the pipeline either in OCE or tech more broadly? You had the 80-plus wins that you've cited here on this call since rolling out OCE. I'm curious what your pipeline might be. And do you have a line of sight over the next year on additional top 15 pharmas? What does that pipeline look like based on those clients' renewal cycles and who may be coming to market?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean look, it's -- we are in dialogue. We have been in dialogue since we launched the product with essentially all large pharma and really anyone who's contemplating either a renewal or a switch or an upgrade to their CRM platform. So, we have an active pipeline and some are more likely than others, but it's hard for me to give you precise numbers in isolation of that client. In addition, as you know, we have all the add-ons. We have ePromo, the analytics, the MDM products that can be stitched together with OCE. And we are very, very active in conversations with -- on the clinical technology side, I mentioned in my remarks Virtual Trials that I wanted to highlight. But certainly, the other modules of our clinical technology suites, we are also in active discussions with safety and regulatory modules and others on content management. So, there is a very large pipeline and we have a lot of conversations. It's going to continue to ramp up. This is why we feel comfortable with the guidance on the Technology & Analytics segment. That represents a significant acceleration versus our history. I think you are a bit familiar with the history at IMS and our "best-in-class" organic growth rate was more in the 4% range. And bear in mind that our Info business, which is a significant portion, let's say, about a third or 30% or so of our Tech & Analytics Solutions segment grows at zero percent. So, when you do the math, you will realize that the growth on the Technology piece and the Analytics piece is significant.
Eric Coldwell: Yes. That’s great. Thank you so much for the answers, and congrats on the strong outlook.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks so much. I guess just wanted to talk a little bit about the cadence for 2020. I know you guys laid out a lot of detail to help us think through that. But if I just look at the sequential total enterprise-level revenue step-down from last year and then what you're indicating for this year, it does seem like obviously an easier comp for 1Q year-over-year adjusting for corona. Is there anything else you guys are thinking about as far as what's at play as far as why the revenue in 1Q might look to be a bit of a deceleration again off of an easy comp year-over-year? And then, what's the line of sight obviously to get to the full year number that you guys sound very confident in achieving next year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I'm not sure what the question is. If the question is on Q1, why is Q1, again Q1 unfortunately we just assumed that the quarter will -- we see what's happening in China as a result of coronavirus. I don't want to overstate it because it's -- China represents a very tiny piece of our overall business. Without disclosing the number of sites we have well over 100,000 sites worldwide. And in the particular region in China where this is happening it's less than 100 sites. I think in China, we might have somewhere around a couple of thousand sites. But people -- patients are simply not going. The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China, because that's kind of the more dangerous spot right now. And then obviously CRAs will not send them. So, there's a little bit of a pause in business environment, if you will as a result of this and we've quantified that to be $25 million of impact in the first quarter assuming resolution by then hopefully. And that obviously -- we're still paying bigger so the costs are there, and so, most of that $25 million is dropping through profits as well. And so that kind of causes a little depression in the first quarter. And we've carried that to -- that's the main explanation. Yes.
Robert Jones: No. I think that makes a ton of sense sorry. I guess I maybe asked another way. I guess ex-ing out the impact from corona, is there anything we should be contemplating as far as the cadence of 2020 versus the normal cadence of revenue growth that we've seen the last year.
Ari Bousbib: No. I mean look generally, if you look at every year, so for instance, we've had IQVIA in operation, which is a little over three years. Generally the first quarter represents a little less proportion of the revenue than the other quarters, right? I mean it's like a couple of percentage points lower in Q1 than Q4 for example. If you look -- if you take a look at 2019, Q1 was 24% of our EBITDA for the full year and Q4 was 27%. And on a revenue basis, Q1 of 2019 was 24% of our revenue and Q4 was 26%. So generally, there's 2 to 3 points difference because of the proportion that they represent. So, it's generally the case. And then furthermore, if you look at actual numbers FX is significant. And I think relative to prior year, when you compare year-over-year the impact of FX year-over-year is very significant -- is more significant in the first quarter. You wanted to add something Andrew?
Andrew Markwick: No. Obviously FX is a headwind to year-over-year growth for the full year. We're not obviously going to see that in the first quarter. We might call out that since the beginning of the year FX has moved against us by about $20 million. So our guidance would have been $20 million higher, if we hadn't had the strengthening of the dollar over the last few weeks. The growth rate you're reporting on -- calculating on a reported basis obviously on a constant dollar basis would probably be about 90 to 100 basis points higher for that year-over-year FX headwind as well.
Ari Bousbib: In the first quarter.
Andrew Markwick: In the first quarter. Yes.
Robert Jones: Got it.
Operator: Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I wonder -- focused on the upside in the fourth quarter. So if you look at revenue it came in above the guidance you had laid out for the fourth quarter pretty comfortably. I guess versus your plan where was the upside? At least when I first saw the number, I assumed it was pass-throughs, but it was actually the opposite. Obviously that was a headwind. And then on the EBITDA line, I think one nitpick would be, you didn't see any drop-downs. So just wondering if you could comment on whether there was some reinvestment back in the business as well?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well thank you Jack. Thank you for the question. Yes, the upside versus guidance on the revenue came entirely from the underlying operational performance of the businesses and not from pass-through. As you said pass-through was a headwind. The majority of the beat versus our guidance, the vast majority was in the technology segment. We just talked about this during my remarks and answers to Eric's question. We're starting to see revenue ramp on the technology business -- Technology & Analytics Solutions segment. And the flip side is, mitigating the drop-through of EBITDA which is very strong by the way on the technology side, very strong EBITDA drop-through. But mitigating that are the continuing investments in deployment. So when we finish deployment for our top 10 clients in Asia those revenues come in at a very high margin because again they are SaaS licenses. But at the same time, we're deploying in other parts of the world and so that implementation is essentially a no-margin business. So that offsets that and offsets our continuing investments as you pointed out. Nevertheless I just want to point out that we had generated margin accretion -- margin expansion in the quarter.
Jack Meehan: Yes. That's all fair. And Mike I was curious as you went about assessing the impact from coronavirus and I know it's to the best of your ability at this point. But just comment is this predominantly the $25 million on the R&D segment? Is there any impact potentially on the tech side?
Michael McDonnell: Yes. The majority of it is on the R&D side. I'd say it's virtually 100% on the R&DS side where we would see the impact. The rest of the business, we don't see any material impacts.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean just to add obviously there's a -- again, it's just a physical constraint. The rest of the business is less -- does not require actual physical movement of people on the Technology & Analytics Solutions side. So as Mike said, I think we can say 99% is on the R&D side.
Jack Meehan: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Continuing on next...
Ari Bousbib: I'm sorry. Just to comment on this a little bit. We obviously have contingencies and we're working on mitigating all of these issues. So I don't want to -- it is obviously an evolving situation but we currently expect that this will be resolved. And we are also internally working on mitigation plans we're reorienting certain sites opening up new sites outside of China et cetera. So it's not like we're just sitting and waiting for these sites to be open blindly. So I just want to make sure you understand we're a large company and we can absorb the issues within our contingency for the year. We will revisit as appropriate if things change.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Now our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question on -- obviously the book-to-bill in the quarter was very impressive and you spoke into some of the lumpiness and outlook. Is there anything to think about in terms of like the trial conversions and sort of the length or delays in starts that we should also take into account?
Andrew Markwick: Sorry, Elizabeth can you say that again? I'm not sure we followed. We couldn't hear the beginning of your question.
Elizabeth Anderson: Sorry, about that. Can you -- hopefully you can hear me better now. So obviously you guys put up a very impressive book-to-bill and it comes on the back of several other really nice book-to-bills. So I know that you spoke about some of the impact of the trial lumpiness in the quarter, but I wanted to know if there was anything you guys had to comment about, sort of, trial conversions or increased complexity or delayed start times or anything on sort of like a more broader level that you're seeing that would also potentially play into some of the sort of intra-quarter movement in your guidance.
Andrew Markwick: No. I think I mean when you look at the first quarter I think if you look at history we're trying pretty much along the lines of what we've seen historically. There's nothing unusual, no delays. I think if anything we're moving forward in our backlog. Next 12 months' revenue is nice and healthy and shows continued increases every quarter at this stage and its business as usual for us everywhere else.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Very, very strong very strong bookings continuing across the board. We've can see that before that we believe we're gaining market share and I think it's pretty obvious if you look at the size of our revenue and the level of the -- I think we've had seven quarters in a row where we've had book-to-bill ratios above 1.2. Is that correct?
Andrew Markwick: Yes. Over the last couple of years.
Ari Bousbib: And we've had very, very strong bookings I mean for the year 1.33 or 1.34 if you look at it on services basis. And across the board we have a very, very strong proportion very, very strong the vast majority being full clinical work. And because we are in start-up phase for all of those very strong bookings that we generated last year remember in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 we had book-to-bill ratios of 1.7. And those were -- lots of them were full clinical work and they are in start-up phase. And during that start-up phase they are -- there is no pass-throughs obviously right? So that's what's causing the headwinds from pass-throughs -- the higher headwind from pass-throughs in the fourth quarter. Now the good news is full clinical are the nice sweet spots of the CRO business where you want to be and they have higher margins. And we expect strong margin drop-throughs in the next couple of years as we continue to deploy those -- or perform those clinical trials.
Elizabeth Anderson: Okay. That's very helpful. And obviously with your book-to-bill and the continued revenue growth you guys are putting up some -- what I assume are some nice share gains versus peers. Is there anything you'd like to call out either qualitatively or not about, sort of, reasons that people -- sponsors are choosing you any particular like products offerings or other things?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I think we've mentioned in the past that our capabilities are unique what we call the CORE-powered SMART trials using data analytics and technology to, sort of, model out the trial early on, healthy trial design, optimize protocols, accelerate site identification to optimize the trial strategy and of course all of that supporting a faster and more precise patient recruitment, which is demonstrated now by our performance on those trials. When we started after the merger I think we were very, very pleased to see quarterly awards not talking about bookings, but awards of SMART trials being the $200 million $300 million a quarter. And I mentioned in my introductory remarks that this past quarter we had over $900 million of award and that service is only in terms of the -- of CORE-powered SMART trials. It's becoming the way we do business. We are applying CORE-powered SMART trial to the vast majority of what we bid on today with a higher win rate as a result of those capabilities. Thank you. 
Elizabeth Anderson: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. 
Operator: Okay. Continuing on our next question comes from line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed, sir.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Ari, given all the wins that you've had in OCE, can you talk a little bit about just have you seen a competitive response from a major competitor over there? Is there anything that they're doing in terms of pricing? Also there's some comments that I've heard from speculation that you -- that in order to win some of the business you could be subsidizing the OCE with the fact that you have such a big base of info services. Is the pricing that you're going out to the market with competitive in the market? Are you winning based on capabilities? Or is there some of that subsidy going on? Thank you. 
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Shlomo. And we -- I know there's a lot of noise. And as you know there is an entrenched dominant competitor in this space that has had essentially easy for many years essentially for a decade. And so for sure we are coming from behind and that today has done a fantastic job and we admire their performance. But we believe that our product is superior in terms of functionality. I remind you that OCE is based on the different Salesforce platform than the competitor product was. The competitor product was built on the Salesforce platform of 10 years ago. Since then, it's a totally different platform with a lot more functionality that is being built into the platform and from which we have benefited. So the added functionality is really what helps us win. There are AI/ML modules built into this OCE platform that do not exist at the competitors. In order to match those, they have to build custom-made modules. Now ours are standard and built from the start, that's the fundamental difference. That's the fundamental difference and this is why we are able to win. Trust me on a global deployment in over 100 countries as we're doing for Roche for such an important tool for Roche, a few dollars more or less I'm not going to make them switch. This is one of the most sophisticated pharma companies around. They will pay a higher price for better functionality. In the grand scheme of things, it does not represent a huge line item in Roche's P&L. Okay? So we are not an underlying in stress. We are not pricing below. We actually in some cases have priced at a premium.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. And has there been a competitive response that you want to point out? Or what does it look like to you?
Ari Bousbib: Look I usually refrain from commenting on what competitors are doing. I mean all I know is the competitor bought a company that kind of -- that works with, I think, which is was called cross [Indiscernible] -- 
Andrew Markwick: Yes.
Ari Bousbib: Something like that, that has a little bit of data or that works with data. I'm not quite sure what it is to be frank. But clearly, it's an event that provide them capabilities additional. And then there are other reactions that I'd rather not comment on -- but I -- we're just focused on executing on our strategy.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger: Hi. Thank you. Ari another technology question for you. Could you give us an update on the OCT suite of products? Curious if you could give us a sense about timing and whether or not you think that could offer a similar opportunity as the success you're seeing now with OCE? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So today, look we have a few modules that are already available and that are being sold. We have specific technologies like the site portal, the investigated payments and e-consent that are out in the market and are quite successful. There are also patient photos. Virtual Trials that I discussed is really what we've been pushing. And by the way in the context -- I don't want to bring it up again. In context of what's going on in China with Virtual Trial, the technology actually shows that that's the way of the future. Risk-based monitoring and mobile CRA will go live in the first quarter of 2020. And we've got additional products like CTMS which will be released in Q4, so -- which again with a full sweep. As we said the full suite would be essentially available by the end of the year, so we're releasing modules as we go.
John Kreger: Very helpful. Thanks. And Mike a question for you. I think you talked about backlog increasing 11% last year compared to where ended in 2018. Is there anything you want to call out in terms of mix shifts within that backlog that could perhaps be a tailwind or headwinds for margins over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Andrew Markwick: Hey, John, it's Andrew. I think I mean we have a very large backlog, which we're very pleased with. And we see continued growth in next 12 months revenue from backlog. I think it's becoming increasingly diverse in terms of client mix, but really is more concentrated towards large pharma at this stage. We've obviously had a lot of success with the emerging biopharma clients which is a segment that we've really wanted to focus on post merger and we've seen a lot of success there. Out of the gate with our CORE-powered solution, I think that's where really show those kinds that are hungry for data tech analytics they have the right kind of products that are focused on that kind of approach. As our CORE-powered business has grown and Ari mentioned earlier, we were kind of a $2 million account post merger and we're running at close of $900 million a quarter, large pharma really coming to the table and looking at that offering. So I think being to assess with all client segments, it's still mainly large pharma is the main mix within our revenue base in that.
John Kreger: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Crédit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. You've historically been very diligent on the cost management front. I understand that you've completed the initial integration post-merger. But, what does your guidance assume in terms of continued incremental cost savings here on, in 2020 or even beyond? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Erin thanks for the question. We indeed as you pointed out actually exceeded our plans, for the $200 million synergy costs take-outs, that we have announced at the time of the merger. And we achieved that sometime earlier in 2019. But we also announced at our investor conference in June that we were launching a new $200 million cost-elimination initiatives for -- which we named V22 for the next 3-year period: 2020, 2021, 2022, and we are doing this in order to take advantage of the new larger scale of our business. We're now at a phase of an inflection point frankly, where we see growth accelerating. And we have to make sure when this happens in a business that, we don't let costs creep up ahead of revenue or even at the same time or in line with revenue. At the same time, we got to support that growth. So it's a more complex on an equation to manage. And therefore, it's important that we have a specific program. And we do have a program office, with a full-time team, that's dedicated to running those initiatives, across the company. Those run the gamut from continued initiatives on procurement, on infrastructure optimization, whether it's real estate, IT systems. And of course the more complex aspects of automation, using bots and AI/ML tools within our own operations. Offshoring which continue scaling up our Philippines, our India, and our other offshore centers in Eastern Europe, in South America, to continue supporting the growth from those centers. And all of those, in combination, we expect to generate exiting 2022, $200 million of cost savings, which we believe is necessary to more than offset the headwind to margins, that we would otherwise have, if we did nothing else. And we believe that, that is going to be ramping usually, a smaller portion in the first year. Maybe I'm going to say 20% or so of that $200 million will come in 2020, and then, perhaps another 30% or so in 20'21, and then, the balance the last 50%, during 2022. So that's the best estimate we have here, on how this is going to ramp up. Thank you very much, Erin.
Erin Wright: Okay that's perfect. And then, on Virtual Trials, do you think that you're leading the market now in Virtual Trial concepts? And you mentioned a strong pipeline there do you think that your win rates are disproportionately higher in -- with Virtual Trials? And how many Virtual Trials are you actually working on now? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. It's in the double-digits, right? So I think it's -- what's that number? Do we have the number?
Andrew Markwick: I don't think we want to disclose it yet.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. We're not going to disclose it yet; you know more than 10, less than 20, okay? And it's all with large pharma.
Erin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you for asking the questions, Erin. I think we're approaching the top of the hour now. So I think we'll end the call there. And thank you everyone for taking the time for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again, on our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Jen and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you may have for the rest of the day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. And ask that, you please disconnect your lines. Thank you once again.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 30th, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Charles, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our website. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our first [ph] quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that the first [ph] quarter is a continuation of the solid momentum we've had since the beginning of the year. Once again revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings all came in at the high end or above our guidance ranges even after the currency impact. Third quarter revenue of $2.769 billion came in $14 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and $34 million above the midpoint of our guidance range when you adjust for the foreign currency impact. Revenue growth was 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Actually, when you adjust for acquisitions and pass-throughs for the total company, organic constant currency revenue growth is already in the 7% range. From a second segment perspective, Technology Analytics Solutions revenue grew 10% at constant currency. During the quarter, we marked the anniversary of several tech businesses we had acquired in 2018 and therefore, the contribution to growth from M&A was about 200 basis points which is half of what it was last quarters. The acceleration of the TAS organic constant currency revenue growth which came in at almost 8% this quarter was driven by the timing of our real-world client engagement deliverables as well as accelerated technology deployments. R&D solutions revenue grew 6.8% at constant currency. This growth rate included an impact from pass-throughs of approximately 200 basis points which was roughly offset by the contribution from M&A. Contract sales and medical solutions continues to demonstrate that it has turned a corner growing about 5% on a constant currency basis. This is a result of our strategy to integrate the business with our commercial operations. We expect the CSMS business to deliver the flat year-over-year growth we projected for the year and to sustain modest growth in 2020 maybe in the low single-digits. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $593 million was towards the high end of our guidance range. As I mentioned, our technology deployments are driving our topline acceleration, but we also incur upfront costs with these deployments which are included in our margins. So, in this context, our adjusted EBITDA performance in the quarter was quite strong. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 12.7%. The $0.04 beat versus the midpoint of our guidance was driven by $0.02 of strong organic operational performance and $0.02 of below the line efficiency. Let me give you some color on the businesses and our progress. In technology, I am pleased to report that we now have over 70 OCE wins since launch. In the third quarter alone, we signed 20 new OCE deals including a win with the top 15 pharma clients to deploy OCE sales and marketing in the U.S. and another win with a top 15 pharma client to deploy OCE in Asia. Both of these deals with large pharmas have the potential for geographic as well as therapeutic area expansion. Of the 20 new wins in the quarter, 15 were head-to-head competitions against the leading dominant incumbent in the CRM space, and the two top 15 pharma wins were outright displacements. Turning to real world. We've spoken to you before about our success in supporting single-arm studies using real-world evidence. Our clients are increasingly looking to us for innovation in this space. In fact in just the last 12 months, the number of projects we are working on that use an external comparator arm has quadrupled. For example, we had a recent win with a top 10 pharma client in Europe to conduct a hematology/oncology external comparator project. Critical to the success of the project was a QGS proprietary oncology network infrastructure, which was utilized to access a very difficult to find comparator patient population. Our global infrastructure allows us to provide our clients a faster and more predictable path to deep clinical insights on niche patient populations and enables this kind of novel research. During the quarter, the real-world team was also awarded a preferred provider partnership with a top 10 pharma company for our ECOA or electronic clinical outcome assessment technology platform. Our newly launched cloud-based technology platform uses a simple interface to collect direct from patients critical data. This allows sponsors to better understand and improve the patient experience, resulting in reduced timelines, improved transparency and real-time insights about patients. Moving to R&D. The team continued their strong momentum with another quarter of excellent bookings. For the quarter, on a contracted basis and excluding pass-throughs, our book-to-bill was 1.31 and including pass-throughs the R&D as book-to-bill was 1.24. We are reporting this metric for transparency. But as we've said many times before we think it is much less meaningful than services bookings as the estimates and timing of pass-throughs can vary greatly quarter-to-quarter. For the last 12 months ended September 30, the contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.40, excluding reimbursed expenses and 1.36 including reimbursed expenses. RMBS backlog of $18.3 billion grew over 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018. And importantly, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased by a further $200 million to $5.1 billion, growing 10.6% year-over-year or 13.3% if you exclude pass-throughs. This important forward indicator metric supports our expectations of continued RMBS revenue growth acceleration into 2020. Demand for our core power capabilities continues to be strong. We now have 13 large pharma clients using our differentiated solution. Further, during the quarter we were very excited to secure a new preferred provider agreement with a top 10 pharma client. This was previously a locked out account, and our achievement resulted in the displacement of two competitors, let's call them particularly prominent competitors. The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Our pipeline of RMBS opportunities whether you look at dollars, for a number of RFPs continues to be at the same strong pace as 2018, and that was a record year for us. Our pipeline is growing high teens year-to-date compared with last year. The EVP segment which I know is often a subject of questions remains very healthy. As you know, 2018 was a blockbuster year in terms of funding, but year-to-date 2019 funding is tracking similar to 2017, which was also a very strong year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand growing 8% since the end of last year and interestingly 11% in oncology. Once again, another strong quarter across all of our businesses. And I'm going to now turn it to Mike, who will review the financials in more detail.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you Ari and good morning everyone. As you've seen, we've had a more solid quarter. Let's turn first to revenue. Third quarter revenue of $2.769 billion grew 6.7% reported and 7.9% at constant currency. Revenue for the first nine months of the year was $8.193 billion and grew 6.1% reported and 7.9% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1.095 billion grew 8% reported and 10% at constant currency. Tech & Analytics Solutions year-to-date revenue of $3.272 billion grew 8.7% reported and 11.4% at constant currency. R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1.466 billion grew 6.1% at actual FX rates and 6.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date R&D Solutions revenue of $4.317 billion grew 5.4% at actual FX rates and 6.5% at constant currency. Third quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $208 million grew 5.1% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $604 million declined 2.1% at actual FX rates and 0.5% at constant currency. Let's turn now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $593 million for the third quarter and $1.758 billion for the first nine months of 2019. Third quarter GAAP net income was $57 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $175 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.87. Adjusted net income was $318 million for the third quarter and $933 million year-to-date. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12.7% year-over-year to $1.60. Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.65 grew 14.8%. Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at September 30, 2019 was $18.3 billion and the amount of backlog that we expect to convert to revenue over the next 12 months grew by about $200 million to $5.1 billion. As Ari mentioned, we are well positioned for further acceleration in RMBS revenue growth in 2020. Let's now review the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $863 million and debt was $11.542 billion which resulted in net debt of $10.679 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.6 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $330 million in the third quarter, CapEx was $149 million and free cash flow was $181 million. We repurchased $313 million of our stock during the third quarter, including $157 million from certain of our remaining private equity sponsors. Our private equity ownership now represents approximately 5% of our shares outstanding. Before we turn to guidance, a few words on FX. As Ari mentioned earlier, the Q3 revenue number we just reported includes an impact from FX of about $20 million versus the last time we reported. Our full year revenue guidance previously included a 110 basis point impact from FX. This has now increased to 160 basis points. As a result of our strong year-to-date organic performance, we are reaffirming our constant currency full year revenue growth guidance at the midpoint and tightening our range. As you know, we raised our full year guidance last quarter, largely to reflect our stronger organic performance. There is no change here and we still see good momentum on the top line. On a constant currency basis, we now expect revenue to grow 7.3% to 7.7%. On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected to be 5.6% to 6.1%, which reflects the additional 50 basis point impact from FX that I just discussed. Therefore, our full year revenue guidance is now expected to be between $11 billion and $11.050 billion. Adjusted EBITDA guidance has been narrowed and reaffirmed at the midpoint. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.393 billion and $2.407 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 7.6% to 8.2%. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has also been narrowed and reaffirmed at the midpoint. We now expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be between $6.30 and $6.40, which represents year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 15.3%. As expected, our adjusted book tax rate was more favorable than normal in the third quarter, but we do expect this to revert back in the fourth quarter and we are still estimating about 22% for the year. This guidance assumes that foreign currency rates at September 30 remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now turning to our resulting fourth quarter 2019 guidance. For the fourth quarter, revenue is expected to be between $2,807 million and $2,857 million, representing growth of 4.4% to 6.3% at actual FX rates, assuming a 100 basis point impact from foreign currency year-over-year. From a segment perspective, we expect fourth quarter growth in Technology and Analytics Solutions to moderate sequentially, reflecting the strong Q3 organic performance, a lower contribution from M&A, as well as a tougher expected comp year-over-year. In R&DS, we expect year-over-year services growth to be somewhat stronger than what you have seen in prior quarters. And in CSMS, we expect the trend to remain positive and consistent with our expectation for flattish revenue growth for the year. For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $635 million and $649 million, representing year-over-year growth of 8.9% to 11.3%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.65 and $1.75, which represents year-over-year growth of 10% to 16.7%. So in summary, we delivered third quarter results at the high end or above our guidance ranges. Revenue came in at the high end of our guidance range notwithstanding an approximate $20 million impact from foreign currency. Technology and Analytics Solutions and R&D Solutions sustained their strong momentum. OCE now has almost 70 wins since launch, including two important wins with top 15 pharma clients in the quarter. The R&D team secured another strong quarter of net new business with backlog and next 12 months revenue from backlog, both growing double digits year-over-year. And lastly, CSMS continues to improve. With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks, very much. Good morning. First off, just two questions. The new large pharma win, I know it was a TAS client. Was it also a commercial client prior to the R&D win? Was any of your existing sales to that pharma kind of a driver of this new opportunity, number one? Number two; could you give us a sense on maybe a framework of how to think about sizing it either in terms of bookings contribution this quarter or over the next year or maybe long-term revenue growth? And then I have maybe a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thanks Eric. Look, we're very excited. It took some time. As we've said many many times, unlocking previously locked out accounts, as they were known in the industry was a major goal for us. We've done a few by now. This one was a very important win that we had been working on literally for the past couple of years. We did win a couple of small studies, where they wanted to test out our new capabilities and see whether there was really real value there and that prompted them. So again, the main trigger and driver for the displacement here was our new set of smarter trial capabilities. And they decided to essentially replace their existing providers with us. I can't say much more. Bookings in the quarter, I can't -- I think we can get to that follow-up. But I don't think it was very significant. The preferred provider arrangement was executed in the quarter. That's why we are reporting it. But there was nothing much there. The pipeline for that particular client is very strong. And we do expect that this is going to result in significant bookings going forward.
Eric Coldwell: And just quickly, my follow-up here. The -- that client, I know you displaced two. I believe you also had another public CRO that was -- that participated in that win. So there are two of you in that new arrangement. Is that correct?
Ari Bousbib: Yes.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks, guys.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Erin Wright with Crédit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: In terms of the new business wins in the quarter I mean it sounds like you're still seeing the traction across large pharma. But can you speak to some of the traction across the smaller emerging biopharma segment? That was an area of focus during the Investor Day. And how should we be thinking about just the traction overall across that cohort? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I mean look Erin, you're specifically asking about core power and smarter trials correct?
Erin Wright: Yes. And traction across the emerging biopharma segment the smaller biotech.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So look we – obviously, we want to be balanced and we are balanced. The early days of the new solutions are -- probably more than 2/3 of our awards were with EBP clients. And I've said before it was a lot easier because single decision-making points, factor decision cycle in general less silos to go through. But along the way large pharma has been adopting the solution. And to date I think we have almost $6 billion of awards...?
Michael McDonnell: 5 20.
Ari Bousbib: 5 20 exactly that's right. On smart trials and on the dollar value almost 2/3 of that is with large pharma but it's quite significant. But in the quarter it continued that kind of a breakdown. We gave about 2/3 almost 2/3 of pharma and the balance EVP. And as I mentioned in my structural remarks, a very strong, continued strong EVP funding environment year-to-date at the level of 2017.
Erin Wright: Okay, great. And then on OCE you've made considerable headway there with 20 new deals you mentioned. I guess can you quantify how much that's lifting the Tech segment or the TAS segment? And can you speak to what's driving some of those business wins? And do you expect that momentum to continue here? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So as you know, we've been in the market with OCE for -- I think we announced the launch at the end of 2017 and we really took it to market at the beginning of 2018 so it's not even two years. It's one year and three quarters and we've had over 70 wins to date. It's a market that is occupied largely by one company. And we believe and the feedback from our customers is that our products and solutions are superior in terms of functionality, cost to deploy and efficiency and a number of other aspects. So we again won over 17 new customers for this new product. The sales cycle is fairly long. That's why people like technology. It's once you're in you're in for a long time. So it's hard to displace existing solutions. These are enterprise-wide solutions often and they -- switching costs are very high. But we're very pleased to have won so many new engagements. It takes time to deploy. If it's a global deployment, it could take one year or more or potentially two years if it's in a lot of countries. And the deployment phase does not contribute much. It's not so profitable, it's more labor-intensive in the initial phases. And of course the upside is when the solution is being used by the client and they pay size licenses which are -- which is really when we recoup our investments and contribute significantly to both revenue and profits. So I think in the quarter there wasn't much from the wins. No of course not. And there will be some contribution from implementation over the next 12 months but -- from these new wins but really not much to profits.
Erin Wright: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks. All right. Michael I was just hoping just on R&D solutions. Could you just walk through -- I know you had the pass-through kind of headwind this quarter. But in terms of getting to the organic growth -- I know you discussed M&A as well. Could you just give us kind of what was your organic growth this quarter? And when we think about what's expected kind of going forward I know the expectation is that continues to accelerate as the burn rate. You basically burned that very large backlog. So can you just walk us through a little bit about organic growth in the quarter and kind of what the outlook is?
Michael McDonnell: Sure. So I say for the total company we are -- we were in the quarter at -- or once you when you peel out the acquisition's contribution and the pass-throughs for the quarter total company grew at 7%. For the Technology Analytics Solutions, we were at almost 8%. And for the R&D Solutions was 6.8%.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. M&A and pass-through were roughly offset.
Michael McDonnell: Right, offset each other.
Dan Brennan: Got it. And then maybe could you just speak a little bit more to the large backlog and in terms of the burn rate and kind of how we think about that kind of going forward? I know the expectation was as you move through some of the older quintiles backlog and into the Next Gen backlog that you would begin to see that really convert. So I know, we're just guiding for Q4 right now. But just kind of walk us through a little bit about how to think about that large backlog burning going forward.
Ari Bousbib: You want to – yeah.
Michael McDonnell: Yes. So Dan, it's Mike. I'd say that you've seen -- if you calculate backlog burn just based on revenue over starting quarter backlog obviously, we've been adding backlog at a very advanced rate and so that percentage naturally decreases. And we're not -- it's not one that we're overly focused on. I think that the takeaway here as we mentioned in our prepared remarks is that we feel like we're very well-positioned. The bookings continue to be strong. We had a very good complement of core clinical bookings during the quarter in particular. And we do see the growth accelerating in R&DS as we head into 2020 as we said in our prepared remarks.
Dan Brennan: Great. Okay. I’ll leave it there. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So when we think about the fourth quarter guide and the conversion from revenue to EBITDA in terms of growth EBITDA growth is around 2 times to 1.8 times both sides of the range in terms of growth in more significant conversion that you guided to on your Analyst Day. So if we think about kind of like the mix of business for the fourth quarter how should we think about it in terms of where we are in the trial conversion and in any other things that are impacting fourth quarter guide? And then how should we think about this within the context of the mid-term guide? Should we think about this is a sign that there is upside opportunity to that EBITDA growth guidance that you've provided back in Investor Day?
Andrew Markwick: Hey, Ricky, it's Andrew. Sorry, can I clarify your question? You're asking about EBITDA ramp going into the fourth quarter and mid-term outlook for the quarter?
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. So EBITDA growth rate for the fourth quarter. Do we think kind of like nice acceleration versus kind of like the revenue growth? So how should we think about it within the context of the midterm guide that you provided on the Analyst Day?
Andrew Markwick: Yes. Looking at the fourth quarter in particular, I think, if you look back to last year we see a sequential ramp Q3 to Q4 for EBITDA. I think we had about 10% growth for EBITDA in the fourth quarter last year. And I'll guide this year and probably something very similar. The fourth quarter ramp is standard for our business. I mean, as a reminder we usually see our Technology and Analytics Solutions business ramp in the fourth quarter. That revenue is higher margin revenue and drives on a more sequential margin improvement during the year. And for the last few years, I think, Q4 EBITDA has come in around that same kind of proportion of full year EBITDA. I think as you think about the medium-term and EBITDA for us we've said that we're kind of delivering top-line acceleration. And we've always said that we don't want to give up on a point of revenue growth for margin expansion and that can deliver a lot more value over time. Now I think you're very familiar with our history and our commitment to margin expansion. And we've also said that we -- as well as delivering revenue acceleration we also want to deliver margin expansion as we go forward. Now it's not going to be to the same rate as you've seen in the past. But we're committed to that but we need to face the we're -- this acceleration is coming from technology deployments, which creates pressure to margins. We're investing -- we're still investing in data assets whether that be in the emerging markets or specialty areas. We've got to bring employees in and new recruits to deliver on the clinical trial side as we've won. So we've got a large backlog to deliver on. And we've also got to bring people in to deliver on the deployments from Roche and Novo as well as the other two top 15 pharma clients that we secured this quarter. So there's a lot going on in the base. We're committed to expansion. I think, the Q4 ramp is normal on a sequential basis and we've kind of laid out what to expect for the next few years.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And just one follow-up. When you think about -- you said that in the quarter M&A and pass-through offset each other. So how should we think about the M&A pipeline and acquisitions of interest and just capital deployment for remainder of this year and into next year?
Andrew Markwick: Yes I think we've always said that we look to deploy between $1 billion and $1.5 billion every year towards M&A and share repurchase. The size of share repurchase will obviously depend on M&A opportunities. But if you look at history on average we spend about $500 million a year on M&A. So that stepped down a little bit. I think so far this year we've deployed about $1 billion and the bulk of that has really gone toward share repurchase as we see the stock as a good investment.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks. First if you could talk about the impact to backlog and revenue going forward both for the Biogen Alzheimer's decision. Did you add back the $390 million that you had previously pulled out? And then also on the new preferred provider wins what does that do to the revenue ramp going forward?
Ari Bousbib: The good news with us is that no one client has an impact one way or the other. We have I want to remind you over 8,000 clients globally. And this is precisely the reason why when that particular client – we have a great relationship with Biogen obviously and we are committed to our strong partnership, because they advance the science. But when they decided to put that trial on hold and we took that out – made that adjustment out of our backlog we didn't change our revenue expectation. You will recall that. So just as – on the downside, it didn't affect us so too on the upside, there's not one client that is going to change our overall guidance for the year or in the years ahead. We did at our Investor Day indicate to all of you that our expectation for growth over the next three-year period 2020 to 2022 was higher growth rate as a company overall and for the R&D and the TAS segments in particular. And that includes – that included the expectation that we were going to win and we still expect to win more preferred provider. My reporting to you that we did sign that this preferred provider agreement with this other company is simply to support those growth – expected growth expectations. Those accelerated growth expectations. With respect to Biogen again so far obviously there is just a decision to re-apply. The particular work associated with it hasn't been yet signed or totally formalized, and therefore it's not in the backlog. I remind you that we changed three years ago our practice and only we – on back of that for which we are contracted for. And so that's not yet there.
Tycho Peterson: And then on OCE, it's great to see the momentum. Can you just spend a minute on what in your offering is particularly resonating relative to the competition as we think about some of these head to heads? What is really the differentiating factor?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. We've spoken about that -- this before. Andrew?
Andrew Markwick: Hi, Tycho. This is Andrew. I mean, OCE I think we've spent a long time in 2017 building it the new offering there. One of the key moves forward for us with the partnership with Salesforce we're obviously platforming OCE on a best-in-breed technology platform there and it helps with us in terms of the functionality. OCE for us also embeds multiple different functions so it's not just a CRM tool for sales reps. It also brings into the mix marketing campaign management, brings it into the next home office operation. So, I think when you look at the likes of the large pharma countries and many of the 70-plus wins we've had to date the clients like the fact that they can put this tool in the hands of more than one person within their organization. So both the sales rep and the marketing team have the same tool, they have the same version of the truth. The sales rep becomes aware that the marketing team is sending out email campaigns. They know what a doctor has done with that. They know, if the doctor has opened it, if they requested more information have they logged on to social media and commented about it. They just become a lot more informed. The tool also then uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help streamline the tasks. So, a sales rep will get suggestions for meeting invites. It will help place those calls in the sales rep's calendar. If a sales rep gets to the stage where they've got one last visit they can make in day it will use artificial intelligence to make next best doctor recommendations and look at rankings of doctors who their next best visit could be and where they can have the most success. So really we're bringing a very intuitive tool to market that brings together multiple functions within an organization and utilizes AI and machine learning within the application as well. And I think platforming on Salesforce is key as they've got a great technology there. They can focus on the platforming capabilities and it gives us the ability to really focus on building best-in-breed end user applications.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And if I could ask one last quick one? Are there any offsets on organic growth that you're factoring in you're leaving it unchanged despite the top line momentum? So as we think about the fourth quarter are there any kind of headwinds that left full year guidance unchanged on organic?
Ari Bousbib: Well, yeah, I think the – I mean Mike gave a commentary in his prepared remarks regarding the fourth quarter. I think TAS we obviously saw an acceleration this quarter. I think as you go into Q4 we see continued strength. There is – obviously a tough comp that's where we started to see the acceleration in Q4 2018. R&D continued to strengthen and on a services basis we expect an improvement. Don't forget we see lumpiness from pass-throughs. In this quarter, it was about 200 basis points headwind.
Michael McDonnell: And that's kind of flattish for the year as we've said.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I want to go back to the two new OCE wins you talked about. Could you maybe just walk through the framework for why they're starting in one geography in the U.S. and Asia and what the timeline would be to expand from there? What are they doing in other regions?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well I said before it's very hard to displace incumbents' technology providers by definition. We've said a long time ago that that was our goal. These are large companies, multiple therapeutic areas, other geographies. We're very pleased that for each one of them in a very large geography; U.S. and Asia respectively and for one of them even one particular therapy area we were able to do the displacement. Now it's natural that that's the way it works. We are working hard to expand our relationships with all our customers and we hope to expand from there.
Jack Meehan: Great. And maybe just on the investment side. If I look at the overall company level, gross margins were down year-over-year and I think down sequentially. So clearly there's a lot of investment going behind that. When do you think you hit the tipping point where the level of growth from these projects begins to accelerate to match the level of investments? So you had -- gross profit line that becomes more neutral?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Look we are more impatient than you are about margins. Trust me we're working very hard on trying to even sustain those margins. I think it's a very, very good level of performance given the amount of the investment and work that's going on. The first point I'd like to highlight is margin expansion can be lumpy between quarters and even years, okay? When we talk about margin expansion, we look at it in terms of trend line for multiple years. Now we've always said, we are not going to sacrifice top line growth or margins. You can do the math. One extra point of revenue growth is always -- delivers always more value to shareholders than one extra point of margin. Having said that, you know our history and our stated mission and that is that we're not going to compromise on margins. We've committed to an expanding margin trend line even though as you just pointed out there are quarters where that might not be the case. We explained during our recent investor conference and every time we interact with you guys that we have been investing for this growth acceleration and that can cause additional lumpiness in margin expansion. We get the large OCE deployments. We won Roche and Novo deployments globally. We are bringing a new suite of products to market the OCT, Orchestrated Clinical Trial, a suite of applications. We've been investing since the merger three years ago on the smarter trial automation techniques and we continue to do that. Virtual trials we continue doing very expensive data scientists and software experts. They are expensive. We compete in the marketplace. This is a view unemployment economy. So all of that has -- if we did nothing else certainly our margins would contract. That's not the case on the trend line. And of course there's also a mix impact. Our data business which is very high margin is essentially flat and the other businesses are growing. These are businesses that won't have as attractive margins. We've acquired some businesses. Most of the time these businesses are small, low profit or no profit margin contributors and that also adds to the problem in the mix. And finally the good news is the CSMS business is improving, but it cost us lower margins. So it will affect our margins. So we are dealing with a growth horizon that's very attractive with topline acceleration. In order to generate that we've got to invest, that's obviously headwinds to our margins. We're dealing with a change in the mix and that also is a headwind to our margins. So we expect to see margin expansion resume in the fourth quarter. That's what I expect. Now that's in line with normal seasonality in the business and look we are the highest margin performer in certainly in the industry and certainly if you compare to our publicly traded peers on the clinical trial side on the CRO side by several points. And so we continue to face pressure from competition. We're squeezing them. We've been gaining share over these competitors. There's one place they can go to and we're trying very hard to hold the line. So this is the context we're facing. Now in this context to come in with our profits above our midpoint guidance, I think is very good and we're very pleased with that. I know you're impatient. You'd like to see further margin acceleration and we too and we expect that to happen over the mid-term as we signaled at our investor conference.
Jack Meehan: Appreciate it. Thanks, Ari.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I just -- the book-to-bill metric is one that investors focus on a little bit. And if you just compare sequentially from Q2 to Q3, it looks like I think from the reported number 1.35 to 1.31. Can you just comment a little bit on, is this just the vagaries of the lumpiness of how contracts fall out? Or is this quarter have any particular -- anything different about it in terms of contract signings versus what we've seen from prior quarters. It looks like Q2 is a particularly strong contract signing quarter?
Ari Bousbib: There's nothing unique about quarters. This is exactly as you said some of this is lumpiness in quarters when the contracts get signed. I remind you that we are on a contracted basis. So the contract gets signed by the end of the quarter it's in the quarter. If it's not it's going to be next quarter. So I don't -- I wouldn't read too much. The environment remains very healthy. Our pipeline of qualified leads is growing high-teens versus prior year. It's really very, very strong across the board, particularly strong bookings I might add to give you a bit more color on the full clinical side of the house. Really, really strong. I mean, I don't normally want to give those numbers. But in the full clinical side, which is the more attractive segment of what we do it's actually over 1.5 in the quarter on a services basis, which is really what matters frankly. I don't know why people pay any attention, whatsoever, on book-to-bill ratios on a 606 basis. They are absolutely meaningless. The lumpiness and difficulty to approximate pass-through payments. As you know when you look at our numbers on an LTM basis, we had that big adjustment in the first quarter, which we were just reminded of a moment ago by one of your colleagues. And that was disproportionately weighted towards pass-throughs. So really to -- first of all we got to focus on LTM numbers. And I strongly encourage you to ask from our peers that they give you the number on a services revenue-only because these pass-throughs are extremely lumpy, they can vary a lot by mix of business and there is a high degree of estimation -- probability estimation judgment involved. And we want -- we tend to be extremely conservative. So that's all I'll say on that. But again I won't derive any significant conclusions one quarter versus the other. This is a -- it's very strong. We're gaining share. We continue to have a very strong momentum on our bookings. The team is executing superbly and it frankly is exceeding our expectations.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, if you don't mind one follow-up. Just on the OCE. There's been a lot of wins. Number one, do you have the manpower to really deploy all these different wins in a timely basis? And then over how many years of the 20 that you won, I mean how many years does it take to deploy them before they're at a steady state where you can grow them from there?
Ari Bousbib: Okay, I'll take the last part of your question. Most of those wins, it's about -- they are with mid-sized or EBT segment and those will take no more than a year to deploy. The large pharma deals again if it's one country, one geography it's also about a year, at the most six months to a year. When you've got large deployments like the Roche win, which is in over 100 countries then that could take a couple of years, year and half to a couple of years. And then that's when you start seeing the ramp and the revenue and profit contribution, which we are starting to see from the wins last year. So that should come in. And at that time in the -- if you want to quantify it, I would say towards the middle to end part of 2020, we should start seeing significant contribution from all those wins accumulated to date. And as to the manpower, you are absolutely correct. This is to someone else's question earlier, this is what's causing some pressure on our margin is we've got to hire the people. We've got to -- and they are expensive. They are a scarce commodity and strong economy. Thank God. So we are facing the costly manpower deployments in the initial stages. But look we're here for the long-term. We will deliver much higher margin otherwise we compromise longer term growth prospects and we don't want to do that.
Michael McDonnell: I think we've got lots of question in the queue, but I think we're coming up on the hour. So let's try and squeeze in one more. And then I think that will be our last question for today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Windley: Thanks very much. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, with the -- I want to focus on TAS. With the growth in OCE in particular, you've talked in the past about kind of the three pieces of TAS being about one-third, one-third, one-third. I wondered if you could update us on, the relative contributions of those. I figured that may have migrated a little bit. Second, if you could talk about -- Ari you mentioned, OCT clinical trials. And its progress, maybe more specifically, where is it, in its go-to-market commercial availability? Have you won any clients there, yet? And then lastly, you talked about -- you have talked about in the past, kind of 500 trials on the smart trial platform and maybe 200 of those, having completed patient recruitment I believe, if you could update us on, any perspective around that. So, I sneaked in three. Hopefully, you'll take them. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: That's a nice try. Three highly granular specific strong questions, I know we would spend an hour on these. Okay. Let's quickly take -- you want to talk about quickly the breakdown of TAS...?
Andrew Markwick: The TAS segment, yeah, I mean, I think, we told you before that segment is roughly about 4.5 billion. I think you're right David it kind of breaks out roughly into one-third, one-third, one-third of that segment is the legacy IMS data offering which is kind of script and wholesaler data which you pretty much sell to everyone. But in order to grow in other areas, we maintain that business flat. So you should expect kind of flattish growth in that area. The two growth drivers in the segment are really real-world and technology. They're growing nice double digits. Real-world obviously, a little bit of acceleration this quarter as well driving organic growth for the segment up to the 8%, mark and tech continues to be strong as well. And then you're left with kind of analytics and services based businesses which are kind of in that mid-single-digit range. They could be a little bit lumpy, maybe high single, low single, but kind of mid-single growth on average I think, so that, gets you to that kind of the growth rate we're seeing now of the segment inching towards high single-digit organic growth. And then the acceleration going forward will come from those, kind of, the areas that are higher quality, higher margin, for the future which is real-world and technology.
Ari Bousbib: Second question?
Andrew Markwick: What was your second question again Dave can you just remind me of that?
David Windley: OCT, OCT and where it is in its commercial traction?
Andrew Markwick: Yeah. The traction there, yeah, I think the branded offering we've said before, we're looking to deploy that in the end of 2020, and coming up to the end of this year. So the full suite isn't in market yet. We've had success with different parts we're offering. So if you look at our regulatory compliance, tech platforms vigilance and so on they're around in the market. We've had good success there. Mobile CRA, we've actually got the bulk of our CRAs in the organization actually using mobile CRA. And we're trying to sell that to our clients as well. eTMF which is one that's in the market as well and we've had some good success. I'd note that, the Roche deal that we announced previously was for the OCE contract. eTMF is one thing they bought, but they bought it on the commercial side. We made a kind of a horizontal play there, and built that platform out for commercial content management capabilities, as well. So we've already got large Pharma kind of coming to the table and interested in these offerings. I think, the 70-plus OCE deals, we've had so far this year, plus -- and the fact that we've had Roche and Novo sign up and two more top 15 large pharma clients this quarter goes to show further that we're building ourselves to become an increasingly larger technology-based company. And I think, that's where we want our growth to come from in the future.
Ari Bousbib: And the third -- the third question.
Andrew Markwick: And your third question Dave, I think was around...
David Windley: Was just kind of the 200 to 500 trials that have progressed on smart trial?
Ari Bousbib: Smart trials, yeah.
Andrew Markwick: Yeah. And we've seen a lot of success with the trials. And you're right we said at our Analyst Day that we had roughly 200 trials that were kind of deep into the mix where we were able to monitor and look at the success, we're having versus trials we've had in the past. We said then that the speed and in terms of reduction -- in site, I think, comes versus historical benchmarks, we were thinking about a 40% improvement. And predictability, which would be the reduction in non-enrolling terms versus historical benchmarks was around 60%, and productivity improvements in terms of faster recruitment rates versus historical benchmarks was around 30% at actual...
Ari Bousbib: So David was asking how many more, I mean, we solely can give some stats on what we sold.
Andrew Markwick: In terms of what we've sold, we've got 5.8 billion in terms of customer -- awards for the core pilot smart trials.
Ari Bousbib: This quarter it was down to 700, what was the number?
Andrew Markwick: In terms of...?
Ari Bousbib: The next day.
Andrew Markwick: I was just looking it was something like $700 million this quarter in terms of the bookings. And as Ari said that, kind of from launch to the offering to date about two-thirds of those are with large pharma. So everything large pharma increasing...
Ari Bousbib: 13 in that line.
David Windley: Okay. Great, thanks very much.
Andrew Markwick: Okay. Thanks very much Dave. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us today. And we look forward to speaking with everyone again on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. There are still a lot of questions in the queue. So Jen and I will be available to take any follow-ups for the rest of the day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you. And have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on our Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter 2019 earnings call. It was great to see you all at our Analyst and Investor Conference just last month. As you recall the objective of the event was to take stock of our progress since the merger which was almost three years ago and to lay out the path forward to 2022. We are all very proud of the unique company that has been created from this merger. Turning to our Q2 earnings release, this quarter was largely a repeat of the first quarter with continued strong momentum and similar outstanding financial and operational performance. Once again, both revenue and earnings came in above our guidance ranges. Second quarter revenue of $2,740,000,000 came in above our guidance range, resulting in constant currency revenue growth of 8.5%. From a segment perspective, technology and analytics solutions revenue grew 11.4% at constant currency and organic growth was the same as last quarter about 7%. This strong performance was again driven by solid double-digit growth in our real world and technology businesses. R&D solutions revenue grew 7.5% on constant currency. Excluding pass through constant currency growth was 8.8% with acquisitions contributing about 150 basis points to R&D revenue growth. Again similar to last quarter, organic constant currency growth was over 7%. As you recall, we said contract sales in medical solutions will return to growth in the second half of 2019 with the objective of flat revenue year-over-year. I am pleased to report that the CSMS business has turned the corner in the second quarter, growing 1% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $578 million was towards the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53 was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 18.6%. And we'll provide a brief update on our business in technology first OCE continues to gain traction in the market and there is a tremendous amount of excitement from clients and prospects about our revolutionary solution. So far in 2019, our technology team has won over 20 new OCE engagements resulting in over 50 OCE win since the SaaS offering was launched just 18 months ago. You saw that orchestrated analytics for OCE was launched in April. This is an important enhancement of the platform which leverages AI and machine learning to identify our recommend next best action through the sales reps. This is a level of insight that surfaces any capabilities that are available in the market today. Turning to real-world, this quarter, the team was awarded a large contract with a consortium of life science companies to demonstrate the long-term safety for a certain kind of agent that is used in a common procedure. This research was mandated by the FDA and the choice of IQVIA as a consortium's partner in this important study demonstrates our leadership in this area. In addition, our clients are increasingly looking for a partner in the real world space. During the quarter, we were named a preferred provider for large pharma company. This award includes more than 20 real world engagements over the next five years and covers all regional studies, which will implemented a new hybrid outsourcing model combining both in-source and outsourced services. Our capabilities in both prospective research and advanced machine learning based predictive analytics really set us apart from the competition. Moving to R&D, the team continued their momentum with another strong quarter of net new business, backlog of over $18 billion grew almost 15% year-over-year. Our bookings growth and book-to-bill ratios remain robust and whatever way you look at it, we had another great quarter for R&D bookings. For the quarter, our book-to-bill on an as contracted 606 basis, that is including pass-throughs was 159, excluding pass-throughs our book-to-bill was 135 for the quarter. Looking at the last 12 months, our book to bill on an as contracted 606 basis was 141 excluding pass-throughs, the book-to-bill is still at 150 on an LTM service basis. In addition, the R&D team secured another record quarter of over $800 million of core power gross new business awards, which excludes pass-throughs associated with these bookings. We now have over $5.1 billion in core power smart trial awards since launch again that is excluding pass-throughs. Finally, I'd like to recognize the work of our management team to turnaround of contract sales business. We are beginning to see the fruits of their efforts with the stabilization of business and even a return to modest growth. In sum, we have a very, very strong quarter across all our businesses. And now Mike will review the financials in more detail.
Mike McDonnell: Thank you Ari, and good morning everyone. As you have seen, we had another solid quarter. Let's turn first to revenue. Second quarter revenue of $2.740 billion grew 6.7% reported and 8.5% at constant currency. First half revenue of $5.424 billion grew 5.7% reported and 7.8% at constant currency. Second quarter Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1.102 billion grew 9% reported and 11.4% at constant currency. Technology & Analytic Solutions first half revenue of $2.177 billion grew 9.1% reported and 12.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions' second quarter revenue of $1.435 billion grew 6.3% at actual FX rates and 7.5% at constant currency. First half R&D Solutions revenue of $2.851 billion grew 5% at actual FX rates and 6.4% at constant currency. Second quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $203 million declined 1.5% reported and grew 1% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, we expected this business to transition to growth as the year progresses after several years of decline. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions first half revenue of $396 million declined 5.5% at actual FX rates and 3.1% at constant currency. Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $578 million for the second quarter and $1.165 billion for the first half of 2019. Second quarter GAAP net income was $60 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.30. First half GAAP net income was $118 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.59. Adjusted net income was $306 million for the second quarter and $615 million for the first half of the year. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 18.6% year-over-year to $1.53. First half adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.06 grew 16.3%. Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at June 30, 2019 was $18.03 billion and the amount of backlog that we expect to convert to revenue over the next 12 months is approximately $4.9 billion. Let's now review the balance sheet. At June 30 cash and cash equivalents totaled $938 million and debt was $11.399 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.461 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.5 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $391 million in the second quarter. CapEx was $155 million and free cash flow was $236 million. We repurchased $236 million of our stock during the second quarter at an average price of $134.65. Let's now turn to 2019 guidance. We are raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance from between $10.900 billion and $11.125 billion to now be between $11 billion and $11.150 billion. This guidance assumes the same FX headwind that was built into our previous guidance of about 100 basis points. This update to our revenue guidance range is mainly driven by our year-to-date organic performance in Technology & Analytics Solutions and a strong organic outlook in this segment for the rest of the year. We are affirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance at the midpoint of the range and tightening the range by $10 million on both ends as we now have more visibility. The new range is $2.385 billion to $2.415 billion. We are also raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05, so the range moves from between $6.20 to $6.40 to between $6.25 and $6.45. Please note that for the below the line items, depreciation is tracking a bit lower than expected and interest a bit higher, essentially offsetting each other. We now expect depreciation to be about $300 million and interest about $450 million for the year. The adjusted book tax rate is always lumpy quarter to quarter, but we are still on a trend of about 22% for the year. Depending on tax efficiencies, we could see favorability to that number of at least half a point. The adjusted cash tax rate is still expected to be about 15% for the year. The guidance provided assumes that foreign currency rates at June 30 remain in effect for the rest of 2019. As in prior quarters, we are also providing guidance for the coming quarter. For the third quarter, assuming foreign currency remains at June 30 rates through the end of the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.730 billion and $2.780 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $580 million and $595 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.53 and $1.59. Please note, based on the tax rate guidance I just mentioned, we do expect third quarter adjusted book tax rate to be about the same as Q2 but then we expect it will ramp in the fourth quarter resulting in the full year tax rate guidance that I just discussed. Year-to-date, this guidance represents revenue growth of 5.6% to 6.2%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.3% to 7.3%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13.3% to 14.8%. So in summary, we delivered second quarter results above or at the high end of our guidance ranges. Technology & Analytics Solutions and R&D Solutions sustained their strong momentum. CSMS continues to improve. OCE now has over 50 wins with 20 added so far this year. The R&D team secured another record quarter of core powered gross new business wins of over $800 million. The book-to-bill ratio including pass-throughs was 1.59 times for the quarter. The LTM book-to-bill excluding pass-throughs was 1.50 times and we have raised our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. With that, let me hand it back to the operator and we can open things for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Jones: I guess, just two quick ones on RDS. Ari clearly mentioned the strength there. You evidenced in all the results and metrics you shared. You did grow backlog at an accelerated rate off of what appeared to be a fairly difficult comp. So it might just be across the board, but I'm curious if there is anything to parse out of maybe where you saw incremental strength in this quarter across bookings relative to where you had been trending. And then just one housekeeping question. I know you guys removed a large BIP cancellation last quarter from backlog, but I was curious if you would be willing to share how much of that continue to show up in revenue in the quarter.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Let me just address the second part. Very little. Okay. So negligible. So this is behind us essentially, whether it's in the bookings numbers or in the revenue number is just out. The first question you asked was what, the color on the bookings. I would say we had an exceptionally strong bookings quarter. And you know, you might have noted a little disconnect on the book-to-bills, other than the fact that it just comes to show that what we've been saying forever, which is don't rely on book-to-bill ratios and don't use them to compare across the board, because there are so many variables that affect that fraction. So you noted - we reported 1.59x book-to-bill on a 606 basis, which is extremely strong. And excluding pass-through is 1.35x, which is also extremely strong on a services basis. And the reason for the disconnect, if you will, is a mix issue. If we had the same proportion of CORE clinical, FSP, lab and other type of work, then you will have the exact same proportion of pass-throughs. We've said before and I want to repeat it here for clarification, CORE clinical bookings which are the most attractive portion of our business, as you know they are higher margins, they are the whole suite of services, typically come in with more pass-throughs. So what this indicates to you here with this very strong 1.59x number is that the proportion - the relative proportion in the mix of bookings in the quarter of CORE clinical is significantly higher than it has been on a normalized basis historically. That's very good news. It is higher quality bookings. Now it happens to be, the fraction is higher because the revenue which is the denominator in the quarter is still suffering from a headwind from pass-throughs. So you've got two things going on here, you have higher quality bookings with a higher mix relative to normal of CORE clinical bookings and you have relatively less pass-throughs on the revenue in the denominator, because we're still executing now historic bookings, which were a lower mix of CORE clinical and as a result of which you've got still a headwind because of a decline of pass-throughs year-over-year. I hope that's clear. And again the reverse trend on the - when you do the LTM, again you will see the same explanation. I'm just giving this expanded explanation because I want to A, show that be careful when you given a book-to-bill ratio, there is a lot underneath. And number two, in our case, we chose to give you everything this quarter. Hopefully to convey to you how strong the bookings are not just on the dollar number, but also as I just explained in terms of the quality and the mix. Included in this mix, of course, is the very - much higher proportion of CORE powered smart clinical trials, all of which are CORE and all of which come with a lower pass-throughs, because again they are all encompassing sets of services. I hope that gives you the kind of color you were looking maybe even more.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken, Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Muken: Maybe on the TAS business-the tech business, you gave us some good color on OCE. Obviously that continues to have momentum. But it feels like in general, there is a number of other parts kind of contributing in kind of the SaaS based part of the business to kind of the overall growth rate being elevated. And it seems like also some of the M&A you've brought in over the years obviously helping to accelerate growth there. Just maybe give us a feel for outside of just OCE contributing some of the other pieces that are helping that business get to kind of high single-digit growth, which obviously is a material acceleration of where you've been.
Ari Bousbib: Well, thank you for the questions. Yes, you're correct OCE is not exactly contributing a huge amount here because as you know the wins have just been occurring over the past 18 months and we are largely in implementation phase. We're not yet generating the attractive license, SaaS revenues associated with those deployments. We're more in implementation phase for most of those. And so that's to come. So the suite of products that contributed strongly to generating this 7% organic - continued 7% organic growth rate on TAS, as you know we said at our Analyst Meeting and I'm saying it again here, this business roughly, you can think of it as three portions. One-third is our traditional data business and that business essentially, you can assume grows at nothing, zero, flat. One-third is services businesses, outsourcing businesses essentially time and labor-based type of economic model and that grows mid-single digits. And then you have got one-third of those businesses that are a plus, little bit more now is almost 40% that are the double-digit high growers and those are technology services that includes the suites of products we talked about at the investor conference, including safety, compliance, pharmacovigilance, some of the critical products that we have introduced a clinical technology suite. So all of those are contributing to very strong double-digit growth in our technology portfolio, and then of course, you've got the real world business, which is very strong. As I mentioned in my introductory commentary, this is really the future, this is where we're seeing going toward personalized medicine toward being able to anticipate diagnosis earlier with a lot more AI and machine learning and predictive analytics that hopefully we can get to a point that we are seeing this already in certain therapies where we can anticipate that someone will be diagnosed with a specific disease and we hope to talk some more about this in the future. But this is really what everyone has been striving for. We've said before, we have the tools, we have the assets, we have the people and the technology to bring it together and this is why we've been growing very strong double-digit. So that's really what's going on in that segment and that is supporting our 7% continued organic growth rate.
Ross Muken: And maybe just going back to the question prior on the R&D business. I mean, it feels like, you've obviously had several quarters in a row of superior bookings. It's quite clear you're gaining share but you are also continuing to invest in the business. You see it in the CapEx line in terms of software CapEx and then in all of the sort of efforts you outlined at the Analyst Day, and many of those tools. I guess as you think about sort of your advantage versus the peer group continuing to kind of increase, how are you thinking about the realization of that at the customer side. Like in terms of them continuing to see, you have more and more progress, I would think at some point, there's sort of a watershed event where a continued larger proportion of customers start coming to you and asking about tools as opposed to you having to push some of the NextGen offerings out to them on the market. Like how far do you think we are from that place where that's sustainable sizable advantage becomes kind of clear to the customers?
Ari Bousbib: Well, again, I think in terms of the runway ahead of us, we are extremely optimistic in terms of the specific smart trials technology, I mean we're just, I don't know, second or third inning at best. We've got ways to go. Look we have somewhere around 50 pharma customers that have bought these solutions on the R&D side with 175 biotech customers. We've got 12 of the top 20 pharma doing work there, 5 previously locked account that have been unlocked, so there is a lot of potential left. We've got dozens of clients. We have ways to go and I think we've got great runway.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Goldwasser, your line is open. Please go ahead. We cannot hear you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tycho Peterson: I want to ask about the EBITDA outlook given that it's unchanged. Given that CORE is higher margin and a higher proportion, shouldn't we see a bit of a tailwind going down the road? Just curious why EBITDA margins aren't being increased with the revenue guidance increase.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you. Down the road is right. Again, when we sell our technology solutions we've got a significant phase of implementation, deployments in the field that typically has essentially no margin. So that's a headwind. Secondly, we've got investments that we're making. Obviously, software development, significant portion is capitalized. But we still have extra costs that are in the P&L and in our margin so that's a headwind as well. We've got our investments that we're making and continue to make in business development, higher cost resources, in order to take all of our technology solutions to market whether - by the way, it's also true in R&DS. We just spoke a moment ago, in the prior question about our runway for our smart trials and while we would love to be as - we're always suggesting in a position where we are just sitting and clients are coming knocking at the door, we are not quite there yet. This is not the world we live in. It's still a very highly competitive marketplace and we need to bring these solutions to market. You all have been - become very familiar with our capabilities and what we believe is our unique competitive advantages, but we still have to believe it or not every client in the world knows about this or is aware of the capabilities and these are long cycle selling efforts. People don't buy OCE just on a whim or because they saw an ad at the bus stop. The clinical trial is a long selling process and so we do need business development resources that's an investment as well. All of that is headwind to margins. So in terms of the investments, OCE is a big area of investment, OCT is a big area of investment, smart trial, automation, virtual trials we've got more and more data scientists, software deployment teams, all of those are headwinds. And again I'll remind you we live in a - at least in the US in a full employment economy, so there is wage inflation. All of those are headwinds to our EBITDA margins and, frankly, it is great performance that we are able to do that and still generate the margins that we're generating. And that's because we continue with the programs of cost containment and we are - and continuing to be committed to margin expansion. During the year in particular, in '19, our investments are more first-half weighted and we expect to see the majority of adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion toward the back end of the year. And by the way that has been the case consistently. If you look back at the pattern in prior years, typically we've got the nice ramp first and second quarter. We did have a lull in the third quarter. That's kind of, I don't know, a lot of reasons for it but that's typically what happens. And then we have more of a ramp, more of a hockey stick, if you will, in the fourth quarter. But we've done it before, if you go back and check and so we feel confident about that. That's why we beat first half adjusted diluted EPS, so there is less of a ramp in Q3, and then we raised our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 and that's - we expect them to see most of that upside in the fourth quarter, including on our EBITDA margins. Thank you.
Tycho Peterson: And then one follow-up, can you comment on emerging biopharma, how were awards in the quarter and how are your efforts going to go after the mid-cap biopharma - biotech customer base?
Ari Bousbib: The environment continues, as far as we can tell, seems to be very strong. There is no change to the funding environment in terms of the biotech funding. Venture funding according to the National Venture Capital Association, through the end of Q2 is running about level with last year's annual rate, which as you know was exceptionally a strong and a record year. Year to date, in terms of deal value for us it was like $11 billion or so. We did 729 deals so far.
Mike McDonnell: That's the market information.
Ari Bousbib: That's the market information, yes - and then - I think it's about 50-50, is that - can you confirm that? The numbers before.
Mike McDonnell: Yeah. So bookings in the quarter for EBP versus large are about 50-50. I think very soon after the merger, we saw a lot of uptake from emerging biopharma. But I think our CORE-powered awards now are really getting more balanced than a lot of the growth that's coming from the larger or mid-sized clients. But as Ari said, the environment is very healthy, and we're still seeing good demand across the emerging biopharma space.
Ari Bousbib: Essentially, it was - the awards were 50-50 large pharma-EBP.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, correct.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, thanks.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you .
Andrew Markwick: I think we were going to try Ricky again, operator if Ricky Goldwasser is on the line.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you for taking the question. So, a question on the bookings. To your earlier point, the bookings is composed actually of higher quality business. So can you just kind of like remind us what type of margin is associated with these bookings versus enterprise? And also kind of like, how should we think about the timeline or the lag between when you recorded the booking and when we see the impact on margin kind of like that margin expansion?
Ari Bousbib: So the first question, I'm not going to answer. It's a nice try, though. We're not giving a margin profile. That's highly sensitive and competitive information, so we're not giving margin profiles. But it's just a fact it's an acknowledged - it's just a fact that lowest margin is for FSP which is, we provide a lot of CRAs and maybe a little bit of value, but essentially is the lowest margin in our - in general in the CRO marketplace. You've got the lab business which has maybe a little bit higher margins but not that much. You've got the stats business and the data science and really the higher margin business. The one everyone is after is what we call core clinical, which is essentially the full outsourcing of the full clinical trial that includes all of the above. And that's obviously because it includes the higher value-added activities in a clinical trial, by definition, have higher margins and relatively lower labor content on the total mix of revenue. So that's the background for why its higher margin. To the second question, when does that happen. As you know, it takes time to activate the sites and to start trials. So, usually you get to the peak activity within 18 months to 2 years of the start of a trial, that's when you get to peak revenue and margin realization
Ricky Goldwasser: So very much in line with the long-term guidance.
Ari Bousbib: And of course when you close out the trial, which usually is 3 to 4 years into the trial. Okay?
Ricky Goldwasser: So very much in line with the long-term guidance that's provided in Analyst Day, kind of like that's more backend loaded?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about - you updated the OCE contracts. Can you talk about how many of them were competitive takeaways? And what your kind of competitive win rate is recently and has it changed or over the last quarter, last 6 months, last 18 months with some of the - with the OCE launch?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean look - every situation is a competitive situation. We are competing with the same set of characters on every single one and every client looks at the same solutions that are in the marketplace. Our win rates somewhere is stabilized around two-thirds - or above 60% to two-thirds of the competition that we participate in. So that's - Andrew, do you have any further color?
Andrew Markwick: Historically, the team probably would have one in three and we're now at two in three.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan: I was hoping maybe just a little bit more color on the pacing of the revenue recognition related to some of the OCE deployments. And I guess what I'm trying to get to is if you look at the organic growth in TAS it was 7% the last couple of quarters. Do you think this is actually something that should be stepping up as we go into year-end. How should we be thinking about that?
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, we want to continue selling strongly as we can and so, you will always have layers of new OCE deployments and other technology solution deployments. As we told you, the increase in our full year revenue guidance is mainly driven by our year-to-date organic performance in Technology Analytics Solution. And of course, we continue to see a strong organic outlook in this segment for the rest of the year. I wouldn't assume 7% is the new constant currency, organic run rate, but we are definitely inching toward sustainable high single digit organic growth in this segment and we provided you with guidance a month ago for the next three years in terms of - and we expect this to be accelerating toward the double-digit type of rate in - toward the end of that 3-year period, meaning in toward the end of 2022. I mean if you step back and you look at our businesses and what we've been doing since the merger, there was an integration phase, which we thought would be 3 years. It's turned out to be only 2 years or little bit more than 2 years. We're now in at an inflection point where we're seeing acceleration of our top line and we hope to sustain and increase that acceleration over the next 3 year period. And then our expectation is that we will then get to a level of scale and market penetration that will enable us to hopefully - I didn't even say that at the investor conference, I'll say it now, our goal is certainly to be in double-digit territory when we get to the end of that period across the businesses.
Jack Meehan: Mike, I had one quick follow-up. Is there any color you can give just on the pass-throughs in the back half? I know for R&D, I know it's been a little bit of a headwind in the last couple of quarters. Do you expect that to persist or could it actually flip? Any color would be great.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, I think that the pass through headwinds are lumpy. We talked about in the first quarter, it was over 300 basis points. Second quarter was maybe roughly half of that. And I think that overall, what we're seeing in R&DS is maybe pass through headwind for the year, a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated with M&A roughly offsetting that. So overall organically in about the same place.
Jack Meehan: Makes sense. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Yes, I agree with what Mike just said now. I think it's lumpy as we go through the year. We told you a 100 basis points is embedded in our full year guidance, maybe little bit more that now, but I mean we're giving you our best estimate that we see right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Brennan: I joined a few minutes late. I'm just wondering Ari and Mike, for the guidance, for the rest of the year organically, was anything updated there and can you just kind of clarify that? Thanks.
Andrew Markwick: Yes, Ari just mentioned in one of the other questions, Dan I think really we're seeing organic strength in the TAS segment right now. We've come out at 7% in Q1, 7% in Q2. So a lot of our full year guidance range is due to that organic strength that we're seeing in the Technology & Analytics Solutions business. I don't think 7% is probably the new run rate for the rest of the year but its definitely inching toward that high single digit organic growth business. So we're pleased the range went up by $100 million at the low end, $25 million at the high end and we're definitely seeing strength across the board.
Dan Brennan: And Andrew, thank you for that. And then on the R&D side, similarly, I apologize, but like anything change there from an organic basis, how you're thinking about the back half?
Andrew Markwick: No change to what we said before. We're still kind of tracking to our expectations for the year.
Dan Brennan: And then I know, earlier in the conversation, Ari, you were discussing again some of the kind of NextGen trends. Could you just remind us - and I know the Analyst Day was only a month or so ago - like what percent of your clients have actually seen NextGen today and kind of how would you characterize the win rate on NextGen offering versus your non-NextGen offering? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, again, a very - continues the trend that you saw that we discussed a month ago and I just mentioned, I guess, before you joined the call, some of those numbers, we continue to bring this to market and we have in total I guess...
Andrew Markwick: We have 8,000 clients across the enterprise.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. We have 8,000 clients plus and only I guess 200 and maybe a little bit less than 250 are active customers now with our - the NextGen solution, our smart trial solution, so we continue the momentum and there is a lot of runway ahead of us. But I mentioned this before, so I'm sure you'll get all those numbers. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Sandy Draper: Most of my operational questions have been asked and maybe just a quick one for Mike. When you think about the step up in the interest looks obviously - the debt's going up, I don't know, just remind me in terms of floating rate, if we continue to see a low-interest rate environment, at some point does that start to offset. And then just sort of thoughts about managing - because cash flow is obviously better this quarter, when we think about balance of this year and into next year, how you guys are thinking about buying back stock versus and using debt to do that, just trying to understand more so the nuances of the capital structure. Thanks, Mike.
Mike McDonnell: Sure, Sandy. So the first question, we have very little exposure to rate variances we've got. Effectively when you look at our fixed versus variable rate mix on the surface, it's about 50-50, but when you look at the swaps and the caps and the collars and all those other pieces, effectively we're about 80% fixed. So to put it in context, 25 basis point rate hike is like $6 million. It's very, very kind of insensitive to rate movements. So I think that very little exposure to rate movements. Overall, we continue to see our stock as a very good investment. We've still got a significant amount of share buyback authorization, as you saw in our earnings release. And we'll continue to be a buyer of our stock in terms of debt levels. We ended the quarter at 4.5 times, which is right in the sweet spot of where we said we would be. And as we said in our investor conference, we expect to come down over time exiting 2022 at more like 3.5x to 4x, so we still are in very much the same place and are going to continue to manage the balance sheet, as we've said.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: You mentioned the new real world preferred partnership. How should we think about the contributions from a win like this in the real world space? And should this contribute more meaningfully over time and what was the genesis of the relationship? How much of it was the function of what you have in terms of the global data assets or what does the - customer that you were working with previously maybe from a NextGen perspective? And then I guess I have a second question just on cost cutting. You've obviously been very diligent there. During your Investor Day you highlighted as part of Vision 2022 kind of the next wave of cost cutting. I think you mentioned that you were still identifying some of the key initiatives there and the progression there on in terms of the cost savings. I guess, what have you identified thus far and how should we be thinking about the progression of the next wave from a cost-cutting standpoint? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Erin. I guess on the real world side and just repeat what we've been saying before, we've got the unique set of capabilities. We spoke at length about the human data science cloud and the infrastructure we have built, which is really what allows data to be consumed. This is a critical issue in healthcare and the most vexing problem that many companies have been confronting. Even assuming you could source all the data that's required, the scale that's required. And again, I want to remind you, no one comes close even at the fraction level in terms of the scope, that granularity and global coverage, but the linking of those data assets, the interoperability of those data assets and the work that we do from a technology standpoint to be able to mine and utilize and consume those analytics and then the technology layer of artificial intelligence and predictive analytics that's required. So it's the combination of those assets. Again with the unmatched therapeutic expertise that our company can bring forwards in any engagement. I'll remind you, we're running more than 2,500 trials - clinical trials. There's just no one in the world that has that kind of therapeutic coverage and scale on a global level. When you combine all of those assets and we've spent the bulk of our time over the past few years integrating these assets in developing solutions that are push-of-a-button type of analytics and that's kind of very unique. And so we were the obvious partner here for these consortium of pharma. This is an agent that is very commonly used, in a very common procedure that I think every one of us has undertaken at one point in time or another. And there are questions on safety and naturally the FDA and these consortium of partners came to us. And that's over the next 5 years. It's a big job over the next 5 years. Again, in the aggregate, revenue of our company is it's not going to be something that's going to move the needle in a dramatic fashion, if that was your question. But again, it's just one unusual, the type of engagement that essentially demonstrates that we are - our capabilities put us head and shoulders above anything that's out there.
Erin Wright: Okay. And then I guess on the...
Ari Bousbib: And regarding the second question, that was on.
Andrew Markwick: Cost savings.
Erin Wright: Yes, just on the cost cutting.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean, look, I gave enough color on that. We basically are done with the identification. We know what we're going to be doing is some refinement between now and the end of the year, but we essentially will be launching these programs, early next year. And as I said on at the conference, this is not basic SG&A and overhead consolidations as perhaps a lot of it was after the merger. This is more IT base, automation base process reengineering base is continued off-shoring of certain capabilities, where we have scale and et cetera. Okay it's not the same type of activities at this continued procurement, as we continue to gain scale in some areas, and we know how to do this. This is operations 101 or 102 and we're very confident we have visibility on that. Maybe one more question.
Erin Wright: Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Yeah, I think we're coming up on the hour, so I think if we just take one last question, please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger: Two questions, first, Ari, can you talk about the assets that you've bought so far this year, particularly in Q2? Sounds like that's mainly in R&D Solutions, but just sort of the nature of the assets you're buying. And the second question, I know you've talked about rolling out OCT I think later this year. As you think about that business over the next few years, is it - do you view it as a bigger opportunity than OCE or smaller just to frame it a little bit? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: On the acquisitions, I think we did very little acquisitions actually. We had a - I think we spent what - what was the number this quarter?$26 million I think we had one small little thing in technology and a tiny, tiny little thing in R&D. We had no acquisitions in R&D in the first quarter and in the second quarter like a small thing that added like a couple of million maybe something like that to our revenue, very small. In R&D, the acquisition contribution mostly came from last year in the I think I guess in the fourth quarter, we did an acquisition. And that acquisition did actually brought in a little bit more in the second quarter than we had anticipated. There another new contract that generated I think a little bit more revenue. But again, you're talking about single-digits here and then a very tiny, tiny acquisition that maybe brought in a couple of million, if I remember. So there is very, very little new news here on the R&D side and then technology is very small, so like really one, two little things.
Andrew Markwick: Yes, just a small company.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. And then the second question was..
John Kreger: The second question was your thinking on OCT, little bigger or smaller opportunity.
Ari Bousbib: So, look, it's a potentially huge market. It is not a market that's as well defined as the CRM market because the CRM market is a very mature market that has been there for decades. Used to be on-premise type old systems and with a CRM market for sales reps in pharma is a very old market. It was then revolutionized by one player, who introduced a SaaS solution that did extremely well and that continues, remains to be the leader in that market, but it's a very finite market. Okay, there's just a number of sales reps and that's it. There's no - it's a finite market and our growth in that market is simply market share grab. It's an OCE - OCE is a market share play against that large competitor. We just feel that competitor has like 80% plus market and we feel we are - we can claim a fair share of that market and that's what is actually happening on the back of superior capabilities that were obtained on the back of more investments in technology and our great partnership with sales force. With respect to OCT, its essentially about across the clinical suite of activities in a trial, deploying tools and technologies to automate processes that were previously paper-based and that included a lot of labor manipulations and prone to error, rework and the lot of inefficiency. So it's hard to quantify the size of the market, but I would say yes, the market is potentially much larger than OCE and a very attractive marketplace in terms of its growth patterns, because it's really converting the historically paper and labor intensive set of processes into more automated processes. And as you know the particularity of OCT is that it's - we would like to create automated tools that actually speak to each other and that are interconnected. That's how difference. There are many people who will bring in point solutions to the market. We are bringing in a suite of tools that can be turned on or off and that speak to each other and are interoperable and connected in a seamless suite, as we demonstrated at the investor conference and all of which are built on a sales force platform as well. Okay.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks for your question, John. Thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Jen and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have for the rest of the day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you kindly disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IQVIA First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference will be recorded, Wednesday, May 1, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with company’s business, which are discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings call. I’m pleased to report that the first quarter was another quarter of strong performance at IQVIA. We again reported results towards the high-end of our guidance range or above our guidance range for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Let’s review the numbers. First quarter revenue of $2,684 million, came in above our guidance range, resulting in constant currency revenue growth of 7.2%. On a segment perspective, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue grew 12.9% at constant currency, of which about 7% was organic. Strong performance was driven by solid double-digit growth in our real-world and technology businesses. R&D Solutions revenue grew 5.3% at constant currency, including over 300 basis points of headwind from pass-throughs. In the first quarter, we had a higher proportion of projects in the start-up phase, which typically have lower pass-throughs. Excluding pass-throughs, organic constant-currency growth was about 7.5%. Our Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was, as we had expected, down 7% at constant currency. We anticipate that this business will transition to growth in the second-half of the year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $587 million was towards the high-end of our guidance range and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53 was at the high-end of our guidance range and grew 14.2%. Let me provide an update on our businesses. Our tech team hosted over 300 clients IQVIA Technology Conference in Frankfurt a few weeks ago. The conference brought CIOs and technology leaders from across the industry together to network and experience the software innovations IQVIA is driving for life sciences in both the clinical and the commercial areas. We were pleased to welcome, Steve Guise, the CIO of Roche Pharma, who compellingly described why Roche made the decision to standardize on the IQVIA platform and how our solutions will help drive results. We are proud to partner with Roche in what so far has been a very smooth deployment. Our customers also heard from Theramex, a leading women’s health company that is growing rapidly and shows the IQVIA commercial suite in the mid-summer of 2018. Theramex’s continued growth was reliant on an efficient and successful implementation, and we were very pleased that they reported at the conference that the IQVIA solution is already operational in 20 countries, again, a smooth and efficient deployment in the field, led by IQVIA teams entirely. In addition to many other presentations from clients, the conference attendees also heard from our partners at Salesforce about the vision of building best-in-breed technology that spans the entire product life cycle and is tailored specifically to our life sciences clients needs. Our clients saw demonstrations of eTMF, RIM Smart, adverse events tracker, safety and pharmacovigilance, OCE analytics, and much more. They also witnessed firsthand the power of IQVIA AI and machine-learning capabilities fully integrated into this technology suite. Turning into real-world. The team continues to scale our capabilities in supporting single-arm trials. During the quarter, a top 10 pharma client obtained an FDA-approved license expansion for an oncology product. This was made possible through the use of our rich patient level analytical assets to form a real-world comparator arm in combination with our advanced AI capabilities. In fact, we now have over 150 studies in more than 20 countries, which utilize AI and machine-learning to drive better insights. During the quarter, we also announced the launch of E360 Genomics, our new patented technology platform, which will help advance research in the real-world space through the use of non-identified genomic data linked to rich patients analytics. This is a scalable, privacy preserving database solution, which provides an efficient way to conduct genomic research for the first time ever on the world’s largest pool of linked clinical whole genome sequence data. The R&D team had another strong quarter of net new business wins, continuing the momentum we saw accelerating through 2018. Bookings growth remains robust and our LTM net new business growth continues to hover around 30%, excluding pass-throughs. Our LTM contracted net book-to-bill ratio, again, excluding pass-throughs was 1.51. This is inclusive of the adjustment we made to our backlog. You should note, this is a record for the R&D team and the first time ever that the LTM net book-to-bill ratio, excluding pass-throughs, has exceeded 1.5, as we again had another quarter of very strong bookings. Now let me go off my prepared remarks here, because I heard, we had a couple of inbound this morning about our old good friend, the quarterly book-to-bill. So it was basically in the same range as the 1.5, we just talked about. And after the booking adjustment, it’s not that far behind, you can do the math. Now, sorry, it wasn’t 1.7 as the last two quarters, but it was well over the old 1.2 threshold that you guys like a lot before or after the adjustment. Now back to my prepared notes here, about the adjustment to backlog that we noted in our press release, we normally wouldn’t have removed the trial until the contractual arrangements have been finalized. Similarly, we don’t include, as you know, any award until contractual arrangements are finalized and report things on a contracted basis. However, we felt it appropriate to make an adjustment to backlog since the termination of this trial has been widely and publicly discussed. Due to the nature of the therapy area for this trial, the majority of revenue removed from backlog was pass-throughs, which as you know, has no impact whatsoever on adjusted EBITDA or adjusted diluted EPS. And by the way, the estimated impact of this adjustment is already reflected again in the record LTM book-to-bill number that I mentioned earlier. I’d like to further highlight that even net of this removal, the next 12 months revenue that we expect to convert from backlog actually further increased by over $100 million and currently stands at $4.9 billion. It is also noteworthy that we were able to fully absorb the backlog adjustment within our original 2019 revenue and profit guidance, which I think illustrates very well how the scale of our business, the breadth of our offerings and the continued momentum of our R&D business helps mitigate unexpected events such as a client ending a significant project. Now before I turn it over to Mike, I’d like to announce that we are scheduling an Analyst and Investor Day in New York City on June 18. We are planning a morning event running from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The focus will be on the long-term strategy of the business, in particular, we really looking forward to showcasing some of our technology. We want to make sure we convey the truly disruptive nature of the innovative solutions we are investing in and we are bringing to the marketplace and how that will be driving our growth well into the future. Please save the date, June 18. We hope you will be able to join us for this event. And now, I will hand it over to Mike.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As you’ve seen, we had another solid quarter. Let’s review some of the details. First quarter revenue of $2,684 million grew 4.7% reported and 7.2% at constant currency. First quarter Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,075 million grew 9.1% reported and 12.9% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $1,416 million grew 3.7% at actual FX rates and 5.3% at constant currency. R&D Services growth would be in the high-single digits, excluding the headwind from pass-throughs. As expected Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $193 million declined 9.4% reported and 7% at constant currency. Now, turning to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $587 million. First quarter GAAP net income was $58 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29. Adjusted net income was $309 million. First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.53. The improvement year-over-year was comprised of $0.15 from operating performance, plus $0.04 net from various puts and takes, including below the line items such as interest, operating D&A and taxes, as well as share buybacks. Let’s now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. As Ari mentioned, we continue to see strong bookings growth even after the adjustment to backlog. We also expect strong revenue conversion over the next 12 months from this backlog. And as we said before, we are fully absorbing the backlog adjustment in our 2019 guidance. Let’s review the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $936 million and debt was $11.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.4 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.6 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $113 million in the first quarter and free cash flow was negative $28 million. As is usual, during the first quarter, our free cash flow is lighter due to annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, cash flow this quarter was affected by the timing of various receipts and other disbursements, including our loyalty program business, which you may recall is our business that manages copay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Differences in the timing of payments we make to pharmacies as consumers use the programs versus reimbursement that we received from our pharma customers can cause meaningful swings in cash flow in any given quarter. CapEx was $141 million in the first quarter. This was somewhat higher than we have been accustomed to, as we continue to make investments in innovation to drive growth. We repurchased $141 million of our stock during the first quarter from certain of our remaining private equity sponsors. Let’s now turn to 2019 guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year 2019 revenue guidance of $10,900 million to $11,125 million. We are also affirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2,375 million to $2,425 million and our adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $6.20 to $6.40. Tax rates are still expected to be approximately 22% for the adjusted book tax rate and approximately 15% for the adjusted cash tax rate. This guidance assumes that foreign currency rate at March 31 remain in effect for the rest of the year. And by the way, I want to remind you that from the time we last provided guidance using January 1 FX rates until March 31, rates have actually moved against us. This has generated a revenue headwind for the company, but we are absorbing it within our revenue guidance range and our guidance remains unchanged. As in prior quarters, we are also providing guidance for the coming quarter. Again, assuming foreign currency remain – foreign currency remains at March 31 rate through the end of the second quarter, we expect revenues to be between $2,660 million and $2,710 million, adjusted EBITDA to be between $565 million and $580 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.46 and $1.51. This adjusted diluted EPS guidance represents year-over-year growth of 13.2% to 17.1%. In summary, we delivered first quarter results toward the high-end or above our guidance ranges. Total company revenue growth continued to accelerate. Organic revenue growth for the Technology & Analytics Solutions business continued to accelerate. Organic revenue growth for R&D Solutions continued to sustain high single-digit growth rates, excluding pass-throughs. R&D Solutions posted a record LTM contracted services net book-to-bill ratio of 1.51 times and NTM revenue from backlog conversion increased to $4.9 billion. We completed $141 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and we reaffirmed full-year revenue and profit guidance. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. Can you speak a little bit more about the nature of some of the new business wins in the quarter, the traction with large pharma versus biotech? And can you quantify how the NextGen is resonating with customers or translating into those new business wins we saw in the quarter, excluding, obviously, the cancellation and adjustment? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Hi, Erin, thanks for the question. Well, look, the – I know there has been some talks, maybe from others about what’s going on in the market. We see – we had very strong bookings growth across the Board. I’m looking here for the actual number, large pharma versus small pharma or biotech. We had bookings – overall gross awards were – gross bookings were 30% LTM. Can I have the large pharma and biotech numbers, so I can give some colors to Erin here? Okay, yes. Basically, strong growth across the Board. I do my – from memory here, because I don’t have the numbers probably LTM bookings growth, again 30%, large pharma bookings growth, which still represent the majority of our bookings Erin. The gross bookings in large pharma were up 30% and the EBP business wins grew over 20%. Our lot business was also strong. It was well over 20%. The pipeline is stronger this year than it was last year. The – we’re forecasting double-digit increase in RFP value here this year versus last year. We have, at the moment, the strongest pre-RFP qualified leads pipeline we ever had. It’s up double digits over this time last year. So we really see strength, frankly, across the Board. With respect to NextGen, we’ve not highlighted, because basically it continues to be as strong as it was. We had well over $600 million of, what we call now core enabled smart trial new business in the quarter. We now have somewhere around $4.5 billion of awards for our core enabled smart trials. We had actually some very nice awards in the quarter. We won a Phase III trial for diabetes, which was essentially driven by our ability to identify high-density patient sides. As you know, it’s a very researched area, diabetes and a lot of competition for patients. And we won on the basis of our ability to identifying target with a high degree of precision where those patients are in high-density sites. We also won a Phase II, Phase III trial for psoriasis. Again, entirely on the back of our ability to provide patient recruitment solutions that drove a reduction in the number of site required by 50% in this particular case. Again, our ability to target high-density of patient populations. So again, these awards always a good leading indicator for future contracted N&B. We continue to see very good strength and are happy with our quarter really across the segments.
Erin Wright: That’s very helpful. Thanks. And can you comment a little bit on the traction you’re seeing for the OCE offering? And is there a way you can kind of quantify how significant that is or will be to financials? Did it help to drive that strength in the technology segment in the quarter? And if there was any sort of more meaningful contribution from acquisitions within the technology segment, if you could break that out, that would be great? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So we – I think I said in my remarks that we had revenue growth of 12.9% in our Technology & Analytics Solutions segment and 7% of that was organic. That’s a very big number for us. You will remember that for the longest time, our underlying growth rates in that segment was 4%, which we’re happy with, but it accelerated to over 5%. Again, I’m talking about organic growth there in the fourth quarter and it was 7% this quarter. I’m not promising, it will continue to be at 7%, but certainly it has disconnected from the historic long time 4% level. Bear in mind, that about a third of our revenues in that business is data, is the old IMS data business and that business grows at 0%. So you really are talking about double-digit revenue growth for our real-world and technology itself, and it is driven by our new suite of products. We had a lot of success in the marketplace last year, since we launched OCE, and we also launched a number of other products, which we announced RIM Smart for regulatory and compliance [Multiple Speakers] to safety and covigilance. We launched OCE analytics, as an added functionality on OCE, which includes essentially a layer of artificial intelligence to add. We are more prescribe – prescribing insights to the users. Hopefully, you’ll get a chance to see all of that at our Investor Day on June 18.
Michael McDonnell: And I think on the OCE side, Erin, I think, we said last quarter, the team are actively engaged in over 100 active sales lead to still checking those down. So good market and compiling is very robust there and we’re seeing good traction in the marketplace.
Erin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Operator, can we take the next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys, and congrats. So maybe just sticking, Ari, I appreciate all the commentary on new bookings, but I’m just going to try to drive a point home here. I mean, it feels like from what we’ve seen from your peers so far, bookings have been, I don’t know, 1.15, 1.2 somewhere in that range from the peer group. The market – the investor base is sort of debating whether the market slowed down or not. It doesn’t feel that way to us. I guess, when I look at sort of your result, it feels like share is clearly changing hands in your favor. And it almost feels like on a sequential basis even with the cancellation and certainly, if you adjust for that, that pace is kind of accelerating. And so if you give us a feel – do you feel like the win rate is moving more in your direction? Do you feel like, particularly on the NextGen offering, that’s sort of reverberating even more exponentially within certain parts of the customer base, and just give us a feel for like the – that cadence that’s been now working for the last 18 months. It feels like that snowball just keeps growing more exponentially than literally, I guess, in terms of the your performance relative to the peer group?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, thanks – Ross, thanks for all those nice comments. I’d say, you’re right on your analysis here. The environment, I want to stress, continues to be very strong. We don’t see any slowdown. You’re actually – I’ll tell you, we are seeing an increase in the average value of our wins year-over-year. We see larger trials, bigger commitments. I mentioned to Erin earlier that the value of our RFP status trials in aggregate is up year-over-year double-digits. Again, strongest pre-RFP qualified leads pipeline, again, up double digits this time versus last time – last year this time. The future of clinical trials to the NextGen point and that is where the transformation is around digital health technologies use of real world data and application of AI. Now, all of these things can happen in a vacuum. You need the raw ingredients, which is the deep granular patient level analytics assets that we’ve spent decades building, and we’ve invested a lot in. And that was again to take you back 2.5 years ago the entire rationale for why we decided to do the merger at the time. We believe that as a result of all these investments, we are at the forefront of all of these and really leading the industry to change. Again, we hope to highlight how we’re doing these on June 18. With respect to the market itself, investment in medical innovation grew in 2018. We still see a lot of investment money flowing into the space. The value of the venture capital deals has more than doubled from the deal value in the last five years. If we took the top 15 largest pharmaceutical companies in aggregate, and by the way, this data is available in our IQVIA Institute Report, which was recently published analyzing in-depth the landscape of R&D, core innovation, drivers of change and evolution of clinical trial productivity. And if you don’t have that report, I strongly encourage. I’m sure it’s available on our website, or you can have Investor Relations. But the top 15 largest pharmaceutical companies in aggregate together upped their R&D spend by 30% in the last five years. In 2018, there was a record number of approvals and launches of innovative medicines. Biopharma is healthy. Of the 59 new drug launches in 2018, 38 were patented by EBP companies. Of the 26 new drugs registered with large pharma, half of them originated through the emerging biopharma. If you look at the number of molecules in late-stage development pipeline, it’s increased by 11%, which is almost 40% in the last five years. So we see a very strong environment. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter, you have ups and downs, and the numbers we posted reflect the strength of the environment, I just described and perhaps you were – perhaps, yes, some gains in share on the back of our more innovative solutions. Again we didn’t post 1.7 as we did the last two quarters, but it’s still very, very strong and certainly much higher than the numbers you reported the 1.15 to 1.20, you just quoted from competitors. Again, much higher than that pre or post adjustment.
Ross Muken: Perfect.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Ross Muken: And maybe a quick one for Mike. Can you just walk through kind of some of the noise in free cash in the quarter? It seemed like there were some disbursements here on loyalty and a few other pieces and just sort of how that will unwind over the balance of the year?
Michael McDonnell: So, Ross, happy to comment on that. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we pay our first quarter incentives or pay our annual incentives in the first quarter. So that always is a drag on cash flow and our first quarter is always our weakest cash flow quarter. So that was as expected. I think, in addition to that, I’d point you two things. One is, as I mentioned, the loyalty card program, which is one where there is just the timing between reimbursements that came in from our pharma clients versus when we have to pay those as coupons are presented. And so that, it’s just timing, but it can create a meaningful headwind or a tailwind to free cash flow. In this particular quarter, it was a bit of a – it was a meaningful headwind. And then lastly, our CapEx is a bit higher than what we’ve been accustomed to and we’re making some very good investments and some very attractive investments that we’re really happy with and we think we’re going to bear fruit longer-term. And those are really the key points. I’d remind you that we continue to benefit from a very low-cost of debt. Continue to be very tax-efficient. We’re pleased with our share buyback program and we continue to expect that over time, our free cash flow should be kind of a $900 million to $1 billion a year sort of number.
Ross Muken: Helpful. Thanks, Mike.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Ari, maybe just starting with the pass-throughs, can you maybe comment on how much of that was related to BIB [ph] and why is it generally higher for Alzheimer’s and other areas? And then as we think about the revenue dynamics associated with the Biogen wind down, can you maybe just talk about how you think about it impacting R&D Solutions for the remainder of the year?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. So pass-throughs in general is, we are a year into this new standard. We’re still trying to – we – hopefully, we’re getting a better handle on it, but it’s just much harder to predict the timing of pass-throughs by definition just at the booking stage already. It’s – you can have very strong, it’s a very precise analysis of what the bookings number is for service revenue, but the pass-through is more of an estimate. So not saying that there’s going to be a big variation, but it’s not as precise as service – as expected service revenues already at the booking stage. Then the – this time that we recognize revenue on an estimate of completion basis, again, it’s complex exercise to estimate what remains to be done on a project and evaluate the timing on how that’s going to be done in relationship to what has already accomplished. But that’s a complex exercise for the actual work, for the labor that goes into the work, but the pass-throughs, it’s even harder, right? And so that causes some lumpiness into when they come in quarter-in, quarter-out. Bear in mind that to make things even more complicated, depending on the mix of projects, you could have business lines and therapy areas that have varying levels of pass-throughs. In this particular – in the case of the project that we just highlighted that was terminated, it’s in the therapy area that happens to require an enormous amount of, how do I say it without saying word therapy, but all of them arise, a lot of scans, PET scans, a lot of very expensive procedures in the course of the trial. That’s very highly specific to this therapy area. And as a result, it ends up being a huge amount in relationship to the service revenue, in fact, the majority. That’s highly unusual. If you look at our backlog, it’s actually more, 70%, 30%, right? 70% services, 30% pass-through and that’s much more representative of what a typical clinical trial will look like 70%, 30%. This is highly, highly unusual to our disproportionate philosophies. Also bear in mind, the nature of the work, if it is functional, if it’s FSP work, then there is no pass-throughs, virtually no pass-throughs, lab work has little pass-throughs, data safety science and regulatory have really good pass-throughs, but other full clinical work does have a lot of pass-throughs. And finally, depending on where are you in your -- you could show very high revenue in a quarter driven almost entirely by pass-through as you can see from maybe other reporting peers and that’s because it means that they are arriving towards the end or they closing out projects. If on the other hand, you stand at the cusp of executing a very large backlog as is the case for us, because we have a lot of wins over the past few quarters, then in early stages of a project, you have much less pass-through. So that’s kind of – to give you some color on this pass-through thing, which again, I think, it’s not an easy piece of the business to understand. We’re becoming more – we’re trying to become more precise about it. And we’ve highlighted whenever that lumpiness causes some unusual swings in our revenues and that’s what we try to do this call.
Tycho Peterson: And in terms of the revenue dynamics associated with the Biogen wind down, I know in the past you’ve talked about there is a long process here that can take sometime. Was there any kind of one-off revenue recognition benefits related to this in 1Q within R&D Solutions?
Ari Bousbib: No.
Tycho Peterson: …and how should we think about this for the remaining of the year?
Ari Bousbib: No, no, no. The answer is no. There was nothing – first of all, it happened towards the end of the quarter. There was nothing and we’re still figuring – we’re still working with them with that client on the wind down. But we figure to be conservative and just make an estimate and just take it out entirely of the backlog and just to reset. Frankly, when it was announced and we thought – we kind of focused internally, and so should we just take it out of the back of – right now, we issued a press release. But frankly, it’s immaterial when – to our numbers. That was our conclusion and we were told, there’s no reason to do anything until. And so we waited for the first opportunity, which is the earnings release. And despite all of that, again, I just want to point out that in the next 12 months, revenue expected from the existing backlog that – which I think, we think is the most indicative metric is up $100 million versus sequentially. I think it’s up $300 million or more than $300 million year-over-year and continues to grow. So to us, that’s the most significant – and that’s again, after we removed that trial. We – again we – of that trial, what we’ve moved essentially was going to come into revenue over the next two, three years, right? It’s about two, three years of revenue for the vast majority of that – of that dollar number. I mean, if you go back two years to – and you’re right. If you go back to Q4 of 2017, end of 2017, we were at NTM revenue from backlog of 4.5. So we have $400 million versus that. And we were at 4.6 for a while throughout 2018, we jumped to 4.8 last quarter, and we now at 4.9. Again, after the reduction – the elimination of that trial. Thank you.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then – okay, thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks, operator. Can we take our next question, please?
Operator: Of course. We’ll go to the next question from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger: Hi, thanks. Two quick ones. Ari, you’ve mentioned AI and machine learning a few times on the call. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on how you’re using that technology for clinical trials? And then the second, given the low unemployment rates, particularly in the US, are you having any issues staffing up to manage the growth you’ve been reporting? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So on clinical trials, obviously, we’ll be talking about NextGen for a while, but the idea here is to do simulation and to model out. What this trial really look like based on the data assets, on the analytics, the technology and the vast amount of computing capabilities that we brought together. So the objective is to eliminate or reduce protocol amendments, accelerate the by patient recruitment, targeting the right size, including size that we’re not previously necessarily known as research size, developing new investigation – investigators. Automation, in general, has been key to gaining scale to our core enabled next generation smart trials. We can generate predictive analytics in minutes, as opposed to weeks, if you are doing it by trial and error as it’s used to be done in the past. We now have analytical libraries that drive these automated analytics and that can be used essentially off the shelf. I think we have over 1,000 automated analytics. It covers like over a – about 100 indications. And this year, I think, we plan to essentially cover 25 countries. So, today, we have more than 500 smart trials already in operation, and that represents about a third of the total trials that we are conducting. And we expect that within the next two, three years, the vast majority of the trials will be using these capabilities. So again, it’s all about speed to market for our clients, accelerating the trials, eliminating efficiency, rework, waste, and our technology capabilities enable that.
John Kreger: Great, thank you. And then the other question was about labor. Are you seeing any cost pressures and hiring difficulties? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, we have a large backlog to execute. And so, naturally, we are cognizant of the fact that the – we need those talented resources, but we do have 58 people and we work very hard on increasing productivity. You heard us before talk about mobiles, mobile solutions for CRAs, more automated capabilities for pieces of the world that can be automated. A lot of the solutions we talk about for our clients, we also are working to apply them internally. Now there are areas, I agree with you, where, for example, data scientists and the technology, the deployment of our OCE wins, which for the most part, we do ourselves contrary to other competitors. We have great talent and so far, the large ones that we’ve done, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, have been very, very successful. We – that’s expensive resources and you’re right. There is some level of waste deflation, no question about that.
John Kreger: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. Just looking at the conversion, pretty steady quarter-over-quarter in this quarter. But based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you guys expect strong revenue conversion over the next 12 months. So just curious I know there’s a lot of dynamics at play there. But just curious, how much line of sight, what the driving factors are that give you confidence that the conversion should pick up as we move over the next year?
Ari Bousbib: Well, I think, you’re correct. The math in the quarter, that’s what, if you look – that’s what it is pretty stable. Our bookings have been fairly outsized compared to recent history. And so obviously, the burn rate, it causes the burn rate. In individual projects, especially the ones using our new smart innovations and technology, we see an acceleration of the burn. Without that, you might have seen a decline in the burn rate, simply because of how much stronger the bookings have been. They want – when you add, especially when you add a lot of bookings, they’re not going to convert to revenue in the quarter following contracting. It’s going to take sometime. And so and hopefully, we will continue to add more and more. So you will always have that kind of a headwind, if you will, which is important, a good one in this case. We do want to add stronger and stronger bookings every quarter. But the fact is, when you do that and they don’t convert, so you cannot create in aggregate a headwind to conversion. And it masks the actual increase in burn rate that we see in the projects that we are executing. So now, we build our revenue forecast project by project and calculate total cost incurred as a percentage of the total estimated cost, and that’s the basis for revenue recognition. And, of course, we update this calculation forecast on a monthly basis, that’s the new 606 standard. So to help you with the modeling, we provide you, as you just quoted, the closing backlog, the next 12 months revenue from backlog, and we also provide you with quarterly and annual guidance. So again, as I tried to explain before, the backlog includes pass-throughs and at times the burn on the pass-through can actually be slower than the burn on the service revenue. So it is possible you will see a slower burn on pass-through backlog following a period of stronger net new business, because again, pass-through are usually incurred at later stages in the product life cycle. So on a very, very large backlog over $17 billion like ours, it’s hard to see the – all the puts and takes inside. So we feel actually very good that the burn rate remains where it is given everything I just told you.
Robert Jones: That’s helpful, Ari. If I could just ask one on TAS as well. Obviously, you highlighted the strong organic growth in that segment. But obviously, quite a bit of growth from M&A also helping out that segment. But just curious if you could talk a little bit about what types of deals you guys are executing in the TAS segment, how big and small are these assets? And then how does the M&A landscape look going forward as far as other bolt-ons and tuck-ins you can do in that business?
Ari Bousbib: Right. Well, again, TAS was 12.9% all-in 7% means no acquisition in the 7%. That’s – so the acquisitions were essentially as always small bolt-on technology applications that we like that complement our suite, that help us bring capability. Sometimes honestly, we buy companies for the pool of talents. We just bring them in and they help us change the culture, they bring in capabilities that we don’t have. It would be very, very hard to go out and recruit people from like that individually. We bring in teams. We’ve done acquisitions recently included in these 4.9 points of the [indiscernible], those include some in the safety space, regulatory space. These are areas where we’re not present. So we are expanding the suite of capabilities that we are offering our clients. Again, we recall our strategy there. We will say more about that on June 18, but our strategy is to build a fully integrated suite of applications that are seamlessly integrated in our all leverage the same analytics and information assets across the Board. Thank you. We can take another…
Andrew Markwick: I think we have time for probably three more questions, operator.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Ari, I wanted to use your discussion. I appreciate your discussion about your management of the client relationship in the cancellation and use that as a way to explore your kind of walking into guidance for this year. It was my sense that in the second-half of 2018, you were quite careful about getting too aggressive about 2019. And only after the second quarter of really large bookings, did you kind of step up the expected growth rate, which I thought, it seemed was prudently cautious. And I’m wondering if you kind of knew that this study was in a risky therapeutic area, had a protocol written to have an interim look and was something that you wanted to be certain you could absorb as you moved into 2019, if, in fact, this were the outcome. Can I give you that much credit?
Ari Bousbib: I wish you were right. I – no one, no one, absolutely any idea that this study will be terminated. I might eventually tell you that the client themselves had no idea the day before, okay? So this is not the way it happens. You don’t – you probably don’t need me to tell you how these things happen. They have independent third-party reviewers. It’s a very scientifically sound process, the company itself does not make that decision. So no one knew. I mean, this is – look, this is – we all know, which trial we’re talking about. This is – this was devastating news for the industry, for the people, who have been dedicated their lives to try to find a solution to this terrible disease and most of all for the patients that’ll have very high hopes. I mean, you’re talking about real serious traumatized employees certainly at the client, but – and then even for us with need for a strong emotional support. So no one expected any of this. Now were we conservative – more conservative in early 2018? Yes, because, look, we tried to be – we’ve said it before, we try to under promise and over deliver and we hope that we will always be in that position. And I think I did say last quarter that my inclination normally would be to – we tried every possible way, not to be as excited as perhaps we were on our calls, but, look, we continue to be to feel very good. Environment again is strong. We were able to fully absorb this, because we looked at the numbers and looked where we are and we looked at this when that termination was announced, not we didn’t know before at all. As I said before, we actually had several meetings here internally. I can’t reveal up to you by asking all the right – all the questions, I think, I’m supposed to ask from our experts, legal, financial, control, audit, no is there a material event here? Do we need to do anything? Is there anything to change? We did all the reviews internally that you would expect us to do and we concluded? No. There is nothing happened. Nothing happened. We’re okay. I think, again, is we are a large company. We have scale. We have wide diversity of offerings. We have a lot of clients across the Board, nothing here. So, again, another company that would probably be smaller, even marginally smaller that will be less diversified, that will be perhaps more concentrated from a client standpoint, would have a very, very hard time overcoming such a large termination. But for us, we feel comfortable that this is within our range of guidance and that’s okay, things happen.
David Windley: And would it be – sorry.
Andrew Markwick: I want to try and squeeze in one more question if possible from another analyst, if possible. Thank you, Dave.
David Windley: Sure. If I could just ask a numerical one, would it be possible to give the trailing 12-month bookings dollars number as you have in the prior press releases, that would be great? I’d appreciate it. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: We’ll have that from the follow-up.
Andrew Markwick: Yes, I think, we – let’s follow-up on that offline. I’d like to try and jump to another question, if we can.
David Windley: Okay. Yes, sure. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much. I actually like Dave’s question. So I’ll ask that one too and we’ll do it offline. So on this – on this $390 million cancel admittedly, I think, bigger than a lot of us thought, largely because of the pass-through side of it. But did you specifically say, and I’ve been on and off with other things this morning, did you specifically say how much of that will impact your revenue in 2019 and 2020? It’s the first component of my question. The second component…
Ari Bousbib: Yes.
Eric Coldwell: Go ahead.
Ari Bousbib: No, go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. Second component and this all sort of ties together. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your overall study mix, I think, skews to earlier stage projects, which, of course, in the new 606 world means lower percentage of completion, because reimbursables pass-throughs are later stage in trials. You’re actually probably under representing in your numbers today what your revenue growth could be or would be in a more normal world. When do you think these early stage project start to – when will they mature? When will you be coming back to us and saying, now we’re hitting the sweet spot of revenue recognition on that book of business? So I’m just – I’m trying to triangulate when we’re going to see overall revenue growth in R&D as frankly, I think, it’s going to be pretty high in the next year or two, but I’m just trying to get a sense on when the timing of all of this plays out?
Ari Bousbib: Okay. On the first part of your question, I did not say how much revenue either in 2019 or 2020 or 2021 is – will be taken out from our internal forecasts as a result of that termination, because we feel that they are not material. That change is not material to the guidance ranges that we provided, it’s within our ranges. This is why we decided that it does not – we are not making any changes whatsoever to any of the numbers we provided to you before we knew of this cancellation. So the answer is no, there’s no – nothing. It’s behind us and we are moving on. Second, following question is, yes, you are right. It typically tends to ramp up and accelerate in terms of revenue recognition as the project goes on. The start-up phase can be – it does not bring in as much revenue. And the sweet spot is generally in the one, two, three years after – one, two, three years after the project – the trial started. But I mean, you’re familiar with those dynamics as well. And you’re right also on the pass-throughs that’s typically, they tend to come in later on in the second-half of the trial. Okay.
Eric Coldwell: Maybe I didn’t ask it specifically enough. I’m curious if you can tell us based on the aging of your overall book when you would say, you’re at a quote normal level of aging. Is that one year out, six quarters out, two quarters out, I’m just not sure if you have that kind of visibility, if you can share that with us, but…
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I can tell you. Look, first of all in second-half of 2017 and first-half of 2018, we had very strong bookings. In the second-half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, we had hugely strong books. So we’re still – we are – I can’t give you a precise number when there is a sweet spot. And there is – my sweet spot keeps going further and further. In other words, I’m not looking at this as a curve that speaking at some point in time, then going down. I’m looking at it as a curve that’s going up well into the future and accelerating in terms of the slope of that curve, okay, if I’ve been clear. So I don’t have a peak here in front of me, okay? So that’s my – I think you asked about the LTM, N&B. It’s kind of – I did mention. I don’t know if I answered your question correctly. But I did mention in my prepared remarks, it’s up 30% in terms of the growth. And basically, it’s – you wanted the number, right? What was the question [Multiple Speakers]
Michael McDonnell: $6 billion.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, it’s around $6 billion or a little bit over that. I mean, that’s where the number is and we will clarify that in post-call conversations. Thank you very much.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you very much, Ari.
A - Andrew Markwick: Thanks very much, Ari. Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2019 earnings call. And as always, Jen and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have for the rest of the day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, February 14, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Alison. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. Also here with us today is a new member of the Investor Relations team Jennifer Halchak, who just joined IQVIA Senior Director, Investor Relations. Jen has over 20 years of experience, working in the capital markets with extensive experience in IR. We are excited about Jen, joining the team and I know she is looking forward to working with all of you. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements, due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards, which are discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. We will review how we closed 2018 and provide financial guidance for 2019. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, capping a year of consistent solid operating performance at IQVIA. Once again, we reported results at the high end or above our financial targets. Let's review the numbers. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.688 billion came in above our guidance range, resulting constant currency revenue growth of 8.1%. Relative to the midpoint of our guidance range, over half of the revenue beat was driven by an acceleration of our organic growth rates in both the R&D and technology and analytics segments, and a little less than a half was driven by the higher than expected pass-through revenue, associated with this organic growth. From a segment perspective. Technology and analytics solutions revenue grew 10.9%, at constant currency. On an organic constant currency basis, growth was over 5%. You will note this growth rate represents a significant acceleration of our historical consistent 4% organic growth in this segment. We expect this momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond. This strong organic growth performance was driven by solid double-digit growth in our real world business and higher than expected year-end demand for our other commercial offerings. Also during the quarter, we marked the anniversary of several tech-businesses we have acquired in 2017. Which is why the contribution from an M&A has tempered sequentially. R&D solutions revenue grew 8.7% at constant currency, of which 8% was organic. You will note the strong organic constant currency growth in the quarter represents a significant acceleration of our R&D growth rate, which was 4.5% through the end of the third quarter. The strong organic growth performance in our R&D business reflects the early signs of revenue acceleration in these segments. With growth resulting from the team winning new business, at an extremely high rate and our unique core enabled approach to the business, helping to execute parts of our existing book of business, at a faster pace than we had expected. This in turn has brought pass-through revenue in at a faster rate than we had originally anticipated, which also contributed to the acceleration of growth. Fourth quarter, contract sales and medical solutions revenue was down about 9% at constant currency. We are seeing the early signs of stabilization and turnaround in this business, as the decline had been 13% through the end of the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $583 million was at the high end of our guidance range and grew 9.7% at constant currency. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 was also at the high end of our guidance range and grew 23%. Versus the midpoint of our guidance range, the beat for both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS was entirely driven by our stronger than expected operational performance. I would like to take a minute and recap some of our key accomplishments during 2018, which will help drive growth in 2019 and beyond. In technology, we made significant progress with our Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE platform, our CRM Smart product. Since we launched OCE in December 2017, we have, had over 30 competitive wins, including previously announced contracts with Roche and Novo Nordisk. we have more than 30,000 users going to live on the platform and the tool is currently being deployed in over 100 countries. With a solid pipeline of opportunities the team is currently engaged in over 100 active sales leads. As you know, OCE is powered by Force.com and we announced the expansion of our sales force partnership, as we aim to build an integrated suite of clinical technology on the Health Cloud platform. For, example. We have built our Virtual Trial platform Study Hub, which is already live in the market on Health Cloud. We see increasing levels of sponsor interest, as we leverage this transformative technology to bring clinical research directly to patients, ultimately increasing participation as we help clients, reach diverse and difficult to recruit patients. You may have also seen our recent press releases for our regulatory and safety platform, also build on Health Cloud, which we go live in the first half of 2019. As the team builds on the success of our OCE platform, stay tuned for further updates in the clinical technology space. In real world, we closed the year with solid double-digit organic revenue growth contrary to what is standard in the CRO industry, we do not report our real world numbers together with our clinical development numbers. So unlike our peers, real world business growth is not included in our R&D Solutions business growth. The team has had significant success in 2018 and continues to shape the industry by infusing data smartly into research. For example, the team has a number of wins for single-arm study during 2018. You will recall, this is an innovative approach, where we use a real world data arm to benchmark the results of the clients single-arm study. We also signed an important collaboration with Genomics England, that will make the world's largest pool of linked clinical whole-genome sequence data available for research. As you all know, when people speak about genomic data, such as commercial companies that analyze your DNA, they usually have snippets or a partial genomic sequence. The focus of Genomics England is that the sequence, whole genomes and they link this to the patient's complete clinical record, which creates a much more expensive granular data. Alongside our novel genomic de-identification approach and E360 machine learning analytics platform, this will accelerate faster and more efficient drug research and greater access to personalized medicine. Across the board, the real world team has continued to scale our overall real world business, by employing novel and scalable technology to unique data sets. We now received over 70 billion healthcare records annually, resulting in data sets on over 600 million non-identified patients globally. R&D solutions, had a very strong year of new business wins. We closed 2018 with another record quarter of contracted bookings. Our fourth quarter contracted net new business, excluding pass-through was $1.7 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.7 for the quarter. Bookings growth was over 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. And the good news is that the R&D bookings engine is firing on all cylinders. We saw strength across all segments. If you look at this from a customer segment perspective, large pharma bookings growth, which still represents the majority of our bookings grew 20%. EBP bookings grew over 50%. From a product offering segment perspective, we saw particular strength in full clinical, which comprise the bulk of our bookings. It continued to accelerate with bookings growth of over 60% in the quarter. The lab was also strong, with bookings growth of over 30%. The functional service provider business, which as you know, we are still trying to make a comeback in, is still not where we need to be and it's still a small part of our overall bookings. R&D Solutions, full-year contracted net new business was $5.85 billion, representing year-over-year growth of over 29%. We now have over $17 billion of R&D Solutions backlog when you include pass-through. The strategic rationale for our merger is increasingly proving itself in the marketplace. As we exited 2018, we applied our core enabled smart offering to over 60% of the R&D sales pipeline, resulting in the next generation of clinical development team having yet another strong quarter of gross new business awards of over $800 million, which excludes pass-through associated with this revenue. The large pharma represents an increasing proportion of our core enabled Smart Trial bookings. It has gone from less than 20%, when we introduced this differentiated offering to about 60% for our pharma this quarter. Automation has been key to gaining scale for our core enabled next generation smart trials. We can now generate analytics in minutes, as supposed to weeks. The team has built analytical libraries to drive automated analytics that can be used of the shelf. In total, we have over 1,000 automated analytics, covering nearly 100 indications that we plan to use in over 25 countries in 2019. Today we have 500 smart trials in operation, representing one-third of our total trials in operation. And this 500 trials alone, has more than 90,000 patients to be enrolled at about 20,000 sites. In fact, over 70% of the patient recruitment for these next generation smart trials, will take place outside of the United States. Once again, underlying the power of our global capabilities. Additionally, and consistent with our new post-merger, go-to-market strategy which we call, see more, win more. We have seen through 2018, RFP volume in general, increase more than 30% and we won business with more than 300 new clients in the clinical space during the year. Importantly, we won significant contracts with five large pharma accounts that the R&D team has not done business with in many years. We are clearly seeing more and we are winning more. Our sponsors come to realize the benefits of our highly differentiated capabilities. Now, we closed 2018 on a strong note, and as we look to 2019, the markets we address remains healthy. The Life Science industry is expected to grow mid-single digits over the next five years. R&D activities at an all-time high and the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to grow, with the late-stage pipeline growing 10% in 2018. The FDA approved 59 drugs in 2018 up from 46 in 2016. The IQVIA institutes, estimate that 270 new molecular entities will be launched over the next five years, up 17% compared to the last five years. The FDA continues to support innovative approaches to clinical development, specifically the use of data, analytics and technology to accelerate clinical development and reduce regulatory risk. In fact, recent announcements from the FDA continue to support the use of secondary data in the real-world space. And finally, commentary from our client base remains healthy. Pharma is bullish on the science, innovative research and current clinical research programs. Our clients continue to drive SG&A efficiencies, through increased commercial outsourcing to allow for growth in R&D funding. Our clients also acknowledge that pricing is under scrutiny on the commercial side, but it currently don't anticipate this to become a major disruptor to their clinical development initiatives. Taking together, it's clear, this is a very compelling backdrop for the industry and IQVIA is better positioned than ever to capitalize on these dynamics. And with that let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer.
Mike McDonnell: Thank you Ari and good morning everyone. As you have seen, we closed the year with strong fourth quarter financials and would now review the details. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.688 billion grew 6.6% reported and 8.1% at constant currency. Full-year revenue of $10.412 billion grew 7.3% reported and 6.8% at constant currency. Fourth quarter, technology and analytics solutions revenue of $1.127 billion grew 8.8% reported and 10.9% at constant currency. Technology and analytics solutions full-year revenue of $4.137 billion, grew 12.4% reported and 12.1% at constant currency. R&D solutions revenue of $1.368 billion, grew 7.8% at actual FX rates and 8.7% at constant currency. Full-year, R&D solutions revenue of $5.465 billion grew 7.1% at actual FX rates and 6.5% at constant currency. Contract sales and medical solutions revenue of $193 million declined 10.6% reported and 8.8% at constant currency. Contract sales and medical solutions, Full-year revenue of $810 million declined 11.5% at actual FX rates and 12.2% at constant currency. Turning now to profit. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $583 million, grew 10.8% reported and 9.7% at constant currency. Full-year adjusted EBITDA of $2.224 billion, grew 10.6% reported and 9.9% at constant currency, resulting in 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 60 basis points on both a reported and constant currency basis. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $69 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income of $307 million grew 17.6% in the fourth quarter. Growth was primarily driven by stronger adjusted EBITDA and tax efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher D&A and interest expense. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.50 grew 23%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher adjusted net income, which I just discussed, as well as the lower share count year-over-year. 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.55 grew 22%. We had another record quarter of bookings in our R&D solutions business. Let's review net new business and backlog. Contracted net new business, excluding pass-through for the full-year of 2018 was $5.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 28.9%, a record for the R&D solutions team. Backlog grew almost 15% in 2018 and now stands at $17.130 billion. As a reminder, we report backlog including pass-through. We were pleased to see an acceleration of over $200 million in our next 12 months revenue from backlog during the quarter, which results in 2019 revenue visibility of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2018. Now let's review the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $891 million and debt was $11 billion, resulting in net debt of about $10.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.5 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $417 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $138 million and free cash flow was $279 million. We repurchased $604 million of our stock during the quarter, including $247 million from our private equity sponsors in December. As a result , our remaining private equity ownership is now about 10% of our total shares outstanding. We executed $1.4 billion of repurchases during 2018 and since the merger, we have completed $5 billion of share repurchases, at an average price of $89.11. Yesterday, our Board approved an increase of the share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, leaving with us with a remaining authorization of approximately $2.3 billion. Let's now turn to 2019 guidance. Our Full-year 2019 revenue guidance is 10.900 billion to $11.125 billion. This guidance assumes a headwind from foreign currency of 110 basis points, based on foreign currency rates in effect at the beginning of the year. It is worth noting that since then, some key currencies have moved against us . So as we sit here today, the FX headwind has increased by approximately $20 million in relation to these key currencies. For full-year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.375 billion and $2.425 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.40. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $425 million. Operational depreciation and amortization of approximately $325 million, other below the line expense items, such as minority interest of approximately $30 million and a continuation of our share repurchase activity. Tax rates are expected to be approximately 22% for the adjusted book tax rate and approximately 15% for the adjusted cash tax rate. Again, this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates at the beginning of the year remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now, we are excited to see an acceleration of revenue growth in our R&D solutions and technology and analytics solutions businesses, as well as the stabilization in our CSMS business. Let's review our 2019 revenue guidance in a bit more detail. We currently expect technology and analytics solutions revenue to be between $4.350 billion and $4.425 billion, representing growth of 6.7% to 8.6% on a constant currency basis. R&D solutions revenue is expected to be between $5.750 billion and $5.900 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8.8% on a constant currency basis. CSMS revenue is expected to be about $800 million, representing flattish growth on a constant currency basis. You should note CSMS, is expected to transition to growth during the year. For the total company, 2019 constant currency revenue growth is expected to be 5.8% to 7.9%, which includes acquisition contribution to growth of a little more than 100 basis points, this contribution is split approximately two-thirds in technology and analytics solutions and one-third in R&D Solutions. Recall at the time of the merger, we told you that total company revenue growth would be 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher, exiting the third year of our merger integration. Now as we enter the third year of our merger integration, we are already there. Specifically we are encouraged by the acceleration of our R&D solutions business, which has been driven by the team winning a greater number of opportunities, earlier than expected and our Smart clinical trial capabilities enabling execution at a faster pace. Let me now provide you with some color on the first quarter of 2019. Assuming FX rates at January 1st, remained constant through the end of the quarter. We expect revenue to be between $2.630 billion and $2.680 billion, reflecting a headwind from FX of almost 300 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA to be between $575 million and $590 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.48 and $1.53 reflecting growth of 10.4% to 14.2%. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results. R&D solutions LTM contracted services net new business grew about 29%. Our next generation of clinical development team secured over $800 million of awards for our differentiated offerings, bringing full-year 2018 awards to $2.5 billion or $3.7 billion, since we closed the merger. We are delivering earlier than expected on our merger promise to accelerate revenue growth in our R&D and technology and analytics businesses. 2018 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points above the constant currency and reported basis. We executed $604 million of share repurchase in the quarter, bringing the total post-merger repurchase to $5 billion at an average price of $89.11 and the Board has just authorized us to expand our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. And with that...
Ari Bousbib: Hang on a second Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I just want to say that how incredibly proud I am of the year - of the team for really a super performance in 2018. Everyone worked very, very hard to deliver performance we can all be proud of. Frankly, it feels really good to look back at where we were just a couple years ago, after closing our merger. You were all there and recall those beginnings. And at the beginning of that journey, we set out to execute a three-year plan to accelerate revenue growth, exiting the third year of the merger by 100 basis points to 200 basis points to expand our margins throughout $200 million cost synergy target and other productivity improvements and to grow our adjusted diluted EPS by double-digits and of course execute on a capital allocation strategy, which included strategic M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. And here we are just two years after the merger, we are already looking at top-line acceleration - at the top line acceleration that we were looking for. And we are well on our path to finalizing to $200 million of cost synergies. So again, I want to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their hard work and their collective contribution. You have take IQVIA to really new heights and I look forward to continuing this journey with you as our momentum continues to build and now okay, to get back to the program and I guess, open up for questions.
Mike McDonnell: Yes. I think we will take our first question, please, operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tycho Peterson: Thanks, congrats on the quarter. Ari, just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on the healthy bookings and B2B. And you know, it seems like a lot more commentary on your part on this call about executing at a faster pace and some of the pass-through revenues helping also contract sales and medical. So, if you could touch on those two dynamics as well that would be helpful.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, well, we try to give you a little bit more color. We heard the questions on our bookings growth and so on. So we wanted to provide as much data as we could and hopefully that will help the understanding that we are really growing our business at a really unexpected pace. With respect to your question on executing our book-of-business faster, with our NextGen capabilities. You know, people are focused on the burn rate in aggregate, but it's really a very high level metric because we are booking at a much higher rate. It's very difficult to see that we actually accelerating revenue growth in the trials that actually use the Smart Trial NextGen capabilities. On specific trials, we see it. And absent that, you would see an aggregate burn rate goes down mathematically because of the very large volume of bookings that we bringing in at one time. But in fact, we know, that we are accelerating revenue recognition through executing faster on the trials, where we deploy the technology. And as a result of that, since we are - we changed the accounting method and now have to report pass-through and service revenues as one-line. Because we are executing faster than we bringing in pass-through, we recognize pass-through revenue faster as well. And That is also part of why the revenue growth was higher than we had anticipated. But really, it's across the board. I think, as I mentioned mostly on the full clinical side, the bookings have been extremely strong, as the strong and large pharma, which is still, the majority of our bookings, strong on EBP as well. FSP is a bit weaker, as you know, the company have been kind of distancing itself from lower margin FSP work. Before the merger, we declared that we intend to come back in this segment and we are making some progress. But obviously it's still a small part of our bookings and we are not there yet. And - but again, according to our bookings it has been outstanding.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then for the follow-up, can you just talk a little bit more about the drivers that underpin your confidence in CSMS transitioning back to growth this year. What gives you [indiscernible]?
Ari Bousbib: So we said, we gave guidance for flat revenue. But during the year we transition to growth sometime in the year. That is where the plan is built. The business was organized essentially and separately, and we thought it was very inefficient, you know, that we had kind of a heartache on this business, didn't quite know what to make of it. We decided in 2018 that we were going to align it with our operating structure regionally. We are taking a much more local approach with our regional business unit, selling the offering along with the rest of our commercial offerings. That is where the client relationships are stronger for this type of work. And operating in this more decentralized will puts us closer to decision makers in the field. We also have a better opportunity to partner with the client and use some of the technology and analytics solutions offerings in the sale process. So overall, we see positive outlook for the business in 2019 and beyond, in a way that we haven't had in many years. As you know, the business has been declining double digits. So Yes, thank you.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks operator. You can take on next question please.
Operator: The next question comes line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed.
Ross Muken: Thanks Ari, for all the color. I guess maybe first, it seems like, and you highlighted the OCE offering is sort of accelerated to a degree where you are getting a ton of customer traction here, and that obviously has pretty material sort of long-term implications for the growth rate of the technology business. I guess, as you think about sort of the scope of where you are in that launch and sort of the investments you are making now and then eventually what that will allow you to do on maybe the operating line in that business. I guess, how do you think about sort of what that does to the sustainability of this maybe elevated growth rate we are seeing in technology and then remind us maybe on the margin cadence for that piece. We get sort of some of the cost now that the long-term margin profile of that sales should be quite attractive?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, Ross, thanks for your comments. Yes, That is absolutely correct. The long-term attractiveness of this business is undeniable margin expansion once the technology is deployed and it's essentially SaaS license revenue, which is high margin revenue. The initial phases are - you know, deployment and implementation can be costly. So, this is not a margin business, it's a lot of labor content involved. We do most of our implementation ourselves. As you know, won some very large contracts, it's unprecedented in our organization. We mentioned the Roche deal, which is really big, it's a very big number. And so in the initial stages, That is very much a margin headwind. But it is an investment for us and it generates superior growth. And long-term, these are higher margins, as you point out, and I would add, they are sustainable, long-term margin. It's very, very hard to dislodge incumbents in technology, which is why it's been a struggle in this area. In the CRM, as you know, there is a very large dominant player who's been very, very good and it's been essentially unimpeded. And we are making a comeback and we are trying to claim our fair share. But the fact is once you are in - the switching costs are very high, which is why - this is an attractive business and why embedding technology in everything we do is a fundamental strategy of ours. We want to be partners for the very long-term with our clients and we want them to value the partnership and technology builds sustainable partnership possibility with our clients for the very long-term.
Ross Muken: Thanks for that. And maybe just going back to the R&D business. Yes, obviously you have done much better on the Biotech side and you have taken a mass amount share there, off of a low base. But it feels like, in general, the momentum in the business even the base pharma business continues to build. I guess as you think about sort of where you are taking the share from and then the sustainability of what that means in terms of the structural advantage, it's sort of proving out, you know how versus a lot of the peer base. I guess, do you think the runway on continuing to put up what maybe not this level of bookings outperformance but still superior to kind of industry, you feel like you are sort of building on something that will lengthen your lead versus the peer group or you feel like we are seeing sort of the step-up and then it maybe renormalizes back to the average over out of the next 12 months, 24 months.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean, you know normalizing is not a term that I like culturally. So no, we are looking - what we are looking to do is accelerate momentum. That is what we are about, and there is no, there is no normalization of any point in time here. There is a big market out there. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that the fundamentals of the industry, we believe are very attractive. Secondly, we look at the market as a whole that is what is being spent in R&D globally. I don't really care whether the spend is internal, external with CROs, with small-medium, we can't really make a rigorous analytical sense of what the market size is and the precise market shares. I think it's very, very hard to ignore the size of our bookings, our book-to-bill ratios, even though we are the largest by far. And then not conclude that you know, there is a market share, a significant market share move here. Now what is it being taken from - I'm not going to speculate that. We don't know, not every competitor is publicly trading. Not everything is disclosed the same way. People lump bookings in a different manner. We haven't changed the way we account for our bookings, it's the same, and it's been the same forever. So there is no change, it's consistently applied, other than the change we made at the merger, which was the switching to a contracted basis, as opposed to just awarded basis, which we believe is more conservative, but other than that, it's consistently applied. And so we are looking to increase our share of spend, our share of wallet with each and every customer large pharma, biotech, domestic, global, FSP, full clinical. We just look at the spend in aggregate and buy clients. We have a centralized, unified account management program and there is no territory that we are not looking at, whatever segment I mentioned you can think of. And we will continue that strategy. Again on the numbers, it's hard to ignore the market share shift. And on the specifics of clients, it's also hard to ignore the moves. I mentioned, we have got over 300 new clients in 2018 alone that we didn't have before. And among the top 20 large pharma, I had mentioned many times that the merger that I was stunned that we didn't do business with many large pharma companies. But since then, we are now doing business and a lot of it with five previously, so called, locked out accounts and That is significant.
Ross Muken: Thanks so much and congrats.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. We take the next question please operator.
Operator: The next question comes line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed.
Jack Meehan: Hi, thanks. And I was hoping could you give a little bit more color on the margin progression for 2019, pleased to see expansion. I know that is cultural for you. But if you could just walk us through some of the initiatives you have going to streamline things on the R&D side versus some of the investments on the TAS side. Just those moving pieces would be helpful.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Jack. Look we will always take faster growth rate over more margin expansion. Like you do the math for you. You know that a point, everything else being equal, a point of faster growth is worth a lot more, a value than a point more of margin. Having said that, I have said it repeatedly and I will say it again, we want to do both. We want to grow and accelerate our revenue growth and we also want to expand our margins. Now there will be times when it could be a quarter in or quarter out, where there may be no margin expansion. But the trends for us, will continue to be to expand our margins. Now it is, when you step back and look at what we have been doing since the merger in terms of investments in the business, investments in the OCE platform, investments in deploying for very large wins like Roche and Novo Nordisk and some of the other wins that we have. Investments in orchestrated clinical technology, OCT suite of products that we are launching or will be launching in 2019. Investments in the NextGen, the Smart Trial automation platforms that we have talked about in E360, in the aggregation and sourcing of additional patient level data. I mentioned we now have over 600 nation - 600 million lives. Investments in virtual trials, all of these means many more. People resources, I think we started the merger with 50,000 people, we are at 58,000 people to support the business growth. We are recruiting a different makeup of skill set population, much higher compensation levels, data scientists who are in very high demand, of technology sales people, also in high demand. Investing in specialty areas, in assets, in emerging markets. So again, a lot of investments and anyone who would be , well served to look at what that means. Very little of that - of those initial resources are capitalized. Our core software development is to a degree, and we are still carrying redundant expenses from the merger. We have got in some cases, systems integration, programs that forces to carry two systems in parallel, That is still not over. We are having resources that are dedicated to the merger and that we cannot capitalize et cetera. So anyone, looking at all of that, should accept that normally, margins should have gone down we they haven't 60 basis points of margin expansion in 2018. So I would suggest that, as we continue to accelerate and we are seeing the fruits of those investments already in 2019, earlier than anticipated. I think, we will continue to invest, there will be ups and downs in our margins, but the long-term trend will be margin expansion. Why and how are we able to do that. Despite all these investments and these headwind. I omitted to mention the acquisitions. Obviously, that always come with margin headwind because they have very little profit or zero, in some cases losses. So all that is headwinds. Why have we been able to overcome all of that headwind and actually generate margin expansion is because, as you said culturally, we are focused on cost containments. We are generating the synergies from the merger and we are instilling in the company a lean culture. We are Kaizen-ing every process. We are reviewing how we do things. And looking at how we can do them better, faster, smarter and transforming our organization to really lean execution machine that can continue to deliver margin expansion well into the future.
Jack Meehan: Thanks for all the detail.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks, Jack. Operator, can you take the next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of a Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Are you won a lot of business on the OCE platform. I know, it was a big focus at the end of 2017. You had mentioned that, at the time that there was a cycle of kind of a renewal cycle where you wanted to gain more market share or recapture more of what you felt belong to the company or the company could get. How far along are we in this cycle? And - or should we see this kind of level of contract wins in kind of the software area continue into 2019 and 2020?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks, Shlomo. Before I answer your question, I just wanted to send you a little bouquet here for that outstanding investor call that you took the initiative of organizing . Actually, we didn't even know about it and it's quite a few - to be able to get a client on record to explain to investors, their experience with our IQ, and it was favorable on top of it, so. Thank you for that. And with respect to OCE and the pipeline, I mentioned in my introductory remarks that look, we have right now over 100 active sales leads. We won over 30 accounts, including two large ones. Virtually every single one of these is a head-to-head competition. The renewal cycle, I mentioned before, is a very, very hard because it's difficult to remove and entrench - provide technology provider. As you all know, in any technology platform and ERP or any application is very difficult. The switching costs are high, but we are not deterred by that. We are going to continue to find out that we have good prospects to win a fair share in that market. We also need to realize that beyond CRM, it's a lot bigger field out there. We mentioned OCT on the clinical technology side, That is a field where there is no renewal cycle. This is a big and emerging opportunity, where a lot of currently paper, labor intensive processes can be used to be automated, not the only ones to observe that opportunity. But we are fighting it out with others and we believe we will gain a fair share of that market as well because of our superior capabilities. So yes, we are very bullish on technology. We have been for the longest time and it's really across the board. So, thank you.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: If I can get a follow-up. Just I think someone was touching on this before, but it seems like the margin expansion, you are getting is despite where - significant investments to deploy these wins. Is there some way you can just kind of give us a hint as to - you know, how long these deployments will take? I know there is the investments for the 30 you talked about. Is that going to go through 2019 in halfway through '20. How long should we think about that before they actually start to have a more - really a material contribution to margin expansion instead of being a headwind?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I mean look, this implementation is - when they are global, can take one year, or 1.5 years. We know that the main, the big dominant competitor in this space, in some cases you know four, five years, after we have the contract, they are still deploying some of the countries they were supposed to be brought in. Now we believe we can deploy at a faster rate, That is one of the main advantages of our technology. I believe, the competitive advantage. We can deploy at a faster rate. So it's a one year, 1.5 years, implementation. But again, this is going to continue. In other words, just because we will finish the implementation for these 30 plus wins. We still winning - we hope to win all the business. So we will continue to have implementation all the time, but hopefully - the revenue associated with the software That is already deployed then can more than offsets and it becomes a manageable headwind to our margins when we have new implementations.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And thank you for the shadowed earlier.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks, Shlomo. We take our next question, please, operator.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed.
Eric Coldwell: Hi, thanks very much and good morning. So I have so many different things I could hit on here, but I'm going to divert a little...
Ari Bousbib: Because we give you too many numbers to dissect there.
Eric Coldwell: Yes. You are filibustering us this morning - no, it's all good. So the contract sales division, CSMS, doesn't get a ton of attention and you have been very consistent on that since day one. But you are looking to working on rejuvenating it. I'm hearing more positive things in that side of the market, the commercial market. I think, your two big peers are seeing better things, at least in the US for sure. I would love to get a little more color on what you are seeing why you think it returns to growth in the second half, and you will probably yell at me offline, but I heard a little rumor that you want a pretty decent contract sales engagement this year. I'm curious if you could talk about the pipeline on just straight salesforce wins?
Ari Bousbib: Look - we are pleased that our CSMS business is showing positive signs of stabilization as we head into 2019. When you compare our business to the peers, you have to look at geographic mix, service mix, which again can impact the growth. For example we are very strong in Japan and actually a leading position in Japan. No, none of our peers has anywhere near what we have as a competitive position in Japan. And the Japanese market has been is to well-known fact, has been declining. So therefore, our peers are not as impacted as their business is more skewed to North America and Europe as an example. Certain markets in Europe have also had been a headwind. Some of our competitors, less exposed the largest US competitor is not exposed to those markets, either Japan or Europe. If you look at the service mix. We are weighed more toward CSO type of services, traditional contract salesforce. And the peers have a mix of both legacy CSO services, along with communications, consulting, MSLs et cetera. If you look at what is in the bag, it's a lot of cats and dogs, some of which are actually doing better than contract sales. So it's hard to compare us to peers exactly. And so our peers have done M&A in the space. We haven't, basically, we started the business from that standpoint. And so therefore it's very difficult to compare our peers growth rates without - because of all those reasons, geographic, product mix, they've got stuff in there, That is not really pure contract sales, it's also kind of clouds the numbers, and they've done M&A, we haven't. So having said that, you are correct to say that we have reenergized the business, we told you we were going to do that. Our practice hopefully is to tell you what we are going to do and to do it. And That is what we have done. We are very transparent, we have told you we are going to take that business and give it to the regions. We have very strong operating management, IMS legacy, regional organizational structures that are really outstanding executive operating leaders and they took ownership rate. We stuck it into their P&L and they are incentivized to make it work. So as we are, we needed to spend the decline and stabilize the business, which we are doing. And then hopefully, we are going to transition to growth here. We have got some good aggressive plans. We would like to stretch the businesses and we see where we land. So we gave guidance for flat revenue growth and we look to be favorably, if we can do a little better than that, that would be great, but That is what we are looking at now, but you are correct. We are winning a little bit more. We have a good pipeline, much stronger than we ever had. And we have got some decent wins. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the other business. We don't talk enough about it. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thanks, Ari. Operator, I think we are running out of time, but I would like to maybe just try and squeeze in one more very quick question if we can.
Operator: Sure. The next question comes line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. You know, Ari, I know, appreciate it's difficult to pinpoint, the strength whether it's from share gains or just from a healthy end market seems like both, but I'm curious just, as you have seen more traction across not only large pharma, but emerging biotech as well, what is the reaction from the competitive landscape in. Have you seen any change in behavior from those that you are going head-to-head with in the RFPs that you have been winning?
Ari Bousbib: I don't know, look, we are what I can tell you is they spend a lot more time looking at what we do, then we spend time looking at would they do. And so we have got a totally different strategy. It's hard to bucket our competitors into one group because they you have got those that continue to be dismissive of our approach. Initially it was about data doesn't matter, technology doesn't matter, then it was about we are losing all of our people, you know, we are not really booking real stuff, whatever it is, you talked to them more than we do. And I respect competition, it's good to have healthy competition. We have got a lot of players that are very good in what they do. Our approach is just different. We are leveraging unparalleled, unmatched capabilities that combined unique information assets, advanced analytics, machine learning technology, capabilities and most importantly domain knowledge across therapeutic areas that no one comes close to. And we do all of that on a global basis in a 100 markets. That is very different than what other people do. We do leverage those capabilities across everything that we bring to our customers, whether it's on the commercial side, in the real world strategy and we are in the early stages of finalizing our - the next leg of our journey, which we call internally V 2022 - Vision 2022. At the time of the merger, we gave you mid-term strategy, meaning what will happen in the 2017, 2018, 2019 three year period and we believe we are delivering on that promise and on those goals. Sometime this year, we are trying to pin down the dates. We would like to invite all of you to join us for the Investor Day. Well, we hope to be in a position to give you what our plans are, and our strategic objectives are for the next three year - our journey the 2021, 2022 timeframe. So with that I'm going to conclude. Thank you all for your patience and it was a longer call. And obviously Mike and Andrew and Jennifer will be available for follow-up calls as usual. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on first quarter 2019 earnings call. Jen and I will be available for the rest of day to take up any follow-up questions you have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Monday, October 22, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Jenifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis.  Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with Company’s business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards which is discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings call. I’m pleased to report that Q3 was another quarter of strong financial performance. And once again, we report results at the high end or above our guidance ranges. To review the numbers, our third quarter revenue of $2,594 million came in at the high end of our guidance range and thus despite the headwinds from FX of approximately $10 million. Revenue growth was 6.3% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was strong despite the traditional Q3 demand softness on the commercial side of the business. Constant currency Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth was 15% in the third quarter. And again consistent with the first and second quarter, organic constant currency growth was about 4%. I think actually year-to-date constant currency organic growth rate on Technology & Analytics Solutions was over 4%. R&D Solutions revenue grew 3.5% at constant currency. Early in the third quarter, we marked the anniversary of all acquired R&D businesses, and therefore, this growth is organic. As you know, we experienced some quarterly lumpiness associated with the timing of revenue recognition and pass-through under ASC 606. In fact, pass-through this quarter crossed several hundred basis points of R&D growth. As expected, third quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions growth was down about 12% at constant currency. Switching to profit. Adjusted EBITDA of $561 million was above our guidance range, and it grew 8.4% at constant currency. Third quarter adjusted income margin expanded 80 basis points reported and 40 basis points at constant currency, reflecting the continued impact of our synergy realization and cost-containment initiatives. Let’s look a bit at our year-to-date margin expansion. Year-to-date revenue conversion contributed a 120 basis points of margin expansion and all cost take out actions contributed a 140 basis points of margin expansion. As you know, we’ve been making investments in our technology suite, technology acquisitions, our next generation of clinical development offering, and the expansion of our real-world platform. All of these initiatives have a diluted impact on our margins. These items, all net to 70 basis points of year-to-date margin expansion at current currency -- I’m sorry, at constant currency. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.42 grew 19.3% and was again at the high end of our guidance range. This result was driven entirely by our strong operational performance. I want to spend a few minutes on a couple of important partnerships and how we are doing in the market. You will have seen that we announced the expansion of our partnership with Salesforce. This follows a successful launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE platform, which is powered by Force.com, Marketing Cloud, and Mulesoft. The team is now working in close collaboration with Salesforce to develop Orchestrated Clinical Trials or OCT, the first of its kind suite of integrated clinical applications designed to make clinical trials more efficient. We are very excited that this technology will be powered by Health Cloud. And we are looking forward to organic Salesforce on joint go-to-market initiatives. We continue to have success in the market with OCE. And the recent number of smaller wins continues to drive momentum. Since we launched OCE in December, we have now won 15 out of 20 competitions in this space. We will have seen -- you will have seen that we’ve issued a press release last week announcing that our OCE platform was selected by Roche for global deployment. In addition, the deal includes our ePromo, MDM, and Organization Manager applications. We are committed to investing in the success of this milestone agreement, have obviously strong execution here with strength in the offering in the marketplace, and continue to highlight our global deployment capabilities. In the real-world space, the team signed an important collaboration with Genomics England where we will work together to launch the first real-world research platform with integrated clinical and genomic data. R&D Solutions had a record quarter of contracted bookings. Our first quarter contracted net new business excluding pass-through was $1.7 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.69 for the quarter. Bookings growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2017. We are excited about the trajectory of our contracted NMV. But remember, this is a long cycle business and bookings today will take a while to be reflected in revenue. The next generation clinical development team continues to drive this. We had another strong quarter with gross new business award of over $600 million, which excludes pass-through associated with this revenue. This means that less than two years into the merger, we have almost $3 billion of awards that leverage our core enabled capabilities, again excluding pass-through. With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, we reported strong third quarter financials. Let’s reviews the results. Third quarter revenue of $2,594 million grew 6.3% at constant currency and 5.2% reported. Year-to-date, revenue was $7,724 million, grew 6.4% at constant currency and 7.6% reported. Third-quarter Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,014 million grew 15% at constant currency and 12.9% reported. Technology & Analytics Solutions year-to-date revenue of 3,010 million grew 12.5% at constant currency and 13.8% reported. Year-to-date Technology & Analytics Solutions organic revenue was over 4% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $1,382 million grew 3.5% at constant currency and 3.1% at actual FX rates. Year-to-date, R&D Solutions revenue of $4,097 million grew 5.8% at constant currency and 6.8% at actual FX rates. Year-to-date, R&D Solutions organic revenue growth was about 4.5% at constant currency. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $198 million, declined 11.9% at constant currency and 12.8% reported. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $617 million declined 13.3% at constant currency and 11.7% at actual FX rates. Now, moving down the P&L. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $561 million grew 8.4% at constant currency and 9.4% reported. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA grew 10% at constant currency and 10.6% reported, resulting in adjusted EBITDA year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points at constant currency and 60 basis points reported. Third quarter GAAP net income was $60 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29. Adjusted net income of $294 million grew 13.1% in the third quarter. Growth was primarily driven by stronger adjusted EBITDA and tax efficiencies, partially offset by higher interest expense. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of the $1.42 grew 19.3%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher adjusted net income, which I just discussed, as well as the lower share count year-over-year. Year-to-date, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 grew 21.3%. Let’s spend a few minutes on R&D Solutions net new business. Last 12 months contracted net new business excluding pass-through at September 30, 2018 was $5.37 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 22.9%. As you know, we now report backlog including pass-through. On this basis, we’ve had good backlog progression over the last four quarters. And at September 30, 2018, closing backlog was $16.4 billion. Now, let’s have a look at the balance sheet. At September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $827 million and debt was $10.6 billion, resulting in net debt of about $9.8 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.5 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $344 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $123 million and free cash flow was $221 million. During the third quarter, we repurchased $133 million of our shares, resulting in $792 million of year-to-date share repurchase at an average price of $105.34. Since the merger, we have completed $4.4 billion of share repurchase at an average price of $86.07. At September 30, we had $889 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Let’s now turn to 2018 guidance. We’re updating our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. As you know, revenue guidance has been raised twice this year, largely, to reflect our stronger organic performance. Unfortunately, foreign currency has now turned against us. But despite a $35 million headwind from FX for the balance of the year versus our previous guidance, we are reaffirming the midpoint of the full-year guidance range. We now expect revenue to be between $10,300 million and 10,350 million, and that represents year-over-year growth of 6.2% to 6.7%. Now, it’s still too early to guide to 2019 as we’re in the middle of our planning process. But recall, at the beginning of this year, we guided 2018 revenue under the new accounting standard, including pass-through and our declining Contract Sales & Medical Solutions business. This guidance was 3% to 5% growth and included a tailwind from FX of about a 100 basis points. As you know, we are beating this original guidance, despite the FX headwinds we are experiencing in the second half of the year. Again, it is too early to guide 2019. We expect to do this on our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. But we do want to share what we currently see on our top line for 2019 from a currency perspective. As we sit here looking at rates today, assuming they stay unchanged in 2019, and compare these rate to the average rates of 2018, it would result in a headwind of about $125 million to our constant currency revenue growth in 2019. Now, back to 2018. Adjusted EBITDA guidance has been raised by $10 million at the midpoint. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,195 million and $2,225 million, representing year-over-year growth of 9.2% to 10.7%. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised by a nickel at the midpoint. We now expect full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.45 and $5.55, which represents year-over-year growth of 19.8% to 22%. Our adjusted book tax rate is still expected to be approximately 23%. This guidance assumes current foreign currency rates remain in effect for the rest of the year. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong finical results. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 70 basis points at constant currency. We extended our partnership with Salesforce to develop a suite of clinical trial technology. OCE continues to drive momentum in the market with Roche becoming an important reference client. Our RWI team sings an important collaboration with Genomics England to launch the first real-world research platform with integrated clinical and genomic data. R&D Solutions LTM contracted services net new business grew approximately 23%, supported by record contracted bookings in the quarter. We executed $133 million of share repurchase in the quarter, bringing the total post-merger repurchase to $4.4 billion at an average price of $86.07, and we’ve reaffirm revenue guidance for the year and we raised our profit guidance. And with that, I’ll ask the operator to open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions, Ari and Mike. I guess, just -- I appreciate the perspective, Mike, on FX. And, I know you are not in a position, as you mentioned, to give guidance on ‘19. But, I wanted to just ask a question on the R&D segment specifically. You sit here today on a trailing book-to-bill of 1.38. Conversion rates have been fairly steady, ticked down a little bit this quarter for you guys. So, I just was hoping maybe you could share some perspectives on when we should start to think about the top line accelerating more commensurate to the levels of the type of bookings growth that you guys have been experiencing?
Ari Bousbib: Maybe I’ll say a couple of words and Mike can feel free to chip in. Look Bob, we’d like to see this today, but it’s a long cycle business. We always said, since the time of the merger that we would begin to see the benefits of the merger on our top line, exiting third year after the merger. That’s not going to be before the end of ‘19, and we are sticking to that plan and target. Now, having said that, you are correct we are actually doing probably better than we expected in terms of our market share gains and bookings, perhaps a little than we had anticipated. But, I do want to remind you that today -- and we are going to have these for the next quarter or two, we are executing backlog that was sold -- booked before the merger. And you may want to have some perspective and recall that in some quarters before the merger, we actually had book-to-bill ratios that were below 1. And so, we are in a sense fighting that adverse effect of bookings and have been at least above 1, and maybe we would start to see some growth accelerating earlier than the end of ‘19. But again, we are delivering growth in our R&D, despite these backlog issues prior to the merger. We are delivering growth that I think better than all of us were expecting. Year-to-date, what’s our R&D growth…
Michael McDonnell: Year-to-date organic? About 4.5%...
Ari Bousbib: Overall…
Michael McDonnell: The only thing I would add as well, as since [ph] we’ve moved to the new accounting standard on 606, this is our first year of implementing, and we recast last year. We are seeing some lumpiness as we go through the year that I think -- and Ari mentioned in the remarks, Under 605, we would have been several hundred basis points higher. We got to translate this through to the new accounting standard as well.
Ari Bousbib: Right. If you add -- again, pass-throughs are pretty much where we thought they would be. They’re kind of flattish year-over-year, and that’s creating a headwind to our growth of several basis points, consistently we had since the beginning of the year.
Robert Jones: And then, I guess, Ari, just one quick follow-up. I know you usually share a little bit in the prepared remarks on the sources of bookings, obviously another big quarter as you mentioned o wins for you guys on the R&D segment. So, I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit on the sources of the strength big pharma versus emerging biotech, and maybe if there is any individual single outsized wins in the quarter that really helped bolster that bookings number?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I have got some numbers here. Thanks for the question. Year-to-date, if you look at gross new bookings in the EBP segment, which continues to be very, very strong frankly in the marketplace and for us in particular. As you know we put renewed emphasis on the go-to-market in EBP since after the merger. Year-to-date, we have 73% or 75%...
Michael McDonnell: Year-to-date 78%.
Ari Bousbib: 78%, right, so almost 80%, in the quarter -- actually the growth, I am even afraid of mentioning the number, but it’s just under 90% growth in the third quarter for EBP, our gross new bookings. So, again, I think, I mentioned that year-to-year -- I didn’t mention this. On a year-to-date basis, gross new business award, which probably is a best way to look at market share, this is awards, not contracted and this is on a gross basis, they grew year-to-date 30% in aggregate. So, again, very, very strong, but again, a big, big piece comes from the growth in EBP. So, yes, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Muken: So, I wanted to go back on the technology business. Obviously, you had the phenomenal Roche announcement. It seems like that will give you more sort of selling cloud in the universe and obviously you talked about competitive win. Just help us paint a picture for where we are in that process and how this sort of competitive sell-through is going. Obviously, you have the very dominant market position already and now you’re selling in new technology capability. So, to see someone like Roche take everything on, obviously quite impressive. Do you think there will be more things like that? Do you think it’s going to help you on singular replacement? Just give us a little bit of flavor for how you are going to use that as a means of trying to push others in industry in the similar direction?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks for the question. Look, I want to answer the question more from a strategic standpoint. If you look at what we’ve been doing, and this was true before the merger of IMS and certainly has continued and accelerated since the merger of IQVIA, a very significant area for investments for us is to embed data analytics and technology in everything we do. And the reason I believe this is very important to understand is, look, we don’t want to be in commoditized businesses. We want to add value to our customers. We want to the sell based on outcomes and value and on performance. We want to embed strong intellectual property in everything we do and build long, sustainable partnerships with our clients well into the future, and gain a bigger share of their spend. To step back, our pharma clients spend globally spent well over $200 billion in the type of stuff that we offer. We are the largest provider of these services by far across the board at over $10 billion of revenue a year versus our competitors in any of the segments that we compete in. And so, even we are the largest in any of these businesses, that still represents less than 5% market share of the total spend. There is no one in the world of pharma that doesn’t buy something from us. So, we already are present, as you say, in all of these clients. And we have a great commercial footprint that we can continue to leverage and try to gain share of that spend. That’s our strategy. And technology is front and center of the core of these. So, with respect to the segment -- narrow segment of CRM, and as we redefined it, OCE, our strategy has been to integrate applications across the board to make it a seamless experience for our clients and deliver SaaS applications that are very easy to use, easy to plug in that can leapfrog what’s already in the market. We have this great collaboration with Salesforce that led to the OCE platform we launched in December. We believe it’s -- the next generation solution is obviously built on a more advanced Salesforce platform, than anything that was in the market before. So, it benefits from that added functionality and standardization. And we’ve seen that this is what we want at Roche, and this is a large global deployment in over a hundred markets. It’s very significant in every dimension you can think of. And you can be sure that we’ve been discussing similar type of engagements with all of the large pharma. Now regretfully, they are on a different platform now and it’s a higher ramp and we need to get to the point where they are going to consider, switching over, and we’re working on that. Having said that, anyone else who’s looking for a new platform, typically we’ve been wining in the vast majority of the cases, and we will continue that. Now, I also want to say a word about our expansion in clinical technology. We made a lot of investments right off the bat immediately after the acquisition. That’s why we spent a lot of money in acquisition, the first year, last year. You see that this has tampered as you see. I don’t think we did much acquisition this quarter. [Multiple Speakers] Yes, 20, $30 million, nothing. And we’ve built I think a very, very strong set of capabilities, which we are now integrating. And we are going to do this on Health Cloud with Salesforce; we’ve expanded our pharmacies. They are very excited about it; we’re very excited about it. And it’s going to be even more integrated on the commercial side because this is new. There’s really no competition out there. People have point solutions once again. And we are going to take our Orchestrated Clinical Technology or OCT to market as soon as we are ready. The technology will cover areas such as regulated content management, regulatory compliance and of course, the virtual trials that we’ve been talking about. So, again, we’re very excited about this. And we believe this will differentiate us in the market place and accelerate our penetration of pharma.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: How should we be thinking about the quarterly progression at some of the incremental expenses associated with some of the near-term investments? You called out in IT [ph] systems and other initiatives in the prepared remarks. And more broadly, where do we stand now in terms of those underlying cost savings or integrations synergy targets?
Ari Bousbib: In terms of margins, you are right. I mean, all the things I just mentioned, don’t come for free, certainly Next-Gen capabilities build-up continues to be a headwind because we continue to hire in a tight market, very expensive, highly qualified data scientist. It’s probably the single most sought out after skill set. Everyone wants to be in artificial intelligence and predictive analysis and machine learning, and that’s what we are all about. We’ve been talking about this long before. It’s become a buzzword. We continue to invest in this area. We continue to invest in our technology suite and development program with Salesforce, as I discussed; and of course the implementation. I mean look, the first year of implementing large deployment, like the one with Roche is not profitable endeavor for us. So, these clearly are headwinds, but we are committed to continue to deliver margin expansion. Obviously, as we deploy in the years ahead these technologies and there is a less of that headwind, then obviously, margins should continue to creep at a much faster speed than they are. If you eliminate -- that’s why I wanted to share with you the year-to-date margin expansion at constant currency, you can see that absent the headwinds, we have expanded margins a lot more. There’s a revenue drop through of course form accelerating growth and then there is all the cost containment and the integration synergies which we are very on track to deliver. I think we are a little ahead probably on the cost target. You will remember we had $200 million of cost takeout everything else being the same on the base line we had at the time of the merger. And we said this would be fully there, exiting ‘19, and therefore, you will get all the benefit in ‘20. However, I think we are seeing an acceleration of that and we are very much probably I would say Andrew and Mike, correct me if I am wrong, how much of the $200 million have been executed, probably I would say two-thirds. Yes. We are in the two-thirds, 70% exiting ‘18; we will be 70% in and that comes in, in the ‘19 numbers already with the last 30% continuing so far. That’s what is for the integration.
Erin Wright: And just quick one on the fixed price model. What percentage of new business I guess are you applying that as it stands today?
Ari Bousbib: Fixed price? Let’s see. I have got the numbers here for you. On the Next-Gen awards, this is in the quarter or year-to-date? Overall, yes, yes. I think about 50% approximately of everything that we have been awarded to-date, so I said before it’s almost $3 billion since the merger, about 50% is on the fixed price. Sometimes it’s not all fixed price, but let’s say, call it fixed price of this $3 billion. And if you look across R&D bookings, all included, going forward, what we are trying to -- what we are trying to -- what we’re seeing here based on the numbers we are looking at here going forward, I would say about a third of all of our bookings will have either all fixed price or some significant portion that’s on a fixed price basis, about a third, all inclusive, not just this.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger: Ari, just to go back to your comments about the OCT suite of clinical products, can you give us a sense about timing? When do you expect to roll those out to the market?
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, we already are in the market, again sending point solutions. You are familiar with [indiscernible] and we also actually sold a couple of small pilot trials on the virtual trial front. We also sold some very nice work on the compliance side to few large top five European pharma companies. But, look, it’s going to take a little bit of time to develop. The program really calls for later in ‘19 to have our first fully integrated clinical trial technology suite.
John Kreger: And then, maybe, Mike, you could maybe take this one. I think the last three quarters you’ve talked about next 12-month expected backlog to revenue conversion of about $4.6 billion. Can you just talk a little bit about what are the puts and takes that’s kind of kept that number pretty stable despite the much stronger net awards that you have reported of late?
Michael McDonnell: Yes. I want to remind you that the FX comments that we made on this, Bob, we lost about $35 million to FX for the balance of ‘18 from a revenue perspective. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there’s about $125 million of a headwind that we see, based on current rates in 2019. So, that goes right to that metric. At the time that we recasted our opening backlog, it was about $4.5 billion that progressed to $4.6 billion. I would note that we are seeing some very good success with Next-Gen as we talked about it, but that also shifts the mix to some more complex businesses. And we have probably a larger mix of historically slower burning projects, as a result of having more complex trials that will take a little longer to complete. So, I think overall, there is some rounding in the FX is really the primary thing that I would point to on that metric.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I had the same situation. Unfortunately we’re using -- I assume that we’ll have the effect on -- I don’t remember here, but I don’t see the number here. But, this $4.6 billion over the next 12 months should be quite -- could be higher, right, if we haven’t had…
Michael McDonnell: Without the FX.
Ari Bousbib: Right. So, that’s -- a big portion of the $125 million that we talked about the headwind next year is actually in R&D. And again, I think that also the 2016 weak booking is also reflection of that. There were some of them which we’re again executing. This is why it’s around. But, remember, when we book a $1 today, it does translate into maybe $0.09 or $0.10 of revenue the following year and then it ramps up further $0.25 to $0.30. So, really ‘18, ‘19 is when we are seeing revenue from the bookings in ‘16, which I’ll remind you were not that special. So, that’s part of it, and it’s the mix as well. As more complex projects, which we -- more specialty stuff, where most of the Next-Gen capabilities apply, so it takes a little bit of time to run this up. But, it’s a mix issue as well. So, it’s a bunch of mix and match. But, I agree with you, I would like to this number tick up. And we would have ended up significantly, absent the FX.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much and good morning. I had a -- I think a couple of people have asked around my topic. But, I hate to be very client specific. But, since you do having named Pharma account with OCE, I’m hoping you can give us a little more sense on sizing, timing, cost impact. I think, Ari, you might have suggested that that will not be a profitable endeavor in year one, as you obviously want to spend a lot of money to rank that account up and do it the right way, that would be a good benchmark for future big pharma wins. But if we could get any kind of financial details or timing details around that OCE win would be very helpful.
Ari Bousbib: So, I would love -- that’s a good question, Eric. To be honest with you, I would love to give you the number, but we’re not authorized to share that number. And it’s a large deal. We shared the number of… 
Michael McDonnell: We did 14,000... 
Ari Bousbib: Yes. It’s 14,000 seats, which is pretty large by CRM standards in contract, in over 100 countries. So, if you try to figure out what -- and again, it includes also a lot of other stuff. It’s not just CRM; I mentioned promo and so on, and yes, management. So, it’s a large contract. Okay. I mean, I think the numbers for license proceeds, this is a software business model, as you know, there is some implementation upfront on a front number. But then, it’s on the software basis. And the deal is -- we mentioned how many years? It’s 5 years, I don’t remember.
Michael McDonnell: Yes. The contract can be three to five years. These kind of deals are very sticky.
Ari Bousbib: Right. And again, you can probably derive some kind of range, but it’s a large deal. It’s larger that what my collogues at the legacy Quintiles organization would call an elephant trial. So, it’s a large number. So, more importantly, look, I mean, the market has been dominated largely by one company and that company probably has 80%, 90% share of large pharma clients. We only launched OCE in December. And we have not so much revenue here. So, we see a great market opportunity. It’s large segment, people say it about $2 billion. There is a large pharma renewal cycle that takes place over the 12 to 18 months. So, we think fair shot at claiming a non-insignificant share of the market because we strongly believe we have a superior solution.
Eric Coldwell: If I could shift gears and just quickly ask on contract sales and medical solutions. Obviously, it’s not a focal point for IQVIA, and it’s not an area where I think your investor base overly concerned. But, I would be interested in getting the market update. What you are hearing in the market, what you are seeing in the market, where the bookings in that segment -- I know you don’t report them per se, but what does the bookings profile look like, when do you expect that growth to perhaps stabilize or even turn around a bit?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. So, I can’t speak to bookings or to the market in general. But I can tell you that it’s not that it’s not the priority, it’s a smaller part of the business. But, since we pulled this out of the market, as you know, we were -- our first goal around was to try to divest. And we decided that we are going to retain it for now. And we have actually put a lot of emphasis from a managerial standpoint, over the past few months, in turning around this business. Now, we are now executing whatever was told before. But, I think we are -- let me put it this way. I am challenging the team to turn this trend around. I don’t want to see any red next year. And hopefully, we will turn this right. As we said, it’s early because we are in the mid of the planning cycle. But hopefully, I am looking forward to putting a marker for ‘19. That’s a bit more positive I can put it this way, than what you’ve seen to-date, over the past few years, in that business. And of course, we are of course trying to drive cost down and take it to market in a more accelerated fashion. So, that’s what I can share now. So, yes, I have good hopes and I am certainly targeting better performance in ‘19.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with UBS.
Daniel Brennan: Ari and Mike, just a few questions on Next-Gen. So, of your existing CRO customer base, how many have been pitched Next-Gen to-date and quickly can you roll out Next-Gen to the clients that haven’t seen it? And then, just one more part to this, in terms of the wins you’ve seen. How much -- how many of these wins are coming from existing customers versus share gains from new customers adopting?
Ari Bousbib: Well, look, I’ve got a lot of data on Next-Gen, because as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time on this. As I’ve said many times, what we did -- we wanted to prove this out. Right? So, to start to our existing clients, it would have been very hard to know whether we would have won anyway because we have got good relationships and so on so forth. So, we wanted to really go after, so called locked out accounts and tried to win with clients who are not our clients. Clients who had been working this industry for a long time, for too long, and I’m only speaking about large pharma now. The function very much, I hate to say this, these lawyers and the rules, but like somewhat of a duopoly. [Ph] People, the market stabilized in a sense with -- this large pharma works with these two or three CROs; this pharma works -- and that’s because they are dealing with this industry like a commodity type of service and they can’t go out and have an RFP to hundreds CROs and have a hundreds features and shows from these CROs. They need to work with two or three to keep everybody honest. And they peak based on relationships and what have you. And we came to disrupt this model. We want to go after the entire market. We don’t want to just work with our three buddies, large pharma. We want to work with everybody, we want -- because we want to compete on value and superior technology. And we want to bring differentiated value to the market. So, therefore, it was a little harder at the beginning because we had a higher ramp. But the good news is, we have won with large pharma clients, which we were doing work -- we hadn’t done work for many, many years, sometimes more than 12 years. Now, we -- of course, we didn’t spend much time with our reducing clients. And we had also limited capabilities. We are now getting to hopefully an inflection point where pretty much everyone has heard of Next-Gen and pretty one very much everyone has had the chance. I’m talking about the top 20 pharma clients, they have had a chance to get a pitch or a presentation from our teams. And in many cases -- now, they don’t always have a trial that’s suitable. They don’t always have RFP that where they want to bring us in. But, we less than two years into the merger, we have won almost $3 billion of awards, and a lot it with people who were not our clients before with new customers. We had some nice -- in the quarter by the way, we had top 10 pharma who was not a traditional client of the legacy Quintiles organization, top 10 whom we won a Phase 3 MX trail as long as we are allowed to say but MX [ph] trial. And again, that was totally based on our capabilities, on patient density data, and predictive analytics. We won another top 10 pharma that is a client of ours, several neurology trials, again using Next-Gen capabilities. We have got a lot of EBP clients as well, people we’ve never worked with before, oncology studies. By the way, I would say, of the almost $3 billion of Next-Gen, I just want to -- I always report the awarded members. I should say, about 75% of these have been contracted. So not everything else has been contracted yet, just time. I hope this color on Next-Gen gives you some more details. Do we have time for another question?
Andrew Markwick: Yes. Let’s take another question, please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Juan Avendano: This is Juan Avendano for Derik. My question is, at your last Analyst Day, you communicated a net leverage target ratio of 4 to 4.5 times. Given recent developments in the interest rate environment, do you still see this relatively high net leverage as appropriate for the Company? 
Michael McDonnell: Yes. This is Mike speaking. I would say, absolutely, you may have seen that we ended the quarter, net debt at about 4.5 times. So, we’re very comfortable at that level. We have a very good high visibility business with R&D, typically the better part of 80% of the expected revenue in years sitting in backlog. We have a subscription business, data and lot of the tech business; we just have very good cash flow visibility, only about 4% CapEx intensity. We’ve moved our maturities out to 2023 and beyond. And importantly, we fixed a lot of our debt. So, to your question about rates and potential increases, when you look at our elements of fixed debt and consider the swaps that we put in place and other protections that we have in the way of floors and caps and so forth, you get to remember that’s about 75% or little higher of our debt that’s effectively fixed. So, I think we’re sitting right in the sweet spot of a logical leverage level we’re very comfortable with it.
Ari Bousbib: With our average…
Michael McDonnell: And our average cost of debt is running at about 3.8%. So, we’ve got very -- and after-tax probably closer to 3%. So, it’s a very comfortable level for us.
Ari Bousbib: And what about our maturities?
Michael McDonnell: Yes. Our maturities, there is nothing significant really until 2024.
Juan Avendano: Thank you. And a quick follow-up on the R&D Solutions segment. Much of your focus has been on data-driven strategies around patient recruitment. But perhaps, if you could -- aside from data and analytics, can you tell us a little bit more your clinical research site strategy? Perhaps, how many sites, you have relationships with, how many of those sites you own, and how your site network strategy fits in your overall patient recruitment strategy?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. I think we have that -- look, we run almost a 1,000 clinical trials -- full clinical trials and a few hundred more where we are involved not necessarily as full clinical but provided resources. I don’t have those numbers here. But, I’m sure we can provide you with the number of sites we work with. And of course we have strategy, that’s a classical way we do business with all of our competitors. I just don’t have those numbers right here. I’m sure you can follow up. Andrew will be happy to provide you with these numbers. 
Andrew Markwick: Thanks very much. I think, we can end the call please, operator. We will be available for the rest of day to take follow-up questions from anyone if they have questions following the call. And we look forward to speaking to everyone again on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you kindly disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Markwick - VP, IR  Ari Bousbib - Chairman, CEO & President  Michael McDonnell - EVP & CFO

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 24, 2018.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, my lad, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and we're also joined by General Counsel, Eric Sherbet. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Security and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release and conference call presentation.  Now you will have seen in our press release that we renamed 2 of our reporting segments. These changes were made to provide more clarity and better describe the offerings within these segments. Commercial Solutions has been changed to Technology & Analytics Solutions, and Integrated Engagement Services has been changed to Contract Sales & Medical Solutions. These are name changes only. Nothing has changed with respect to the composition of any of our segments.  I would now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. Well, thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to report that Q2 was another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. We saw our business momentum accelerate, especially across our R&D, technology and R&D -- and real-world businesses. This was driven by the strategic investments that we've been talking about over the past 18 months, Investments in the buildout of our technology suite, investments in our next generation of clinical development offering and investments in the expansion of our real-world platform and capabilities. Okay, let's review the results. Second quarter revenue was $2,567,000,000. Growth came in above the high end of our expectations at 9%. This beat of $47 million was driven by three roughly equal components, first, organic operational upside in both our R&D Solutions and our Technology & Analytics Solutions businesses; second, the higher pass-through associated with our R&D Solutions revenue; and third, the contribution from tuck-in acquisitions. As a result of this strong performance, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $175 million at the midpoint. This is notwithstanding a $30 million FX headwind versus the last time we updated guidance. Mike will provide more detail later.  Let me provide some color on our growth businesses. Second quarter Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue grew 14.2% reported and 13.1% at constant FX. Tech & Analytics constant currency organic growth was about 4%, the same as in the first quarter. We have seen continued good growth in our real-world business. We spoke to you last quarter about new capabilities in single-arm studies, and we noted last quarter a significant win. This quarter, we had another significant win, this time with a top 5 pharma client. This project will set up a retrospective synthetic real-world data arm in Europe to benchmark the results of the client's single-arm oncology trial. This will help understand the standard of care and allow for the optimal positioning of the product at the time of launch, an excellent example of how the suite of capabilities, from molecule to market, comes to play here. Moving to our tech business. As you know, we've been making significant investments in innovation. We replatformed our commercial applications onto Salesforce's marketing cloud and Force.com and recently launched our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering. OCE is a collaborative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our clients' commercial operations. It is highly differentiated from the current point solutions that exist in the market such as CRM, KOL and marketing campaign management solutions. We've seen great traction out of the gate for our OCE offering, which was launched in December of last year. We've already won deals with Pierre Fabre, Recordati, PruGen as well as a number of other EBP clients in the U.S. and Canada.  Now in addition, I am pleased to report 3 additional significant recent awards. First, a top 10 pharma client has made the decision to standardize on our OCE platform globally. Second, a top 20 pharma client has signed a deal to roll out OCE in a Top 3 pharma market. And third, a global specialty midsized pharma company will deploy OCE in 18 countries.  I want to highlight that this is a market that has been largely dominated by an incumbent player for a long time. When we decided to invest and innovate, our intent was to capture a fair share of this market. While there is a lot of work to do here, I do want to mention that since we launched OCE at the end of last year, we have won 8 out of 10 competitions in this space. The team is very excited by the momentum we're starting to see in our technology business. In fact, on the drug safety and risk management side, we just won 2 major global awards with 2 top 10 pharma clients. These are great wins in the growing pharma covigilance market for our newly integrated suite of clinical technology applications. Moving to R&D Solutions. Growth was 9.6% reported and 8.3% at constant FX, including 2 points of growth from acquisitions. Now let's talk about how we are doing in the marketplace and winning new business. We had strong bookings this quarter. Our LTM contracted net new business, excluding pass-throughs, is $4.88 billion, which represents growth of over 20% compared to the LTM contracted net new business number as of Q2 2017. In fact, with respect to awarded business, this was the largest dollar value of bookings ever awarded to us in a quarter.  Now we've tried to wean ourselves off the quarterly book-to-bill metric. We continue to believe that looking at the overall dollar value of bookings is a lot more meaningful. But given that there have been accounting changes, and given that our competitors continue to report on this basis, I felt that this quarter, I would give you the book-to-bill metric on both a 606 and a 605 basis. I am not going to do this every time, but just to help you with comparisons.  First, if you were to calculate on an as-contracted 606 basis that is including pass-through revenue, you would derive a 1.42 book-to-bill for the quarter. Second, if you were to calculate on an as-contracted basis with the old 605 accounting standard, meaning without the pass-throughs, you would derive a 1.34 book-to-bill for the quarter. This is a little lower than the 606 approach because of the different mix of pass-through in bookings versus revenue. Again, I do want to emphasize that book-to-bill is an imperfect metric, especially in a given quarter, as there are many different definition and a lot of false precision.  Actually, let me go off script here for a minute. People include all kinds of stuff in their bookings, a sack of potatoes and salt and pepper and mix the whole thing. And we try to clean that up, as you know. Furthermore, we operate in 100 countries. We have different mix of geographies than anyone else. So just can -- if you just take the FX, for example, you know that this quarter, the dollar strengthened dramatically. And so when you look at our backlog, it's been obviously revalued for the FX rate at the very end of the quarter, meaning the last day of the quarter. So if you adjust for the FX impact on the backlog, the 606 book-to-bill of 1.42 would actually be north of 1.5. And maybe that's a better way to look at market share because, again, people have different mixes of geographies. Now since I brought up market share, I might as well tell you that if you went back to the old as-awarded basis for calculating book-to-bill, which most of our competitors still look at, and again, if you look at it in terms of how much business was awarded to everyone, that might be a better kind of gauge of how we're doing with respect to market share. Well, on an old awarded basis, the book-to-bill in the quarter would have been -- okay, I'm not going to say, well north of 1.5. Actually, well, well north of 1.5. And that's whether we adjust it for FX or not. Okay. I know that a lot of numbers. And the point I'm trying to make here is whatever way you look at it, we had a great, great quarter for R&D bookings. Okay. I'm going to go back to the script. Mike, Eric, Andrew, you can relax.  The important point here is that regardless of how you choose to measure book-to-bill, you will see that this is clearly the single highest dollar bookings quarter we've ever had. Our gross new business awards were up over 40% compared to the second quarter of 2017, with over 60% growth in the EBP space. We added over 150 new customers in the R&D business during the first half of 2018. We're winning business with clients that have done very little R&D work with the legacy Quintiles organization in the past. The investments we have made in our go-to-market model, customer relationships, analytics and technology capabilities, and specifically, our next generation of clinical development offering are clearly paying off.  In fact, the sequential ramp in our next-generation clinical development bookings continues to accelerate. The team was awarded approximately $700 million of new business in the quarter, which excludes pass-through associated with this revenue. This brings the total post-merger next generation of clinical development awards to about $2.3 billion, again, excluding pass-throughs.  Now turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA of $533 million grew 14.1% reported and 14.3% at constant currency. We continue to operate with discipline with -- and combined with the results of our cost-containment initiatives and the realization of merger synergies, we delivered another quarter of solid margin expansion. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.29 had strong growth, over 25%. Adjusted diluted EPS was also $0.08 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided for the quarter. This $0.08 are comprised of $0.05 drop-through from the adjusted EBITDA beat and $0.03 from the tax efficiency.  With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the financials, which, I'll remind you, are now on an ASC 606 basis for all periods presented. Second quarter revenue of $2,567,000,000 grew 9% reported and 7.7% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,011,000,000 grew 14.2% reported and 13.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $1,350,000,000 grew 9.6% at actual FX rates and 8.3% at constant currency. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $206 million declined 13.4% at actual FX rates and 15.1% at constant currency.  Moving down the P&L. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $533 million grew 14.1% reported and 14.3% at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 90 basis points on a reported basis and 120 basis points at constant currency. GAAP net income was $61 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.29. Adjusted net income of $270 million grew 17.9%. Growth was primarily driven by stronger adjusted EBITDA, which was partially offset by higher interest expense.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 grew 25.2%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher adjusted net income, which I just discussed, as well as the lower share count year-over-year. Let's take a quick look at year-to-date revenue. First half revenue of $5,130,000,000 grew 8.8% reported and 6.5% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,996,000,000 grew 14.2% reported and 11.2% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,715,000,000 grew 8.8% at actual rate and 7% at constant currency. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $419 million declined 11.2% at actual FX rates and 14% at constant currency. Before we move to R&D Solutions' net new business, let me remind you of how we are reporting bookings this year. Consistent with last quarter, we are reporting backlog, including pass-through, which we will report quarterly, so it's easy for you to derive our quarterly bookings. In addition, for this year, we will continue to report net new business on an LTM basis, excluding pass-through. This allows you to assess our new business strength versus the peer group, many of whom are still reporting on the old accounting standard, and will also help you to compare our 2018 bookings to prior years.  On this basis, our LTM contracted net new business at June 30, 2018, was $4.88 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.1%. We are very pleased to see the beginning of the acceleration of our bookings. And now if we include reimbursed expenses, closing backlog at June 30, 2018, was $15.73 billion, and the amount of backlog that we expect to convert to revenue over the next 12 months is approximately $4.6 billion. Now turning to first half profit. First half adjusted EBITDA of $1,080,000,000 grew 11.2% reported and 10.8% at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 50 basis points reported and 80 basis points at constant currency. GAAP net income was $130 million and GAAP diluted EPS was $0.62. Adjusted net income of $555 million grew 12.6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.63 grew 21.8%.  Before we review guidance, let's spend just a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $879 million and debt was $10.7 billion, resulting in net debt of about $9.8 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 5.1x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.6x. Cash flow from operating activities was $311 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $110 million, and free cash flow was $201 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased $573 million of our shares. We currently have approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  Now let's turn to 2018 guidance. We are raising our full year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue guidance has been raised for the second time since February this year. The range is now expected to be between $10.25 billion and $10.4 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5.6% to 7.2%. You should note that at current foreign exchange rates, we have lost some of the FX tailwind that was included in our previous guidance, about 30 basis points of growth or approximately $30 million. When you take this into account, we are effectively raising the guidance for the full year by over $200 million at the midpoint.  Now this increase in revenue guidance, which includes flowing through the first half beat, is coming from the three areas Ari discussed earlier, first, organic operational strength, which represents about half of the increase; second, a bit more pass-through revenue in R&D Solutions than we had anticipated, which is about 1/4 of the increase; and third, another 1/4 of the increase is due to a higher contribution from M&A. Again, this is net of the FX headwind I discussed earlier and assumes current foreign currency rates remain in effect for the rest of the year.  Adjusted EBITDA guidance has also been raised, and we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.17 billion and $2.23 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 10.9%. The increase is due solely to organic strength on the revenue line as pass-through comes with 0 profit and acquisitions typically come with very little profit. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised to reflect higher adjusted EBITDA as well as a lower expected tax rate. We now expect full year diluted EPS to be between $5.35 and $5.55, which represents year-over-year growth of 17.6% to 22%. Our adjusted book tax rate is now expected to be approximately 23%.  Now let's review guidance for the third quarter. Assuming foreign currency rates remain at current levels through the end of the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.55 billion and $2.6 billion, which represents growth of 3.4% to 5.4%. This growth is lower than the annual growth rate in our full year guidance, and this is mostly due to a lower FX impact in the second half compared to the first half. In fact, we are expecting an FX headwind to year-over-year growth in the second half. We also expect a lower contribution from tuck-in acquisitions. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $540 million and $560 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.35 and $1.42. So in summary, we delivered another quarter of consistent, strong results with revenue and profit numbers that came in above our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points at constant currency. Adjusted diluted EPS grew over 25%. We raised full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Our tech team continues to drive new business with significant OCE SaaS wins in the quarter. R&D Solutions LTM, contracted services net new business grew over 20%. And we executed $573 million of share repurchase in the quarter, bringing the total post-merger repurchases to $4.3 billion at an average price of $85.23. And with that, I will ask the operator to open up the lines for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Rivka Goldwasser: So Ari, in the past, you talked about the revenue growth inflection point being in kind of like the second half of 2019. But based on the demand that you are seeing and the wins this quarter, does this change your view on the revenue trajectory?
Ari Bousbib: Ricky, thanks for your question. No. Look, we're still predicting the same uptick in revenue growth that we've been talking to you about since the time of the merger. We simply feel a lot better, and I think it gives us a lot more comfort that this, certainly, this inflection can be achieved then. Again, we are seeing a little bit faster, little bit -- again, I don't want to inflate the narrative here, but little bit faster revenue burn, a little bit. And so could we do a little bit earlier? Again, the middle of '19 is not that far, it's less than a year away. So thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: First one on OCE. I'm just curious, what is the average duration of contracts that your biggest competitor has with their clients? I think they have, I think, by some estimates, maybe 60% of the marketplace there. And I'm just curious, how long do you think you could cycle through bids against your competitor and maybe show some more of that hit rate that you just talked about?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks, Eric. Yes, the market share, by some accounts, is even greater than 60%, maybe inching to 80%. But certainly if you look at large pharma. And so for us, the win here that I talked about, we are -- hopefully, we'll be able to talk more about it and say who it is shortly. But I think it's most impressive because it's a top 5 pharma and a global rollout. But the duration of the contracts, typically, it's at 3 years to 5 years. But what happens is there's a significant implementation phase that could be a year or more as we roll out the technology over many countries. And it could be 100 countries sometimes, and therefore, it takes time to roll out. It's a significant investment on the part of the sponsor or the client and on the part of the provider. And therefore, the switching costs can be very high. So sometimes, the value proposition has to be really, really compelling to switch. And it is why we are extremely pleased here.
Eric Coldwell: I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're really happy with where you are, you've got good momentum. But we probably shouldn't get too far ahead of our skates on projecting share capture over the next year or so because this will be a multi-year RFP process as well as bigger clients needing time to implement. Is that a fair approach?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, it's actually a good, fair approach. But if I can just frame that for you. Our long-stated goal here is to grow our technology business. We are a technology company in aggregate. We actually have more revenue and more products than some of those highly valued technology companies out there. We have, in our Technology & Analytics business, a large, but -- $1.5 billion or so in revenue data business, which is highly attractive and underlies what we do, but it's a 0 growth business. And so that's why our mid-single-digit revenue growth has been, quarter in, quarter out, the pattern of growth for that business in aggregate. The technology business obviously grows double digits. We are making those investments, and we anticipate that, that mid-single-digit trajectory will inch up as technology gets rolled up. But you are correct, it's not for the next year.
Operator: And our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wright: The momentum in next-gen awards seem to be continuing here, and I appreciate all the metrics that you did give earlier. I guess, can you speak to the overall win rate with next-gen? And as it relates to the nature of those awards, have you been able to establish some more meaningful preferred partnerships where you've been actually able to displace existing strategic partners?
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Erin. Look, personally, as a matter of principle, I just don't like this concept of preferred partnerships, just to answer part of your question. The reason why sponsors went to preferred partnership and established this sort of, forgive me, Erin, here, but oligopoly of sorts, where you've got half a dozen or 10 CROs competing for a finite amount of work at large pharma. And essentially, because it was a procurement gain with very little differentiation, and because it's so complex to go through an RFP, you can't just waste time dealing with 8, 9 or 10 CROs every time you have a trial. And so you need to kind of preselect the 2 or 3 ones that you are going to do business with most likely. So therefore, the model evolved towards this preferred. I want us to win every single time, whether we preferred or not preferred, on the back of very superior capabilities, which we believe next generation of clinical development offers. So that's with respect to preferred. Now having said that, I can't really speak or disclose some, but there are, and you're probably aware of this, you guys all track this industry very well. There are, as we speak, a number of processes with many large pharma companies that are reviewing the status of their preferred partnership. And I can tell you that we are in the running to substitute prior preferred partners. Again, it doesn't move the needle for us. We are winning, by the way, at -- with next-generation offering at clients that have other people as preferred partners. So it just happens to be a higher hurdle for us, though we are also winning there in some instances. With respect to the first part of your question, our experienced decision rate, and we track that very clearly, it's about -- the decision rate, the positive decision rate for us is in the 40s, in the 40s percent for regular win rate. Or maybe the win rate is usually that 1/3, if you will. And for next generation, it's probably double that, right? It's in the 60s.
Erin Wright: That's great. And if I could just ask a follow-up here. It's more of a broader question on the regulatory landscape. And the scrutiny we've seen on drug pricing of late across the new administration, and particularly, in the U.S., I guess, is what I'm referring to. And have you seen any customers respond, if at all, from a clinical trial perspective, to the regulatory landscape? And more broadly, I guess, how are your initiatives aligned with some of the new initiatives and efforts from, for instance, Scott Gottlieb with the FDA?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Erin. That's actually a fundamental, strategic question because the -- our clients, when they are looking at whether to put a molecule through a trial, obviously, there's a lot that comes into play. But the economics of the drug, once approved, are a major factor, and the expected pricing as well. I gave the example of the big win for this in our real-world business for our -- that single-arm model that we are building with predictive analytics. The point here is to try to anticipate the pricing based on the demonstrability of the effectiveness of the drug and using advanced, enriched patient-level data. So the point here is that the clients are asking themselves very sophisticated questions. And we believe that we have unique capabilities to bring to bear, and it's proving itself out in the marketplace, in order to demonstrate and help clients support the pricing that they want to achieve to make the drug reasonable and meaningful to develop. So you're right, but the question is more on the strategic level. I don't think there are -- the question is a strategic level, and it's molecule by molecule, it's drug by drug. Of course, the question comes up also for drugs in the market, that would constitute the bread-and-butter and the main growth engine of our real-world business. Thank you, Erin.
Operator: And our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore.
Ross Muken: So maybe on the bookings side. I think what I got from your commentary, Ari, is you're pretty pleased sort of with the share dynamic. I guess, as we think about some of the areas we're making inroads, how do you see a difference kind of in small and emerging biotech versus maybe where you were 12 or 24 months ago? And then in FSP versus kind of full-service, what trend are you sort of seeing in the lines there?
Ari Bousbib: It's a great question. If you recall, when -- at the time of the merger, we kind of took a step back and looked at the strategy of the legacy Quintiles organization and concluded that we needed to be the leader in the marketplace across the board. We couldn't just pick and choose who we wanted to work with, under what terms, with what margins, what type of products, et cetera, et cetera. We said at the time, we want to address 100% of the market, admittedly, with different types of offerings and a more segmented approach to the market. And that meant that we needed to go after the EBP segment a lot more aggressively. We realized that, that was the engine of growth, and that is proving itself out. We continue to see extremely good bookings traction. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are seeing 60% growth in this quarter in terms of EBP bookings. We're doing work with a lot of clients we've never even heard of in the past within the clinical development organization. And by the way, these sometimes are large trials. Just because they are small companies, they're, as you know, are becoming extremely well funded. In fact, I might say, the next generation of clinical development offering is also very appealing. I think about 60% of our next-gen awards in the second quarter were with EBP clients. And so that's for EBP. With respect to FSP, you are correct as well. The company as a whole had walked away, literally, from resourcing work. And we -- again, we said, that is not possible because, again, you cannot pick and choose. The very same client can decide to have both a full-service clinical trial with core clinical and all the capabilities and all the bells and whistles for a particular trial, and at the same time, in parallel, do a resourcing type of outsourcing deal. And the client wants to do both. And at some point in time, they might go from one to the other. And so to just say, "Well, no, I will do this, but I won't do that," that's just not the kind of relationships that we want to have with our clients as partners, long-term partners. And therefore, we've changed our approach. And we've seen a healthy uptick in the amount of FSP work as well. And again, that comes with different constraints and different requirements. It's lower margin. It's, as you know, for the most part, does not have pass-through with it. So it has an impact. In fact, if I might point you to the fact that because our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter is greater on a 606 basis than on a 605 basis, you can derive from that, that the bookings "quality" is actually very good in the quarter, meaning we've got a lot of full-service work here. We also have a lot of FSP, but we have a lot more full-service work. So again, it's a mix. You can't just say the world is going FSP or the world is going -- we've got both, and we've got to play on both fronts. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC.
George Hill: I guess, Ari, as we think about the growth in next-gen, are you able to kind of parse out for us how much of the growth in bookings comes from incremental volume and how much of it comes from the price premium that you guys were able to charge for next-gen? And I guess, kind of walk us through how we should think about that mix as the next-gen business continues to grow.
Ari Bousbib: George, thanks for the question. We'd love to get price premium on next generation, and we believe we deserve a price premium. However, I can assure you, there is 0, 0, pricing here. And if anything, there is, perhaps, a negative which is what one would have expected. And the reason for that is we are, again, still in the initial stages of deploying these capabilities with our clients. And as always, it's highly competitive. We are going deliberately after clients that have preferred partnerships with others. We want to demonstrate that we can do that. And the hurdle is higher because our -- it's still a highly competitive market, and people won't hesitate to drop and do work at very little margin in order not to be displaced because being displaced is a big deal. Switching costs are very high. Relationships are very established. So far, we're not even trying, by the way. Right now, we're just deploying the capabilities. And over time, what we want to do is, as we said many times, is transition the model, where we want to make this a more expensive proposition for the clients, on the contrary, because they'll have more predictable timelines, faster patient enrollment, faster approvals. As a result, they will get the product in the marketplace faster, and the value from that is tremendously higher than any cost savings they will get from a little discount on the pricing. And we might then move to a model that, so far, is essentially cost-plus to a model that has more elements of fixed pricing, which, in turn, allows us to work on our cost structure and deliver better quality at a lower cost.
George Hill: Okay. Well, then, you kind of hit my follow-up question, which was going to be, were any of the bookings in the quarter -- were a significant portions of the bookings fixed cost contracts? And the progress there.
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Well, I think we are increasing. That's all I should say. But we are almost half.
Operator: And our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson: I want to start with a guidance question. Understand the FX impact, but EBITDA is only coming up $15 million off the $175 million top line increase. Can you maybe call out how much of the top line raise was reimbursement expense that are kind of coming through at 0 margin? Why isn't EBITDA coming up more, I guess, is the key part.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I think we mentioned, it's in -- do you want to speak to [indiscernible] of the...
Michael McDonnell: Yes, yes, I'd be happy to do that. Yes. So if you look at the increase in revenue guidance, Tycho, it's $175 million at the midpoint, really, over $200 million when you factor in the loss of the $30 million of currency benefit that we had talked about last quarter. So I'll break that down into 3 pieces. One is just organic, and I'll call that about half of the $200 million. And that does have drop-through of EBITDA with it. So that, call it, around $100 million gets you EBITDA, incremental EBITDA, and we raised the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance by around $15 million. So that drop-through makes sense. The other 2 pieces, the pass-throughs, which make up about half of -- 1/4 of the $200 million; and the M&A, which is the other 1/4, they really don't drop through much in the way of incremental profit, particularly the M&A. These are smaller companies that, initially, when we buy them, before we can integrate them fully, they don't have much EBITDA associated with them. So really, it's the organic piece that creates the incremental EBITDA only.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I might add, we continue to make investments in our business. And that obviously -- and we continue, of course, to take cost out. So there is an offset. Again, up until the end of 2019 we anticipate continuing to make those investments. That has been the message we've communicated to you. So if we stopped investing in next-generation capabilities and in the OCE stuff, then yes, margin would be much higher, the drop-through would be higher, and it would be, hopefully, after that. But we are investing for growth. By the way, when we win a CRM -- I'm sorry, an OCE technology contract, there is a little bit of headwind to our margin in the first phases because the first phase is implementation. That carries basically no margin. We spend a lot of money and it's more labor-intensive as we work with the client to sometimes take out the existing CRM and put our stuff in. And obviously, we don't want to make this a burden for the clients, so that's really no margin generally or very little margin and before we can get into the much more attractive SaaS margin in the long term. So again, the deployments and the wins do come with a little bit of headwind in our mix.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, that's helpful. And then two quick follow-ups. You had a question on FDA earlier. Separately, has there been any residual impact from the remediation measures related to the FDA data issue? I'm just curious if you can comment on that since it came up there.
Ari Bousbib: The short answer is no. None. We were -- obviously, the FDA is a very important and critical constituency for us. We have extremely good relationships with the FDA. And by the way, I might add, many, many other government agencies that use our services or data or analytics. We have ongoing interaction with the FDA, continue to support their work. Obviously, we regret there was an error in that kilogram conversion metric for the exact amount of active ingredient in one of the national market research audits in the U.S. for fentanyl patches. And again, that was corrected. We're continuing to work with the FDA to address their needs, and obviously, to improve our communication. This issue had 0 impact with any of our clients. And if I might add, that metric at issue, which, by the way, I don't think I know of any other service provider in the U.S. that has the capabilities, and even remotely, to furnish that type of analytics to the FDA or anyone else. And it's used by 1.7% of clients in that particular service, which brings it down to 0-point-something percent of our clients worldwide. So again, we do not expect this to have any impact whatsoever on our business or financial results.
Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then, I guess, separately on just data integrity. I mean, how do you handicap risk around kind of data theft and hacking? I'm thinking about LabCorp's issues that they kind of experienced recently. Have you had to kind of step up your security measures?
Andrew Markwick: George, after this, I think we're going to have to move to somebody else in the queue as well, just so we can get -- sorry, can you repeat the question, George, as well?
Tycho Peterson: Just a question on data integrity issues. I mean, given what LabCorp experienced, I mean, how much of a concern is that?
Ari Bousbib: Well, obviously, cybersecurity and the risk of hacking and all that stuff, that's -- it's a concern. And if you -- people ask me, "What keeps you up at night?" I'd say that's it. We do everything we can, and we have all kinds of measures, as you can imagine. But it is a risk that we manage and control, and we have a lot of redundancies and we are a global company. And we've been at this for a long time, as you can imagine. But yes, that's an area of big investments that you can't see and we don't talk about. But obviously, it's a part of our infrastructure. We are, as we've said in other meetings and interaction with you, a significant technology company.
Operator: And our next question is from Sandy Draper with SunTrust.
Alexander Draper: A lot of my questions have been asked already, but maybe just a follow-up to the comment, I think, I believe, Mike made about a little bit expected less -- or fewer revenue or fewer contributions from tuck-in acquisitions. And just any thoughts. Is that -- are valuations getting high? Just normal lumpiness? Your guys' appetite is changing? Just any thoughts around what's sort of driving this. Or is it really nothing we should really be focusing on for the longer term?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. Thanks. No, look, acquisitions, we've always said, we are very low at CapEx. We don't invest a lot, we -- there's no constraints. We would invest in a minute if we had an attractive capital expenditure. We felt, in many cases, that it was better to acquire innovation at early stages. Sometimes, we were right, sometimes we were wrong. But we make those bets, and it's our way of investing. It's just accounted for differently because it's not the capital expenditure, it's an acquisition. But that's -- it's a tool now in our strategy and in our innovation investments. It's binary. We have a very healthy pipeline, always, as we should. And we look at 100 potential acquisitions and we buy 1. So it's hard to predict. And yes, you are correct. Valuations, we have moved away from things we would have liked to buy because of valuations. With even -- if it's only a small number, we just are trying to be extremely disciplined. Do you want one more question?
Alexander Draper: That's very helpful.
Andrew Markwick: I think, yes, let's take one more question -- and then -- as we're coming up on the top of the hour, we'll end it after one more.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays.
Jack Meehan: I was hoping you could elaborate on what you're seeing in just mid-cap biotech. I think I heard you added 150 new customers to start the year. It's obviously been really healthy on the IPO front. Just what are you doing differently to win business? And maybe just elaborate on that would be great.
Ari Bousbib: Okay, thanks. I mean, the 150 number includes large pharma as well. Now there aren't that many large pharma companies out there to begin with, but it does include large pharma as well. Although the bulk, you are correct, are small EBP or midsize. What are we doing differently? We've been talking about this change, the go-to-market model, leverage the historical IMS distributed presence around the world, so relationships at the local level. It is a large number of midsized pharma companies in Italy, in Hungary and in Asia with the legacy IMS organization, extremely good relationships, C-Suite relationships. We've got -- the people funding those biotechs are essentially go-to-market model that has been changed. As you know, we've mentioned that we've invested a lot in developing and training and recruiting a sales force that was more proactive, the way we go-to-market. And again, our capabilities, which we believe are second to none in this space, with the combination of analytics and technology that heretofore haven't been big part. I mean, everyone was talking about technology, but the type of technology that were brought to bear in clinical trial is, frankly, antiquated and obsolete and essentially kind of put on a computer page, was on paper, essentially. And then we're trying to change that model and really increase the power of what we do with more precision, more focus on efficiency, on process optimization. Again, whether it is the leveraging of analytics and technology in our next generation of clinical development, whether it is the development of mobile apps for our CRAs, whether it is the e-consent tools, all of that in combination when you present that to a client, and they are open to considering it, and they can see the benefits to their business. It takes time. It takes a lot of people, even internally, we had to get ourselves to that level, okay? There's still people here that want to do business the way it was done. And so change, it takes time. And we are all very sorry that it is taking time. I would like it to be overnight, but we are very pleased that here we are, a little bit over 1.5 years after the merger, and we are beginning to see the green shoots that we've been talking about and expecting.  So thank you all for your good questions. And I'll turn it to Andrew for concluding remarks.
Andrew Markwick: Yes, we're at the top of the hour, then, so I think we'll end the call. Thank you for taking the time to join us again today. And we look forward to speaking again with everyone on our Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. And we'll be available for the rest of day for any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, everyone, have a great rest of your day, and you may disconnect your line.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Markwick - VP of IR Ari Bousbib - Chairman and CEO Mike McDonnell - EVP and CFO Nick Childs - SVP, Financial Planning and Analysis
Analysts: Sandy Draper - SunTrust Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs John Kreger - William Blair Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Jack Meehan - Barclays Ross Muken - Evercore ISI
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the IQVIA First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 02, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Tina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. Nick is new to this call, and he joined the company a couple of months ago to lead our financial planning and analysis function. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards which is discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings call. We finished 2017 with strong momentum, and I am pleased to report we continued this momentum in the first quarter of 2018. Once again, we delivered strong financial results with revenue and profit numbers above our guidance ranges. Let's review the quarter. As we enter our second full year following the merger, we're now able to see our financial performance compared to the same base as last year. I would also like to acknowledge the extraordinary work of our finance organization they have been able to ASC 606 numbers to a high degree of precision for both 2017 and 2018. I am pleased that we were already able to bridge the change in accounting standard first out of the gate in last quarter's earnings release and we are able to provide full transparency into growth under the new standards today and going forward. The team delivered very good results once again. First quarter revenue of 2,563,000,000 borrowers grew 8.6% and was higher than our guidance range. The revenue bid was driven by three roughly equal components. First, organic operational upside which we are flowing through to our increased full year revenue guidance. I will note that this organic upside was the entire driver of the adjusted EBITDA bid as well. Second, the phasing of pass-through in our R&D Solutions segment which came in at about $390 million for the quarter and a little higher than we had anticipated which is entirely due to timing. And third, an FX data win versus our guidance range which we are also flowing through to our increased full year revenue guidance. You should note that while FX have revenue in the first quarter, it had no material impact on profit. The primary reason for this is the mix of locations where R&D work is performed. Also, we do have some currency hedging below adjusted EBITDA which upsets any residual FX benefit at the adjusted EPS level. From a segment perspective, first quarter Commercial Solutions revenue grew 14.1% reported and 9.3% at constant FX which is again better than we had expected. R&D Solutions grew 8.1% reported and 5.8% at constant FX also better than what we had expected. Integrated engagement services revenue was down 9% reported and 12.8% at constant FX and that's as we have expected. Now as you know, we did several acquisitions last year primarily of technology assets and primarily in the Commercial Solutions segment. So we would like to provide more color on the revenue impact on acquisitions on this call. At constant currency, Commercial Solutions grew 9.3% of which about 4% was organic. In the R&D Solutions segment, constant currency growth was 5.8% and a gain about 4% was also organic. So acquisitions represented over half of the constant currency growth in Commercial Solutions and at about one-third of the constant currency growth in R&D Solutions. Now acquisitions can be hard to predict and while we did several last year, we did very little during the first quarter. We spent $20 million which did not contribute meaningfully to first quarter revenue. Separately, you may have seen that we took a minority stake in Quintiles, the healthcare data and analytics company which also happened to be a $20 million investment. We are excited about the opportunity to join Memorial Sloan Kettering and other prestigious institutions as we all look to address the value of cancer care through real world technology enabled analytics. Turning to profit, adjusted EBITDA of $547 million grew 8.5% again beating our expectations. Compared to our guidance range the beat was primarily driven by the drop through from strong organic performance on the revenue line. As we know and as I mentioned earlier FX had no impact on EBITDA and pass-throughs have not impact on EBITDA either. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.34 grew about 20% relative to our guidance range the beat was driven almost entirely by our strong operational performance and one thing of various plus and minus items below the adjusted EBITDA line. Now I’d like to provide more color on our margins. As you know, we've said all along that our intention is to grow our profit faster than our revenue and expand our margins. This past quarter we did indeed have solid margin expansion in the core business at constant currency. Revenue conversion contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion, and all cost takeout actions contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. As you know, we committed to a cost synergy target of $200 million run rate savings exiting 2019 and we are still on track to achieve this goal. Now in addition to the national headwinds from annual wage inflation, we are also making investments in the business to accelerate growth including increased go-to-market resources, data scientist to support our R&D next generation capabilities, specialty data panel especially in the emerging markets, investments to replatform our global CRM and MCM capabilities, and of course technology acquisitions which have a dilutive impact on our margins. All these items plus and minus net to 40 basis points of margin expansion at constant currency in the quarter. So in summary, we’re very excited by the operational momentum in the business. Before I close my remarks and turn it over to Mike, let me mention some of the most important wins in our key businesses. In our tech business, you may have seen that record [indiscernible] Italian midsize pharma company signed a seven-year deal to deploy our orchestrated customer engagement or OCE SaaS offering in 17 countries. Note, this was a highly competitive win and it was awarded to us based on our highly differentiated capabilities including a tool that utilizes our official intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our commercial operations. Our R&D Solutions business continues to gain momentum. We now have contracted backlog including pass-throughs which exceeds $15 billion. We continue to see strong traction with our next generation capabilities and now have approximately $1.6 billion of R&D awards since the merger and this is excluding the pass-throughs. These awards all utilize our advance technology and analytical driven approach to clinical development. For example, during the quarter we won a large project with the U.S. biopharma client. The deal was won through our ability to identify high-performing sites for patients with a serious autoimmune disorder. This project will cover series of Phase 3 studies. I also want to mention that the R&D team is working hard to advance our cutting edge virtual trial solution. We’re having very encouraging discussion with clients and have a large pipeline of virtual trial opportunities. I look forward to reporting more as we make further progress in this area. We also had great wins in our real world insights business and example includes an innovative deal with a leading U.S. biotech company. This novel synthetic clinical trial will compare a single arm population to a real world data cohort competitor. Instead of setting up multiple competitor arms within the trial, we will benchmark the trial outcomes to retrospective real world data. Importantly, this study will be used to support a regulatory label expansion. Our significant domain expertise to design this innovative studies access to the right real world data and collaboration with regulators all are critical to this important win. With that, let me turn it over Mike McDonnell our Chief Financial Officer to take you through the financials in more detail.
Mike McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. As Ari mentioned, we had a strong start to 2018. Let’s review the financials which I remind you are now on an ASC 606 basis for all periods presented which includes 2017. First quarter revenue of $2,563,000,000 grew 8.6% reported and 5.2% at constant currency. Commercial Solutions revenue up 985 million grew 14.1% reported and 9.3% at constant currency. R&D solutions revenue of $1,365,000,000 grew 8.1% at actual FX rates and 5.8% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue up 213 million declined 9% at actual FX rates and 12.8% at constant currency. And now turning to profit, first quarter adjusted EBITDA of 547 million grew 8.5% reported and 7.4% at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 10 basis points on a reported basis but expanded 40 basis points at constant currency. As Ari mentioned we, had solid margin expansion in the core business driven by revenue conversion and cost takeout which was partially offset by the many investments we continue to make in the business. GAAP net income was $69 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.32. Adjusted net income of 285 million grew 8%, growth was primarily driven by stronger adjusted EBITDA below the line benefited from a lower tax provision due primarily to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense from higher debt levels. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.34 grew 19.6%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher adjusted net income which I just discussed, as well as the lower share count year-over-year. On this basis, our LTM contracted net new business at March 31, 2018 was 4.72 billion representing year over growth of over 15%. If you focus on the quarterly bookings contracted net new bookings in the first quarter of 2018 were up 17.5% versus contracted net new bookings in the first quarter of 2017, again on the old basis. I know the industry is still calculating the old book-to-bill ratio. We have suggested in the past this metric may not be as useful or meaningful to predict future growth. However, if you were to calculate on the old basis, you would derive an LTM book-to-bill ratio that is around 1.26 or so. And for the quarter on the old basis, it would be in the same range and by the way if you were curious and wanted to calculate the book-to-bill ratio under the old, old method based on awards, the number would be well north of that. Now back to the new standard, this book-to-bill metric is even less useful or meaningful because it is less precise. We will not report net new business or book-to-bill metric inclusive of pass-through going forward. However, you will be able to calculate them by taking the difference in backlog and backing out revenue. I want to draw your attention to a number of reasons why again this metric may not be as meaningful under the new standard. First, [indiscernible] is not finalized at the same time as contract signature and although we have a baseline number at the time of contract signature, it does not have the same degree of precision at service bookings. It is also subject to more fluctuation than services bookings during the life of the contract. Second, business line and therapy areas within the industry have varying levels or pass-through. Functional service provider, data safety science and regulatory and the lab all have little pass-through. Therefore, a swing in new business between this type of work and full clinical could significantly swing the book-to-bill in a given quarter. And third, we're expecting pass-through revenue to decline in 2018 as we indicated when we provided our guidance last quarter. Therefore, the inclusion the past done bookings could inflate the book-to-bill metric. For example, a higher mix of pass-through revenue with lower mix of pass-through net new business would deflate bookings metrics. A lower mix of pass-through revenue with a higher mix of pass-through net new business will inflate bookings metrics. Finally, as a reminder, pass-through has zero impact on profit over the life of the contract. Taking all this into account, let’s turn to backlog including reimbursed expenses. Closing backlog at March 31, 2018 was $15.16 billion. To assist you in building your models, we have also recast December 31, 2017 backlog to include reimbursed expenses which is $14.84 billion. Before we turn to guidance, let’s spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $960 million and debt was $10.4 billion resulting in net debt of about $9.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 5.1 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, net of cash our leverage ratio was 4.6 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $182 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $88 million and free cash flow was $94 million which compares favorably to the negative $22 million we reported in the first quarter of 2017. As it is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was significantly impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. As Ari mentioned earlier, toward the end of the quarter we repurchased $86 million worth of our shares in the open market. We currently have approximately $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Let's turn to 2018 guidance inclusive of the adoption of ASC 606. We are raising our revenue guidance by $50 million to flow through the first quarter currency benefit and the organic operational upside. We now expect revenue to be between $10.05 billion and $10.25 billion. We told you last quarter that under ASC 606 pass-through revenue is expected to dampen 2018 R&D solutions revenue growth by about 3.5 to 4 percentage points and total revenue growth by about 2 percentage points. We're still tracking to these estimates. This revenue guidance assumes current foreign currency rates remain in effect through the remainder of the year. Now the FX fluctuation had little impact on our profit metrics. We are reaffirming adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS guidance which is still expected to be between $2.15 billion and $2.22 billion for adjusted EBITDA and between $5.20 and $5.45 for adjusted diluted EPS which represents year-over-year growth of 14% to 20%. We're also reaffirming our full-year tax rate guidance which is expected to be approximately 24% for the adjusted book tax rate and approximately 17% for the adjusted cash tax rate. As in previous quarters, we will also provide guidance for the coming quarter assuming foreign currency rates remain at current levels through the end of the second quarter we expect revenue to be between $2.47 billion and $2.52 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $510 million and $530 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.17 and $1.24. This adjusted diluted EPS range represents growth year-over-year of between 13.6% and 20.4%. In summary, we entered the year with solid momentum. We delivered strong financial results with revenue and profit numbers above our guidance range. Adjusted diluted EPS grew about 20%. R&D Solutions, LMP contracted services net new business grew 14.5%, R&D Solutions' contracted back log now exceeds $15 billion. Our next generation R&D capabilities continue to see success in the market with approximately $1.6 billion of post-merger awards, and our commercial team continues to drive new business wins with our OCE SaaS based offering. And with that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sandy Draper, SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Sandy Draper: One, first just start out with a quick housekeeping and I apologize if you have answered because I jumped on the call a tiny bit late. Did you give an adjusted backlog to exclude the pass-through revenue or you’re just going to go forward always including the pass-through revenue.
Ari Bousbib : Yes, we did not give that Sandy, it's Mike speaking. We tracked obviously 605 and 606 throughout the year, last year, and we fully have implemented 606 at this point and that’s the basis upon which we are going to report backlog. We did give a 12/31/17 backlog under 606 for comparative purposes.
Mike McDonnell: And I think in addition to that, I mean that’s important thing here is 606 backlog or whether its 606 revenue. We have given you next 12 months backlog from that metric as well, which you will see on the edge of the slides in the presentation, which is now expected to be $4.6 billion. So I think that should help you in terms of your modeling the rest of the year.
Sandy Draper: And the next question, and I know you guys probably have answered this a lot and been tried of, but it will be helpful just to get the updated view. There is certainly some level of concern out there just across the industry about pharma M&A. Can you just walk us through again sort of how you view the near term impact and any exposure to consolidation, and then on both sides of the business and how expose you would be and then what you think about longer term impact of form a consolidation? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib : Look this is not the new phenomena. It has been happening for decades in industry so both legacy businesses have a lot of experience dealing with these phases of consolidation. First you should know that we are very well diversified provider of services to the pharma industry. There is probably no one out there that provide as much stuff to pharma as we do. We've got offerings in multiple countries around the world, and there is no one really that does not buy anything from us. Customer concentration as a result over that is very low. I think our last client is less than 10% of revenue, actually the highest is maybe half of that. On the commercial side, it depends on the nature of the combination. The area of our business that would be theatrically most affected by merger is the data business because obviously we are the largest supplier of that offering and so it's very likely that when two companies merge, they were both using our data. And again, here the impact on the data side will depend on the nature of the combination. Through the degree that needs our complementary therapies and complementary pipelines, then the effect is de minimis because there is no overlap. To the degree that they are exactly overlapping usually those mergers don't take place. They are regulatory opposition to those and so historically we’ve modeled this in the past and $2 of spend doesn’t become $1 of spend. And I am talking about the data side here. Over several years potentially the impact goes from $2 to $1.8 that’s only on the information side. The rest of the business is virtually not affected. Again on the R&D Solutions it's a backlog driven business, there is good visibility into future revenues, we sometimes actually those mergers may be an opportunity to serve more depending on who is the surviving preferred supplier and bear in mind the legacy Quintiles acquisitions was locked out of many large accounts. So it has happened in the past that an acquisition actually has enabled us through penetrate decline that we have locked out from before. So again overall we feel good about older merges that have taken place, that have been talked about and do not expect any noticeable impact on our guidance.
Sandy Draper: And just final one and I will jump back in the queue. Lower level of share rate purchases in the quarter obviously than we seen in the past, that just some normal timing and maybe that the lower cash flow, or was there any change in profit that you thought about share repurchase? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: No, there is no change, absolutely no root. If you go back to the entire past year, this is consistent with what we have done. We have done a $100 million plus or minus of open market purchases quarter in and quarter out. The difference is when there was a secondary offering by our sponsors, then we generally took the opportunity to participate in this secondary offering and buy $200 to $153,000 million worth of stock in that secondary. But that hasn’t happened in the past quarter our existing PE shareholders do not - do a secondary in the quarter and so we didn't have that opportunity. So there is a open market purchases I think we bought $86 million, I guess last quarter we bought $130 million, quarter before 170 something, the quarter before 78, I am talking about open market purchases and bear in mind we couldn't buy anything before the earnings release, which was February 14, 2018, and then we precluded from buying for at least some quarterly to the week after the earnings release. So the open window is relatively short because obviously long before the end of the quarter we also - out of the market. So, a small window and consistent with the past. We will continue to repurchase if our sponsors choose to go second in the future, we will look to participate and there is no change whatsoever in our intent to repurchase there, we still have $1.6 billion of share authorization and we intend to use it whether in the next 12 or 16 or 18 months or so couple of years certainly we will use that authorization.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: I am curious kind of where we stand in terms of the cost saving plan, are you ahead of plan on that front and just a broader integration process. So does it continue to be on track or you need some meaningful accomplishment, I guess stage, but what are the next steps in integration and cost savings progress. I guess where it stands now? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: I think we said that we expected to be on the run rate of $200 million of cost stack out executed by the end of 2019. That is end of year three after the closure of the merger. The way synergies happened as you know it's kind of - its an accelerating ramp, so it's usually the 20% or so is in the first year and then another 30% or so the second year, and then the last 50% in the third year and that was our plan. I think we are a little ahead of schedule that is at the end of the first year and of last year therefore, our run rate was more than 20% more in the 30% or so. And I expect by the end of this year we’ll be more than two-thirds done with our cost takeout actions. So, we are a little ahead of schedule and perhaps that is what you see in the - I show the chart that shows 120 bps of margin expansion at content FX from integration savings, as well as the regular operational efficiency work and cost takeout actions. So, we are well on track and again and ahead of schedule.
Erin Wright: And it was another nice step up growth bookings associated with Next-Gen offering can you characterize can kind of what you're seeing or where you’re seeing the most traction in terms of customer tights and how that’s generally resonating that would be great? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, look EBP is segment is where we see the most traction. Our booking is generally in the segments have increased dramatically. I think we historically - we’re doing okay with the EBP segment but with the Next-Gen capability we’ve accelerated our penetration of the segment I would attribute to most of the growth in our bookings and you seen that we’ve had excellent record booking quarters and an accelerating trend our NNB on the old basis is up 15% year-over-year and we’re very pleased with our traction in the market. I think it's almost or about 70% of our bookings in the quarter were EBP. And obviously Next-Gen is a part of that.
Operator: One moment please for our next question and it comes from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Jones: Just wanted to ask one on the EBITDA margin guidance for 2Q little bit below what we would expected especially in light of the revenue in the quarter and also the better revenue guidance. Is there anything specific worth calling out there or there are some spending items or anticipated expenses that we should be thinking about for 2Q. And then you for the back half of the years or anything else that you would you flag as far as the cadence of the EBITDA margin expectation?
Ari Bousbib: I don’t know what really you mean by lower margin and expectation. I think we showed here for the second quarter margin expansion of how much Andrew we have it can you get me that. We see significant margin expansion because revenue growth we guide through 4.9% to 7% which is pretty strong 5% to 7% and then adjusted EBITDA growing at 9.2% to 13.5%. So that’s like more than the 1.5 times growth on EBITDA versus revenue growth that we had guided to which is like a range of 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion which is I don’t know I mean you expected more than that, but I think I don’t know may companies in our space that are expanding margin at a 100 basis points. I think perhaps what you're referring to is the absolute dollar number that you guys had out there for second quarter may have been a little bit higher than what - that the range we provided here which is $510 million to $530 million. And the reason for that you had no way to know what was second Q we provided 2017 recast on an ASC 606 basis at the end of last quarter so we didn’t give you the quarters, if you look in this release in the back of the earnings as we have Q2 2017 recast on an ASC 606 basis and you can see there that the growth and you can see the percentage. So maybe what you want to compare is the growth of EBITDA under the new standard versus the growth of EBITDA under the old standard that you had in your model. I think we’re also providing and you’ll get this right after the call. We recast every quarter of 2017 under the new basis that way you’ll have better ways to compare.
Andrew Markwick: You better find that Bob in the appendix of the slide that’s connected on the website.
Ari Bousbib: So, again very strong actually margin expansion even greater than in the first quarter in our guidance.
Robert Jones: I was always talking specifically more about the margin sequentially looked like its down 50 bps I’m sure you noticed obviously the EBITDA that you guided to was below where the street was not that on a year-over-year basis wasn’t impressive which is - clearly was maybe a cadence same where but the street was not modeling EBITDA across the next three quarters the way that you’re now guiding to it would seem.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I think Andrew you want to take…
Andrew Markwick: I think we are seeing that Bob some of revenue be it in the first quarter is future stronger OpEx so that hasn’t got through to the EBITDA line and again the partner stronger you know in the first quarter. So, that where you’re getting a slightly weaker…
Ari Bousbib: But that would be a lower margin in the first quarter, I think Bob is saying that sequentially the margin okay let us look in that, but I think again I don't know whether the second quarter margin typically goes down or you want to take a look at that.
Andrew Markwick: There is a step down sequentially when you look at the quarterly raising for certain thing but we can take it offline Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger: Mike, given all the work you've done on the conversion to 606, what's your current thinking about what the impact of this will be on 2019. So last quarter you laid out that the kind of the earnings headwinds in 2018 but you have any thoughts about how it will impact 2019 kind of upper or down? Thank you.
Mike McDonnell: John it’s really too early to tell on that. We did lay out the earnings impact for 2018 at about 40 million which was similar to 2017, and I would say I’ll go pretty back to our midterm guide where we continue to try to grow our revenue mid single digits we’re committed over the medium term to grow our EBITDA at least 1.5 times to topline and grow our EPS double-digit. So I can give you that kind of color for the medium term but I think in terms of 2019, we’ll get deeper into our planning process several months out and we’ll obviously have more color and guidance to provide at the time.
Ari Bousbib: I mean look obviously we are asking you the same question as you know we were first in our peer group to make the conversion. We actually run all of last year under the two standards already where most of peer not of all of them are actually doing it this year. And I realize for you guys it’s a real difficult to compare across the industry because our peers are reporting kind of apples and oranges. For 2019 what we said is the mix of projects we drive a lot of the - because of pass-through the amount of pass-through and that’s the biggest issue that that people we have. The more FSP work which is less pass-throughs and then that would normally tend to dampen growth. However, and we said that this year absent the 606 conversion we would have a significantly higher growth on our revenue topline for R&D and for the company as a whole 3.5 to 4 points on R&D and a couple of points on the topline. Nevertheless, we are confident because of the strength of the pipeline that’s building because the strength of our backlog to hold in the midterm - we were confident in holding the midterm guidance that we gave in November and that Mike just reminded us of mid single-digits revenue growth in aggregate. Remember that includes IES, which is almost 150 to 200 basis points of headwind. So we feel good about the growth fight, may be you take advantage of the question here to. I don't know yet about 2019, we’ll confirm that in the year when we provide guidance for 2019, but I would not - I don’t see why it would be different. 2018 revenue guidance that we reminded you of today is 3.6% to 5.6% range on the topline and the ASC 606 impact is a range of 170 bps to 220 bps right. So if you just readjust on the old standard our guideline translates on the old standard into a growth range for this year of 5.3% to 7.8% under the old standard, which is very good and certainly above the mid single-digit balance that we have given historically. Now again, if you are focusing on our largest business and take into account the headwind from the IES declines you also know that we divested a business called Encore last year we are happy we did that. However, it was with us in the first half of the year and it’s also a headwind that we don’t have it this year. So in aggregate the headwind from IES decline and Encore is 170 bps to 190 bps for the year. So if you add that back and want to understand the underlying growth under the old standards of the R&D business and the commercial business together it’s actually 7% to 9.7% growth for this year. That’s our guidance for the commercial R&D business under the old standard. Of course we benefit from FX and I think it’s about 150 bps I think no right we said – when we gave guidance last time we said it was 100 bps we had better FX in the first quarter now it has gone back. The euro was 120 when we gave guidance last time it is back to 120. So we had about $30 million or so of FX benefit in first quarter, which we are flowing through. So it’s call it 30 bps and plus the 100 that we gave it’s a 130 bps of FX benefit included in the 7% to 9.7% revenue guidance under the old standard for the R&D and commercial solutions’ business. That’s for 2018 and we certainly hope that as we go into 2019 we will continue to sustain these growth rates or better.
John Kreger: Maybe one quick follow-up. Thank you very much for added clarity on organic growth that you gave earlier on the call. For the commercial solutions’ business I think you indicated it was around 4% organic if you could break that down a little bit. How is the data business doing versus the technology solutions versus some of the services business that you are in there? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Again nothing change, if you go back and you look at the historic IMS numbers info was kind of flattish 0%, 1%, 2% depending quarter in and quarter out and on the organic basis and the tech what we call the tech service business, which is our technology business and our services business that grows typically in the high single digits organically, 8% plus or minus 1 depending on the quarter. The older real world business at IMS, which is a database real world business grows solid double-digits and the old Quintiles business a real world business, which is more a keen to clinical trials. It’s a lot of people and it’s a longer type of studies that grew in mid single-digits also. So in aggregate the real world business is kind of double-digit. So if you put it altogether you get to this 4% organic growth on the commercial side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I just want to go over couple points just to make sure I understand them right were the next Gen type of awards 1.6 billion since the merger is that the way to understand it. And then also if you can get into a little bit of about the re-platforming of some of the technology on the salesforce.com platform and where we are with that and how that’s improving your competitive position?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, on the Next Gen yes you are correct. It’s a $1.6 billion of next-Gen awards since the merger. The OCE platform was launched, the replatforming was done for the CRM product as of the end of last year, I think we had the launch event in December I recall with sales force. And we are in the market now and we mentioned some of this most significant wins with PFI we record that team mostly midsize as you know the large pharma segment essentially is in the long-term contract with the competitor, but we have good hopes of winning back some of those over time. And in the meantime, we are the renew cycle is kind of beginning now 18/19 and we hope to win some of those back. But in the meantime, we are winning every single time that we compete on these type of products in the midsize segment.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then what’s the plan or what needs to happen to turn around the IES business. I mean is it realistic to that or is the goal to get it to may be – flat growth, what’s going to be considered success here and how you’ll get there?
Ari Bousbib: Well look during 2017, we evaluated several strategic options for the business. As you know including the sale process and I have talked very transparently about this. It’s the legacy contract sales organization, which had about somewhere $703 million and $760 million of revenue in 2017 and single-digit EBITDA margins. And after we have gone through the process and so it’s a fairly small industry and it goes in the cycles, we felt that it was not the right time and we decided to integrate this segment at the end of last year with our broader portfolio of offerings. So we are going to continue report it separately, but we are now managing it locally. It’s a very local business and when it was managed as a global entity it probably had too much costs and maybe it was bit far from client. So we are trying to integrate it with our regional and country level sales force and we try to leverage our technology and customer relationships to optimize operations. So hopefully we will report better numbers going forward, but again it’s not a market that has wind in it sales.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tycho Peterson: I want to go back to guidance for a sec just so we’re clear. You are raising by less than a beat here presumably that reflects kind of timing on the pull forward and reimburse expenses for R&D solutions. So maybe two questions there can you just give us the sense of how we should model that reimburse expense component of the next couple quarter and is that solely the reason why you are expecting the sequential decline.
Mike McDonnell: Yes. So Tycho, it’s Mike. On the reimburse expenses you should model that in a manner that’s consistent with what we said last quarter we estimated that the pass-throughs and the aggregate for the entire company would be on the order of $1.6 billion that is for R&D, commercial and IES we still think that’s about the right number. We have said that about $175 million of that $1.6 billion would be non-R&D and so if you take that $1.425 billion and divide by the quarter the pass-through did come in a little heavier in the first quarter at $390 for R&D, but we still think that, that’s due to phasing and we are still sticking with that that same estimate, which we what we baked into our thinking on the guidance.
Ari Bousbib: Yes the 1.6 includes some pass-throughs on the commercial side.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, I said that yes.
Tycho Peterson: And then Ari a question on real world evidence just two parts here, one is the FDA more receptive to kind of incorporating and looking at some of that data. And then on the pharma side are you seeing any evidence of pharma customers looking to use real world evidence to pursue label expansion at this point.
Ari Bousbib: Yes very much so, good questioned a lot of interest in doing single arm studies. I mentioned one again this is where you instead of having a cord of randomized patients that are going to take the drug and go through treatment and that we’re using a placebo for another parallel cord or several ones we don’t do that. We compare to a model and patients taken from out database and the FDA is very willing for label expansions to look to do that. And actually we are midst of a - we just won a very significant study. Obviously the more we do that the more it favors our business because we’ve got the asset here to deploy and so we are very excited about that.
Tycho Peterson: And then one last one, I appreciate the color you guys gave on Next-Gen award. Just curious on fixed price contracts overall where you are in rolling those out and what part of the backlog is fixed price at this point?
Mike McDonnell: Our Next-Gen award is becoming a bigger part of the mix overall it's probably inching towards about 50% of what we are bidding on these days. And a portion of that would be fixed price and we do fixed price and instances where we have good line of sight on recruitment and we feel like we have been comfortably commit to it so it would be a subset of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jack Meehan: So want to focus on the new awards and R&D solutions were up 16%, looked very healthy, but could you talk about the pacing of the RFP flow you seem to start the year and any increased activity or interest around the strategic partnerships?
Ari Bousbib: The RFP flow is as healthy as it has been, actually a very significant number of RFPs coming through. We told you I think already last quarter that Q4 RFP was significantly higher than Q4, 2016. I can tell you the RFP flow Q1 2018 was significantly higher than Q1, 2017, so same trend. And then of course as you know we have a strategy we talked about before called see more, win more, so we’re casting wider net. And again very healthy momentum, our NNB on the old basis are up 15% I don’t know if we mentioned this but even in the quarter bookings are up 17.5% year-over-year and that obviously has far please we believe we are gaining market share and we are gaining a bigger share because of Next-Gen but partly also we see a healthy underlying market here. So the market is not growing at 17.5% but I think we see a healthy pipe here, there is no signs that is abating anyway.
Jack Meehan: Sorry if I missed this earlier, but related to the segment guidance that you provided last quarter, is it safer to say you feel little better about commercial and R&D solutions at this point and maybe a little towards the lower end with IES? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: Yes.
Andrew Markwick: We’re coming up on the hour operator, so I think we probably got time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir.
Ross Muken: So maybe just on the sort of the technology side in the R&D business. I think you called out maybe some interest in the virtual trial side and we've heard a lot more interest in terms of the concept around the side list trial. Maybe give us a feel for one, where that interest is coming from and how to size or think about how that could play into the market. And then secondarily on the patient recruitment side or some of the other tools you’re employing to drive these kind of Next-Gen wins. Do you feel like you're getting the proof points in terms of that the client base market are more broadly because we are hearing at least from customers a lot more favorable sort of feedback or at least awareness relative to some of the ways you can influence start-up times and total cost of trial et cetera?
Ari Bousbib: Ross I'd love to spend a few hours here telling you about the stuff that we’re doing here in Next-Gen we just have a couple of minutes but we got a lot to say here on your question, imposing question because its speaks to the future of the industry. Just to touch on virtual trials again we're not going to totally eliminate the way we do trials today you still require the full understanding of the disease area, the study protocol, the country level regulations, and how to assemble the right process to deliver on a global scale. So you still need all of those things, right, but we have a very strong uptick in sponsor interest in an innovative way of managing the trials, to which the problem here is in classical trials, you have a lot of sites to manage it’s not unusual to have 100s of site in a clinical trial that you’re managing at the same time. And everyone of these sites has investigators and requires a separate start-up and separate system and CRS on this side and patients. So it is as a concept is a difficult machinery to make work at the same time. The virtual trial the idea is to have one site, one virtual site that then deals with all the local labs and deals with the patients at their location. If you think about it today less than 5% of eligible patients actually participate in clinical research, one of the main reasons is that a distance to a site is significant. The average distance that a patient who is enrolled in a trial struggles to a site is 50 miles, 70% of eligible patients live at least two hours away from a physical site and so largely don’t participate in a clinical trial. So the idea here of course is to reduce the cost, reduce the timeline but also make it a lot more efficient by using remote monitoring of patients at their homes. So in terms of how we are working on this obviously because we have a better understanding of where the patients are and with availability of centralized monitoring which as you know we have best-in-class capabilities in, we’re building out a technology platform that is something we call a study hub that facilitates video chats with investigators, telemedicine, eConsent you mentioned the technology acquisitions we did last year on the clinical side with DrugDev that’s part of that strategy scheduling, notification, the ability to send medical records and to answer study to questions like simple questions, how are you feeling today? Did you take your medicine and so on. Plus the relationship with the local labs, so all of these present an extraordinary opportunity. If you ask me what is the pipeline, again it's not - I think the total pipeline we have now we probably - I am going to say $100 million of opportunity in total and this is several small studies again mostly with EBPs with difficult diseases and so on. But I think there is growing interest and we have a lot of conversation. The regulators are very supportive, FDA also in Europe, the EMA very supportive and encouraging us to explore new ways of doing this as long as we maintain patient safety of course and data integrity. And again with the technology that we have we are able to do this. Again the idea is to reduce the patient burden to streamline the start-up because it just the one virtual site. It’s a much shorter, there are patient recruitment facilitated because it’s a expanded patient access, the patient would not normally participate because they are too far from the site would participate. We have a 100% remote monitoring maybe with very limited visits but again considerably reduce the CRA trouble to sites facilitate I think the data integrity would be much higher because it would be all electronic and there will be consistency of process versus inconsistent across sites and a mix of electronic systems depending on the sites et cetera. So there is a lot of interest, I could spend a lot of time on this. As I said there is a just a couple of minutes. So again we are very excited and under the proof points on Next-Gen it’s going to accelerate. The proof points we are able to show now are on a much larger sample. Last time we spoke about this, I guess it was in November Investor Meeting. We only had a very few Next-Gen trials that were starting up, literally a handful that we could speak about. Today, we already have several dozens that are full speed ahead and that for example, we have 70 trials at the moment where we already in the patients enrollment stage. And this 70 trials include over 1800 sites. So the data that we can use to prove the effectiveness of Next-Gen over traditional approach is much broader and it’s a broader scale and the more time goes by, you will see Next-Gen award that we won are on start-up mode and we will be able to have a broader base for our proof points. With that, thank you very much for the question and for the call. Andrew?
Andrew Markwick: Yes, thanks very much everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to talking with you on our second quarter 2018 earnings call. I will be available for the rest of the day to take up any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-14 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Markwick - VP of IR Ari Bousbib - Chairman and CEO Mike McDonnell - EVP and CFO
Analysts: Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Tejas Savant - JP Morgan Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Eric Coldwell - Baird George Hill - RBC
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 14, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards which is discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss accounting standard ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Preliminary 2017 financials have been provided inclusive of the adoption of ASC 606. The recast of these financials will be finalized during the first quarter of 2018 and is therefore subject to change. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call where we will close out 2017 and provide guidance for 2018. I'm pleased to report that we finished 2017 with strong financial results. For this final quarter, we delivered revenue and profit numbers at the higher end or above our guidance range. The IQVIA team delivered solid operational performance and executed well on integration plans during our first full-year, as a merged company. Let's review the quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.161 billion grew 10.7% and when adjusting for merger related deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of '16 revenue grew 7.7%. Fourth quarter commercial services revenue growth was 10.6%, R&D Solutions 6.6% and Integrated Engagement Services revenue was down about 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $582 million. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on our financial commitments during our first full-year as a merged company. We were able to achieve this even as we began in a complex integration process and invested heavily in the business for future growth. Our integration teams have made great progress. We would reorganize the business during 2017. We leveraged the legacy IMS operating infrastructure, implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level and regional level, and we unified our go-to-market approach across the R&D and commercial businesses. We invested in new resources, ramping our next-generation of clinical development headcount during the year. We now have approximately 200 professionals performing these activities who were not here a year ago, and we should be at 250 soon. The R&D business closed the year with another solid quarter of new bookings. The R&D business posted LTM net new business of $4.5 billion. We're very pleased with the bookings traction we gained post-merger. To put this in context and looking at bookings under the old as award approach, we actually had over $5 billion of gross awards in 2017. I believe it is a record number for our R&D business ever. This uptick in new business performance is driven as you know by two main factors. The first one, we implemented a strategy called, See More We More, where we aim to capture more of the available opportunities in a given quarter. In fact, I think the number of RFPs that came in during the fourth quarter was significantly higher compared to last year. The second reason the innovation that we have been discussing all along. Our next-generation capabilities represented about 20% of the $5 billion gross awards in '17, and if I could finish 17 with over $1.2 billion of post-merger awards with these capabilities. We saw an uptick in the emerging biopharma space during the quarter with over 70% of Q4 next-generation awards coming from these customer segments. I want to give you some color and give and give a couple of examples. We had a win of three schizophrenia studies with a U.S. based biopharma focused on central nervous system disorders. Our differentiated approach to analytics driven site ID and our ability to drive patient referral was key to this win. A biopharma company based in Asia awarded us a lung cancer trial. Again this was driven by our differentiated approach to site ID. Another biopharma company also focused on oncology awarded our team a breast cancer study. The client had no more work with us in the past, but the insights we provided on patient populations across North America, Europe and Asia demonstrated true differentiation and secured the win. Switching to our commercial segment, I want to highlight our tech business which had another solid year. As you know, technology has always been an investment focus for us and so it was in '17. In addition to replatforming our commercial applications onto sales forces, marketing cloud and force.com, we also began to build a suite of clinical technology offerings. Leveraging a strategy from the IMS commercial tech playbook, we completed a number of small tuck-in deals throughout '17. We now are working hard to integrate these assets, as we create a single platform of clinical and commercial technology. We launched our new orchestrated customer engagement offering or OCE, a successor to the CRM platforms in December. Over 100 clients joined the event in Philadelphia and as you know till then we won significant OCE deal with Pierre Fabre, which we recently announced. I am also pleased to report during Q4, we had a number of multiyear OCE wins with clients in U.S. and Canada. The other bright spot in our commercial business is our real work insight business which posted another strong year, growing in fact high teens in the fourth quarter and solid double digits for the year. During Q4, we signed multiple deals with the top five pharma clients with benefit from our analytical and technology driven approach to Phase IV research. We also signed a deal with the top U.S. pharma company to run and enrich study for osteoporotic fractures in six countries. This study will combine retrospective database analytics with prospective data collection, which I remind you combined the capabilities of both real-world legacy teams. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer to take you through the financials in more detail.
Mike McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning to everyone. As Ari mentioned, we're pleased with our strong finish to the year and now let's review the details. Fourth quarter revenue of 2.161 billion grew 10.7% reported and 8.4% at constant currency. You'll recall the $55 million deferred revenue adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was a non-cash adjustment and was the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger required the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue which would have otherwise converted to revenue. Adjusting for this 55 million of deferred revenue, fourth quarter revenue grew 7.7% reported and 5.5% at constant currency. Commercial Solutions revenue of 1.027 billion grew 10.6% reported and 7.8% at constant currency. R&D Solutions service revenue of 947 million grew 6.6% at actual FX rates and 5% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of 187 million declined 3.3% at actual FX rates and 4.7% at constant currency. And now turning to profit, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was 582 million. GAAP net income was 1.076 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.02. GAAP net income and GAAP diluted earnings per share benefited from a 977 million provisional one-time reduction of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. This reduction which is related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 resulted in the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the lower U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% and the reversal of our deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings net of the newly enacted transition tax. Importantly, approximately 400 million of this adjustment is equal to a permanent tax liability reduction, and this will be realized as cash tax savings that we will see overtime as we will now repatriate overseas cash without additional U.S. tax expense. Adjusted net income was 300 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a $1.40 in the fourth quarter. Now, let's take a look at the full-year results. I'd like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Full-year revenue was 8.060 billion and grew 4.3% reported and 4.2% at constant currency. In addition to the $55 million deferred revenue adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016, you will recall the deferred revenue negatively impacted the first and second quarters of 2017 by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, full-year revenue grew 3.7% at actual FX rates and 3.5% at constant currency. Commercial Solutions revenue of $3.638 billion grew 4.4% at actual FX rates and 4% at constant currency. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles' Encore business as well as headwinds in the legacy Quintiles' advisory consulting business. The sale of the Encore business resulted in a drag of about 1.5% to full-year Commercial Solutions growth. On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions service revenue of $3.647 billion grew 4.3% reported and 4.4% at constant currency. Growth in the segment was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations during the third quarter of 2016. Facility closure resulted in a drag of about 1% the full-year R&D Solutions growth. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $783 million declined 2.6% reported and 2% at constant FX. Full-year revenue growth in the IES business was impacted by one-time $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. Now turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog, closing backlog at December 31, 2017 was $10.54 billion as compared to $9.5 billion at the end of 2016. We’re very pleased with our new business performance in 2017. Now as Ari mentioned, our gross new business awards were over $5 billion for the year. Contracted net new business was $4.54 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. Both LTM net new business and LTM book-to-bill metric improved significantly during the year as our next-generation capabilities and new go-to-market model are resonating very well with clients. I do want to remind you that this is a long cycle business and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow that we still encourage you to book on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. You should also focus on the absolute dollar values. And now turning to profit for the full-year, full-year adjusted EBITDA was $2.047 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.4% expanded 30 basis points. GAAP net income was $1.309 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.88 for the full-year of 2017. Both GAAP net income and GAAP diluted earnings per share benefited from the 977 million one-time provisional reduction of net deferred tax liabilities that I mentioned previously. Adjusted net income was $1.039 billion, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.67 for the full-year 2017. And now let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled 959 million and debt was 10.2 billion, resulting in net debt of about $9.3 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was five times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA and net of cash our leverage ratio was 4.5 times. Now as we told you at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November, we will target net leverage over the medium term of 4 times to 4.5 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. We feel very comfortable at this level given our high rate of cash conversion and revenue visibility. Cash flow from operating activities was 233 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were 102 million and free cash flow was 131 million. During the month of November, we repurchased 255 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors; and toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional 114 million worth of our shares in the open market for total share repurchases of 369 million during the fourth quarter. Our board today also authorized an increase in our post-merger share repurchase program from 3.5 billion to 5 billion leaving us with the remaining authorization of approximately $1.7 billion. And now before we turn to guidance, let's discuss the change in revenue standard ASC 606 which is effective January 1, 2018. Today, we have recognized revenue in the R&D Solutions segment on a milestone basis. As of January 1, 2018, we required to adopt ASC 606 which requires percentage of completion revenue recognition. This means that for every project we are required to calculate total cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs and recognize revenue on the basis of that calculation. These percentages of completion calculators are required to be updated on a regular basis and changes in estimates will cause fluctuations in our revenue recognition. Given that our business is a long cycle business and projects run over several years, these changes can have a significant impact on the period in which revenue was recognized. In addition to the change from the milestone basis for the percentage of completion basis, ASC 606 requires the service revenue and reimbursed expense revenue which included items such as investigator payments with revenue and cost in equal amounts to be treated consistently. This means that reimbursed expense revenue will be included in the percentage of completion calculation and will be presented with service revenue as one line on the income statement going forward. Please note that there is pass-through revenue not just in our R&D business but also in Commercial Solutions and Integrated Engagement Services segment primarily in Integrated Engagement Services. Due to these changes, we have provided a preliminary recast of 2017 financials on the new basis. Revenue recast under the new standard now includes pass-through revenue and due to the nature of pass-throughs, this results in adjusted EBITDA margin compression of approximately 5 percentage points. This margin compression is optics only the economics of the business are unchanged. In addition when 2017 financials are recast under ASC 606, it results in a negative adjustment of $37 million to both revenue and profit, as the revenue adjustment resulting from the new approach is allocated to prior and future periods. This negative adjustment is due to the fact that we happened to have a higher proportion of our projects in earlier phases where pass-throughs are incurred at a slower pace. It could have been a positive adjustment of our overall mix without the latter stages of product lifecycle. And as a result, we currently expect pass-throughs to be a drag on revenue growth. Therefore when recasting 2017, our full-year results would have been as follows. Revenue of 9.702 billion, adjusted EBITDA of 2.01 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.55. Before we look at 2018 guidance on a new basis to help with comparability, let's look at guidance on the old basis. Absent the implementation of ASC 606 full-year 2018 revenue 8.45 billion to 8.65 billion, adjusted EBITDA 2.19 billion to 2.26 billion and adjusted diluted EPS $5.35 to $5.60, which is year-over-year growth of 14% to 20%. Let's turn to 2018 guidance inclusive of the adoption of ASC 606. Our full-year 2018 revenue guidance is 10 billion to 10.2 billion. This guidance assumes a negative adjustment to both revenue and profit resulting from the new revenue standard, which in 2018 is expected to be in the same range as 2017. It also includes pass-through revenue which is expected to be approximately 1.6 billion in 2018. Of this amount our IES and commercial segments have pass-throughs of approximately 175 million with the remainder being an R&D Solutions. You should note that pass-through revenue can vary depending on the mix of clinical trials. As a result of the significant new business that we generated in 2017, more of our trials are in our early phases and pass-through revenue is not normally generated until later in the trial. Due to this higher mix of trials in the startup phase, pass-through revenue is expected to dampen 2018 R&D Solutions revenue growth by about 3.5% to 4% and total company revenue growth by about 2%. Again, this is just optics. The economics of the business are unchanged which you will see when you look at the limited impact of these headwinds have on our 2018 guidance are both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. This revenue guidance also assumes currency rates remained at current levels for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we have a high level of visibility into our full-year revenue. Under the new revenue standard, we have line of sight into approximately $4.5 billion of 2018 R&D Solutions revenue and the Commercial Solutions business has historically been about 70% recurring. For the full-year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.15 billion and $2.22 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.20 and $5.45 which represents year-over-year growth of 14% to 20% or the exact same growth rates as the old accounting basis. Both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the adjustment resulting from the new revenue standard that was discussed earlier. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $390 million, operational depreciation and amortization of approximately $275 million, other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $35 million and a continuation of our share repurchase activity. Tax rates are now expected to be approximately 24% for the adjusted book tax rate and approximately 17% for the adjusted cash tax rate. You will note that the adjusted book tax rate is about 4 percentage points lower than it was last year and this is partially the result of tax reform in the U.S. For the first quarter of 2018 assuming current FX rate remained constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $520 million and $540 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.23 and $1.30. And so to summarize, we have a solid performance in 2017. We closed the year with a stronger financial performance. Our integration teams drove solid execution of their plans. We reorganized the business during 2017 to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure, implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level and unified our go-to-market approach across R&D and Commercial. R&D Solutions gross new business awards totaled more than 5 billion for 2017. Our R&D business enhanced by next-generation capabilities saw success in the market with over $1.2 billion of post-merger awards. Our commercial team launched our new OCE SaaS based offering which is gaining traction in the market. Real-world insights grew solid double digits. We invested heavily in the business for future growth. We have repurchased 3.6 billion of our shares at an average price of $82.76 since the merger. We successfully merged two large organizations, repositioned the Company in the market and rebranded the Company as IQVIA, and of course, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500. We look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2018. And with that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: [Operation Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Erin Wright: The next-gen offering I guess continues to gain traction here which now associated with business win to 1.2 billion. Are you addressing more of the incoming RFP flow with the next-gen offering? I guess where does that percentage stand at this point?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, thank you Erin. We are in this seeing a lot of interest and our traction in the market -- we originally thought that we would be able to target up to 20% of the pipeline with our next-gen capabilities. But as we progressed and taking this to market now it's becoming operational, we see that it can be applied to a much bigger proportion of the trials and substantially 50% or 60%. So we are excited, we are totally are ahead of our original plans in terms of next-generation capabilities based awards. I think now our premerger or the time of the merger, we were hoping to have books by now about $300 million of next-gen base capabilities wins, but in fact we have 1.2 billion. So, we are very pleased with the traction we're getting so far. We also find that in the biotech area and that was particularly true with the fourth quarter, it is very applicable and very compelling. It's probably also easier generally because the decision making process is simpler in the EBP segment, and you generally have very senior leaders and sponsors that are exposed to our demos directly and can make a decision. So, in fact 70% of the next-generation awards during Q4 were with emerging biotech. And of course as we noted previously, we are very pleased that many large pharma companies that had previously done zero business with Quintiles Legacy CRO business have awarded us significant trials on the back of those capabilities since the merger.
Erin Wright: Right, that's very helpful, I guess quick follow-up to that. Where are you leveraging the fixed price model as well? And I am curious, if you're seeing any sort of competitive response to that in the market?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, again, we have to be obviously -- this is new, we are very careful about this. We don’t disclose really how much of our new business is fixed price. These are, obviously, commercial elements to the strategy. We said previously that about maybe up to a quarter of the next-gen capabilities awards have idle in totality a fixed price in contractual arrangement or a hybrid fixed price in contractual arrangement. There are aspects of the project that lend themselves more to fixed price. We hope overtime that this will apply to more of the pipe and again we will be monitoring this carefully. We always have -- always say, we mind the business of growing our market share and our revenues. We’re also in the business of growing our margins.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tejas Savant: This is Tejas on for Tycho. Mike just one quick question here on the guidance. Can you just quantify the impact of FX and acquisitions along with the embedded headwinds from the Encore divestiture and the closure of the early development facility and R&D Solutions? Obviously, the latter two are presumably a headwind to your guidance, but the prior two hopefully are tailwinds. So just would help to get some color on that.
Ari Bousbib: You want to answer Mike or Andrew.
Mike McDonnell: So, I think in terms of acquisition contribution if you look at the full-year '17, and I think our growth was little under 4%, and obviously we've had headwinds as we said we had from Encore and ECD. Mike called out the drags for the full-year by segment, I think if you take it up to the total company level, you got about a 100 basis points of drag there. And then IES has also been a little bit of a drag of 120 basis points or so. So your growth really excluding those drags closer to 5%. Now, as we said a year ago, we've been aggressively kind of trying to build up in the clinical tech space and so we’ve done a number of acquisitions things like DrugDev, Wingspan, HighPoint also. So we've done more than we usually would do. So we're at the higher end of our usual range, which is usually kind of 1 to 2 point. So, we're kind at the couple of points or so organic, inorganic contribution in the fourth quarter for the full-year that is rather -- sorry not fourth quarter.
Tejas Savant: Got it. And you're expecting a similar run rate in terms of your 2018 outlook as well.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, I think I mean over the medium term we’ve always said it’s kind of one to two points of contribution from acquisition. I think again it’s probably it’s probably going to be highest to the higher end given the amount of clinical tech stuff we did during 2017, so probably at the higher end of that 2.1.
Ari Bousbib: Right and that's because those acquisitions were down through the year. So roughly about half of the revenue that they would have contributed came in 2017, and so the other half, we have the full-year, will come in '18. So that’s what we see in the numbers.
Tejas Savant: Got it. And one quick follow--up for you, Ari, just in terms of the IES decline in 2018 looks like you’re calling for about 7.5% to 13% down year-over-year. Can you just talk to us a little bit about what specific measures you are putting in place to perhaps help stabilize that business?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, so as you know, I don’t think it was a secret. We spent -- we have a lot to do in other parts of the business and we spent considerable amount of time working on the R&D and the commercial integration. We decided to explore strategic alternatives for the business and we went through that process, and as a result kind of let the segment very much long during the year. We had a few reviews but we carved out the financials. We stood it up as a separate business entity. Even though again, this business is a very local business, probably the single most local business is all of the businesses in our portfolio. The decisions are very much contrary level very local, but we left it operating as a global segment. We continue to report other segments for now though we made the decision to integrate it more with our regional go-to-market business model and to have our commercial leaders take ownership for it at the regional level. So that’s the first big change that we have that is we are going to take it to market along side, the rest of our commercial products and services suite. Separately from the product side, obviously we have a lot of capabilities whether its information assets or technology applications. We talked about OCE that we are going to a factor into the equation when we go to market. Again, to the degree we can equip our sales reps with more capabilities, data and tech, we believe they can be more effective in the marketplace, and we believe we can at least partially price that with customers than -- we probably have -- potentially have a winner in terms of beginning to turnaround that business. So, that, these are the two main things. Reorganization of the go-to-market, re-localize the business and to bring more capabilities to the floor. And we want to be realistic and conservative in terms of what we expect given the market dynamics of an overall relatively stable to declining sales reps headcount globally and pockets of the markets were that is declining. Bear in mind also, we don’t have that business in many regions, many regions of the world like, I think the entire Asia Pacific region doesn’t have -- we don’t have any presence whatsoever in this business. And that is the region where actually there are market opportunities, market growth opportunities. With the exception of Japan, we have no presence in those markets. So again, by integrating the business more regionally, we potentially have an opportunity to address segments that we were not previously addressing when the business was a more standalone.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Jones: Just looking at the R&D solutions backlog conversion, fell a little bit sequentially. I know there is a lot of moving parts in quarter-to-quarter conversion. But anything worth calling out that might have weighted on the conversion? And then, Ari, with the traction you are seeing in next-gen as that constitutes more and more of the bookings each quarter. How should we think about the conversion rate picking up as we trend through 2018?
Ari Bousbib: Look, it's hard to focus on a quarterly burn rate metric. Burn rate kind of fluctuate for a number of reasons. If you win a large multiyear study and we didn't win quite a few, the burn rate will go down. If you win more SST work, the burn rate may go down depending on the length of the contract. A very strong bookings quarter may cause the next quarters' burn rate to go down. So also our burn rate tends to fluctuate with season trend as well. So it's hard to draw conclusions from one quarter. So in theory, you should see for the industry as a whole. For the industry as a whole, we should see burn rates to reduce as a trend, simply because patients are becoming harder to find and trials are becoming more complex. So product gets stuck into backlog and patient recruitment kind of slows. So, this is why a blind next-generation capabilities and using our analytics and technology and so on, we're having success rescuing these studies and overtime you are correct those should help us do better than overall industry.
Robert Jones: And then, Mike, if I could just sneak one in on guidance. Anything there contemplated around share repurchases? How would you expect for us to trend out or model out the 1.7 billion authorization over the course of the year?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, so Bob, we do have a new authorization and certainly we continue to see our stock as a very attractive investment and we will continue to be a buyer. You shouldn’t expect the pace that you saw perhaps that we did in 2017, but certainly we are going to continue to be a buyer of our shares and we factored at least some of that into our thinking for the 2018 guidance. And I think that the authorization that we announced today also sets up very nicely through repurchasing stock, not only in 2018 but beyond that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Muken: On the tech solution side, it seems like you are getting pretty good momentum with the OCE products. In general, it also seems like you've added a couple of pretty interesting new capabilities via acquisition over the last quarter. So could you just give us a little bit more color about the breadth of demand on some parts of tech solutions and then maybe just a little bit about sort of the cadence of how some these new pieces will kind of supplement the overall growth rate?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, Ross, thank you for the question and by the way welcome back. We as you know have had the tradition at IMS historically to develop technology capabilities. We did this partially in-house and partially through acquisition of capabilities and typically we buy a small company that has one or two applications and then we take them to a different level by integrating them into the rest of the applications, number one. And number two, by allowing our sales force to take you to market to clients who would not have otherwise considered buying from a small outfit. That has been our strategy. And early on post-merger, we identified a great opportunity on the clinical technology side. That is redoing the same thing that we've done with commercial side, which culminated as you mentioned with this OCE offering, which is sale force platform based. Do the same thing on the clinical technology, and by the way, we're working also hand in hand with sales force and other partners on the clinical side. The reason why we feel this is different and unique, this is not new many people have identified this issue. Processes are very, very manual in life sciences, a lot of paper. Great opportunity for automation of what's really our standard processes. The processes are already standardized because they're highly regulated in many instances. And the history and the tradition have been as these were largely paper based and manual. So when you look at it in a wholesome fashion, really from the clinical side to the commercialization side, you see that they all leverage the same data inputs and really could be handled on a seamless technology platform. And that is where we want to play. There are in the market many technology applications some of them very successful whether it’s a math data management application or a CRM application, but they are very siloed. Our strategy is to build a technology platform across the board. That doesn't mean that you have to buy the entire platform, the entire suite, you can buy a module and it’s a plug and play, but you get material benefits both in terms of deployment of the platform and implementation. You noted maybe that we bought a company in the fourth quarter called HighPoint. That's a technology implementation services company. And the reason we did this is because we want to continue develop this idea that we can help our clients do better, be more efficient and deploy state-of-the-art capability and we want to provide the implementation. Many times when we go-to-market, clients starts well this is great, but how do I make it work, right. I mean this is -- it looks good but I just don't have the capabilities in-house. And today when they buy one application from a technology vendor, they've got to go out and ask people like Accenture or IBM or what have you, to come in as a third-party implementation vendor. And while we do work with those as well, the reality is, it is a lot better and most seamless experience for the customer win. We think ownership responsibility for the delivery of the technology and the operationalization of the technology with the clients' personnel directly without another implementation partner in the middle. So that’s our strategy and we think it’s a little different than others, and we are very excited by the prospects also on the clinical side.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Coldwell: I have got a few questions, if you'll bear with me. First off I know you've said current rates in the revenue guidance. I’m curious if you can give us more specificity on what you think the current rates contribute to revenue growth in 2018?
Mike McDonnell: Yes, I would say this, Eric. We think it’s the best way to guide I think that we put the guidance based on current rates and where they sit today and gave you the growth indications by segment. Obviously, our guidance assumes that those rates are going to stay consistent throughout the rest of the year, which we think is the most appropriate way to guide. And that’s just kind of how we calculate and how we do it, and hopefully that’s the way it's done that makes the most sense.
Eric Coldwell: Yes, it does. I’m thinking about maybe in FX revenue tailwind that maybe 2% to 2.5%, right now. Is that a fair approach?
Mike McDonnell: Yes, the most disappoint point.
Eric Coldwell: And most disappoint now?
Mike McDonnell: Yes.
Eric Coldwell: Okay. Good.
Mike McDonnell: You mean when comparing actual rates across '17 versus the rates that which we’re planning for '18, which is actually the end of year rates of '17 that’s what you mean, right?
Eric Coldwell: Just the average year-over-year contribution as the year progressed.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, right. So it’s about reform. I understand your question is about.
Eric Coldwell: The commercial segment, more important question here, the commercial segment had a really strong fourth quarter. I know there were some seasonal items and some timing items and I think that point through the call today maybe address this in generally, but I’m hoping for a lot more detail on this north of $50 million revenue bid in the fourth quarter compared to street models. What is reason everybody else get wrong here in terms of that fourth quarter trend? And then the guidance for commercial also seems to be particularly good for 2018. I’m curious if perhaps some of this heightened M&A pace is helping that segment, if I don’t know if you reclassify anything into that segment from other segments. But anymore detail on the strength in commercial growth will be very helpful?
Ari Bousbib: No, okay, fine. So I am going to take that and ask you guys to chime in. The -- well, it's a good observation. First of all, the fourth quarter hockey stick has always been the true on the commercial side. I’m speaking now about the legacy IMS piece of the commercial side, which is the bulk of the business. So, we always had fourth quarter. What -- the reason this happens frankly Eric is that our client have budgets is that they planned on and they tend to be prudent earlier in the year and then with summer is kind of dull drawn so the third quarter typically is low. And then the fourth quarter, people kind of get busy again and set up the year. So, they set up their data needs. So they approach this there. They finalize their technology plans and so there is a lot of last quarter activity going into November December on the commercial side that has always be the case. If we go back to IMS historical numbers, you see fourth quarter always very strong. Second driver particularly this year is the real world business which we -- was I'd say the largest part of the legacy Quintiles business that we inherited from the merger and that came into new commercial segment wasn’t doing that great, earlier in the year or other time of the merger. And a considerable amount of work was put into reorganizing this business and integrating it. And it's a little bit of a shorter cycle and it also has long cycle, this is little bit of a shorter cycle business. And we were able to see early on great results from that and we saw in the fourth quarter in the beginning of the turnaround on the Quintiles real-world legacy business, the real world late Phase, which integrated -- we have always said that was a -- I recall I'll remind you this was the original area of collaboration Quintiles decided to the merger was on the real world style. And so, we kind of had a hedge stock if you will and the fourth quarter was particularly strong there and also is responsible for some of that perhaps higher uptick in the fourth quarter on the commercial side. Anything else guys you wanted to suggest on the commercial side.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, the Encore thing that was kind of big drag. On the commercial side, this Encore stuff really was 150 basis points of drag for the year. So when you add that back it's kind of a gets you to about six point of growth for '17 approximately and that’s kind of what we have been generating here in year out in the legacy IMS business. We have some more drag here because we move the clinical tech the CTOs business to clinical, but let's say six point of which as we said this acquisition there is always going to be acquisitions one to two point. So it's very consistent with our history once we clear up the drag from Encore.
Eric Coldwell: The last couple of quarters you helped us out and I know I'm going to be in trouble for asking as you hate the quarterly backlog and bookings questions. But I'm old school, so I have to do it. FX Mike, I don’t know how much FX contributed or took away, but I would assume a little contribution to that book-to-bill? And was there any M&A affiliated addition to the bookings or the backlog this quarter?
Ari Bousbib: The book, I mean, I want to be very clear, Mike. And we wanted to be clear we showed you book-to-bill ratios exclude FX, okay. If you add FX, the book-to-bill ratio is north of 1:3. That’s not -- we took out FX. When we shown you those book-to-bill metrics, we want to show you what is the underlying growth of the business. If you want to look at, you want us to look at honestly what actually is the revenue built into the booked backlog for the future and look at it as actual effects, it's going to be higher than that. And the backlog reported at $10.5 billion -- $10.4 billion, that's at the yearend close backlog and maybe there is what you want to say how much of that in FX.
Mike McDonnell: Yes, maybe like 100 million.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, $100 million maybe of that is really coming from it.
Mike McDonnell: The 1.24 LTM to make it very clear, we pull FX out of that to make it more apples-to-apples.
Andrew Markwick: You want to have one more question.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, I think I am coming up on the hour, but I think we probably got time to squeeze in one more question.
Operator: Certainly, our last question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
George Hill: Hey good morning guys and I appreciate you squeezing me in. I'll keep this simple because Eric kind of stole my question on the commercial business. I guess maybe Mike or Ari, can you talk about, you talked about file complexities, how should we think about how the timeline is changing from bookings to trial starts? And I guess do you feel like next-gen is helping you get to trial, get the trials up and running sooner? and I'm kind of trying to tie this all into the new accounting standard kind of like, and I guess how should we, just how should we be thinking about as a modeling lag from book as we did the bookings to backlog to revenue like, what is the lag looking like now and how are you guys thinking of the opportunities.?
Ari Bousbib: Yes, it's hard to model overall because we have so many projects going on, some of them are next-gen, some of them are not some of them are FX piece. It’s a different life across the overall book of business. I can tell you is that for the projects and soon we're going to have well over a 100 trials that are actually active based on next-gen capabilities. And we’re looking forward to reporting those metrics for larger base. If you remember at the November conference, Cindy Verst, who runs now that platform for us, reported some metrics in terms of acceleration of the timelines between booking and site start up and those look quite significant. Now, we did point out at the time that is all a very small sample of -- this was a small sample of trials so we don’t want to say that that improvement is going to be true across the board. We don't feel confident enough to say that it’s going to be as high as it was. But I mean we can certainly go back and look at the numbers and it was quite significant improvements on the timelines. Now as we do more and more next-gen base trials, you will see that we will report and we'll tell you how many results there was. But just to give you a second refresh the numbers that Cindy showed, these were really early proof points. Now, we don't think it’s enough to make it a model, but the benchmark from booking to site selection is typically 80 to 100 days. And with next-gen we're able to do it in less than 30 days. So you see a dramatic improvement to site selection. The timeline to site startup is usually between 60 and 300 days thereabouts with the early next-gen results we were between 15 and 240 days. And then the time to patient enrollment then we have a metric there, which measured the speed at which patients are enrolled. So the benchmark we using is 0.29 patients per site per month that’s kind of the baseline metric that we have over a large, large number of products over the long period of time. With next-gen early proof points, we are enrolling 0.46 patients per site per month. So a dramatic improvement from 0.29 to 0.46, again I don’t want to say this is what we are targeting, this is what we are going to be promising in a model, but these are the numbers from the early next-gen based trial as of last November when we reported this. We now have a lot more trials that I am going to get start. I mean we continue to update these figures and feel -- we feel comfortable. Once you have a couple of hundreds trials that are running, we feel we are in good shape. We can say, look, we can get to site identification 75 days faster to site start up 90 days faster and how the first patient enrolled 20 days faster. This makes a dramatic difference. So again, I’m trying to give you as much granularity as I can, but we will continue to update. And again in follow-up calls with the team, we can provide more color as required. I want to -- I think that we're well past the times. Thank you very much.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you everyone. Sorry, we couldn't take all the questions. We look forward to follow up calls.
Ari Bousbib: Yes, we'll be available for the rest of the day to take follow ups. And we look forward to speaking to everyone on our Q1 2018 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the conference for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Quintiles IMS Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 26, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick: Thank you, Isaac. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our Quintiles IMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution the listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2017 and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for the Quintiles IMS team. Results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated. As most of you previously noted, our plan for the year had a steeper ramp and was more backend loaded, because the quarter was stronger than we had anticipated, will have a smoother glide path to our full year targets. Let's review the call, consistent with the last three quarters we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Third quarter revenue was $2.019 million, and it grew 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5 points to revenue growth. R&D Solutions' growth was 7.3%. R&D Solutions' revenue was again negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been nearly 8%. Commercial solutions grew 4%. Growth in commercial solutions was negatively impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, the commercial business would have grown 5.5%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue was slightly down versus the prior year. Combined company adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. We had a number of key wins in the quarter. Let me provide some examples. First, in our technology solutions business, you will recall that we have been accelerating investments in re-platforming our global CRM and MCM capabilities. We told you we are aiming to release our new orchestrated customer engagements or OCE SaaS offering towards the end of the year. This is still on track, and in fact, during the third quarter we had our first OCE win, a seven-year deal with a leading European pharma client to deploy OCE in over 30 countries. As a reminder, OCE is revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. This is not just the CRM tool. We've built a collaborative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our client's commercial operations. It is highly differentiated to the current point solutions that exist in the market. Next, in our real-world insights business, where our team won a multi-million-dollar deal for a first of a kind study with a leading U.S. biotech. Our differentiated approach will utilize secondary data and advanced analytics to gain regulatory approval for label extension. This analytics-enabled approach leverages our E360 tech platform. It will position our clients' product for a new indication at a much faster pace. By the way, this is a trend that we expect to accelerate, there is regulatory actions, such as the 21st Century Cures Act will only increase demand for real-world insights. Finally, in R&D business, we are encouraged by another solid quarter of contracted bookings. In fact, third quarter net new business growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Of course, as you will recall, Q3 2016 was the last standalone quarter for legacy Quintiles before the merger and bookings you will recall for that quarter were pretty abysmal. The results of which is the revenue headwind we are now facing in R&D solutions which you have all noted. However, the strong performance in the four quarters since then has resulted in an uptick of our LTM book-to-bill ratio, which was 1.22 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Next-Gen is a big part of this. It continues to gain traction in the market. We now have approximately $900 million of post-merger Next-Gen awards. Importantly, we are winning R&D business with clients we have done little or no work within the past. Examples of these accounts that we unlocked this quarter due to Next-Gen include: a top 10 global pharma who we have done virtually no full service clinical work with in almost a decade, we won three trials with them during the quarter, two of which were in oncology; a top 20 global pharma, who predominantly in-sources all of their R&D work. They chose Next-Gen due to our compelling value proposition and differentiated capabilities. This is in the area of NASH, a terrible disease that causes liver inflammation and cirrhosis. A top biopharma, who has done nothing with us in the core clinical space for the last 12 years, selected Quintiles IMS for their neurology trial. Our Next-Gen offering was so compelling, we were able to displace the incumbent CRO for the study, and client also picked us to be a preferred provider. Now, as I mentioned last quarter, the traction we see the market space for our Next-Gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in Next-Gen operationalization and resourcing plans. This, of course, creates short-term headwinds for our margins. But as you can see in our numbers, we were able to more than overcome this with our cost savings and productivity initiatives. Before I turning to over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that we are holding our Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City on November 8. We're looking forward to this event. We plan to utilize this occasion to show deeper dives in our three main businesses, with case studies and tech demos. We'll also have an opportunity to get appointed with a broader cross-section of our leadership team. With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail.
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's review the quarter. As in previous quarters, I'd like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Combined company third quarter revenue was $2.019 billion, which was at the high-end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Third quarter revenue grew 4.8% reported and 4.3% at constant currency. R&D Solutions' service revenue of $938 million, grew 7.3% at actual FX rates and 6.9% at constant currency. Growth was again impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth was 7.8%. Commercial Solutions revenue of $887 million, grew 4% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, the Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles' Encore business. Adjusting for Encore growth in Commercial Solutions was 5.6%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $194 million, declined 2.3% at actual FX rates and 1.1% at constant currency. Turning now to profits, third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $512 million, GAAP net income was $84 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Adjusted net income was $260 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19 in the third quarter. Now let's take a look at year-to-date results. Again, I'd like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Year-to-date revenue was $5.899 billion, you'll recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. For the first nine months of 2017, it negatively impacted revenue by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis year-to-date revenue grew 2.9% at constant currency and 2.3% reported. On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions' service revenue of $2.7 billion, grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3.6% at actual FX rates. Again, growth was impacted by a decline in the early clinical development business. Commercial Solutions revenue of $2.611 billion, grew 2.5% at constant currency and 2.1% reported. Year-to-date Commercial Solutions growth was also impacted by the sale of Encore. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $596 million, declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Year-to-date revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by one-time $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. Turning to R&D Solutions' net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, R&D Solutions' as-contracted bookings were $4.37 billion. We had a solid performance in the quarter. Our contracted backlog was $10.32 billion at the end of Q3 and we expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. We've had good backlog progression over the last four quarters. Let's take a quick look. As you know, we already have a largest backlog in the industry. As a reminder, when the merger closed last year, we reviewed our backlog policy and decided to implement a more conservative approach. We now require a written, binding commitment or signed contract to record new business in our backlog. We are happy to be back about $10 billion, once again now using our more conservative approach to bookings. Turning now to profit for the first nine months of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2017 was $1.465 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8%, expanded 30 basis points. GAAP net income was $233 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04 for the first nine months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $739 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.28 in the first nine months of 2017. Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, and our debt was $9.8 billion resulting in net debt of about $8.7 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.3 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $436 million in the third quarter, capital expenditures were $89 million, and free cash flow was $347 million. You saw that during the quarter, we issued $500 million worth of senior euro notes due 2025 at a rate of 2 7/8%. We used the proceeds mostly to retire existing 4 1/8% euro notes that were due 2023. We also refinanced our Term Loan B debt raising an incremental $750 million, which was primarily used to pay down the revolver. We repurchased $380 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors during September, and toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $177 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $557 million of repurchases during Q3. Let's now turn to guidance. As you know, we were always expecting a strong fourth quarter. The over performance in Q3 allows a smother trajectory for the fourth quarter and better visibility to the full-year numbers. For the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. We expect revenue to be between $2.12 billion and $2.16 billion. Adjusted EBITDA to be between $560 million and $585 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.28 and $1.37. We are updating our full-year adjusted book tax rate guidance, which is now expected to be approximately 28%, our previous guidance was approximately 29%. So in summary, we delivered a strong quarter, driven by solid operational execution. Next-Gen continues to gain traction and we had nice wins with previously locked-out accounts. Our technology solutions business, secured their first global multi-year OCE deal. We have repurchased $3.3 billion of our shares at an average price of $81 since the merger and of course as a nice capstone to our first year as a merged company, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500. I look forward to seeing many of you at our November 8 Analyst and Investor conference. And with that, I would now like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan: Hi, thanks, good morning. Ari, I just want to start, great momentum with Next-Gen, could you weigh in on just the general health of R&D funding? And then, how do you think about the R&D Solutions' revenues potentially accelerating in 2018, given the win?
Ari Bousbib: Thanks for the question, Jack. Yeah. Look, it's a mixed bag in terms of R&D funding. As always, there are studies that are being pulled based on developments in the market, pricing and otherwise and competing trials. But as in really for the past year or two, emerging bio-pharma, we see has increasing funding. With respect to - and also, I would just add a comment that some large pharma, in the context of perhaps more rational evaluation of the portfolios and of the cost structure at the same time, are in-sourcing parts of their development. Now, Next-Gen is largely unaffected by this, because it's new and different. In fact, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we won a preferred provider status with a large pharma that essentially previously had - did not outsource any CRO work. And that's largely on the back of the Next-Gen capabilities. In fact, we even have clients asking us to provide the Next-Gen capability if you will in combination with their resources. And we are evaluating some of those type of hybrid joint partnership models with some of our clients. With respect to revenue accelerating, it's a little bit more than one-year cycle unfortunately. Generally, nice bookings we had this quarter. And again, it was a very strong bookings quarter. I've seen some of your notes, not you particularly, but some of your colleagues' notes and with - again, the math is not quite correct. The bookings are actually very strong this quarter. It's one of the best bookings quarter, the book-to-bill we had in a long time. And so, with acceleration of revenue, we still have to go through the cycle, we had those bad bookings last year. And so we got to cycle through that. And probably through the end of 2018, we will see the benefits of - we start seeing the benefits of the higher bookings this quarter and the previous one. Thank you.
Jack Meehan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Evans: Thank you. Ari, if we look at the Q4 revenue that was implied in your guidance last quarter, it would have been about $2.16 billion at the midpoint. Now that guidance is $2.14 billion at the midpoint, just slightly lower admittedly, but the FX did help you out in the quarter. So I'm just curious what went the other way, what went against you relative to your expectations last quarter?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, with respect to the third quarter, the FX essentially is where we said we will expect it to be when we gave guidance, so not much has helped here. It helps year-over-year. But relative to the guidance we gave, that is - it has not changed. So it didn't help us. We actually came in higher than our guidance on every metric: revenue, EBITDA and EPS for this quarter. The implied - because we came higher, the implied - we never gave guidance for the fourth quarter, but we have the guidance for the year. So, yeah, since the guidance for third quarter was lower than what we came in at, then fourth quarter imply that you would have derived by subtraction, given our guidance for the year would have been a little higher. Because Q3 came higher, then Q3 ends up being a little bit perhaps lower than you would have expected, at the end, for the year I think we have the broad range, talking about revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion. And I think we have now better visibility, again, assuming if everything else is the same, FX is the same, and I think we - if you add the numbers, it's…
Michael McDonnell: [a80.20 to 80.60a] [ph].
Ari Bousbib: Right, it's [a80.20 to 80.60a] [ph]. If you add up the year to date numbers with the guidance, we're providing today for the fourth quarter. Again, if you - the other things that there that change, of course, relative to the original guidance is that we sold Encore. And that Encore business takes out about $25 million of the revenue. So if you go back to the guidance we gave, which we have not - we had not changed the entire year, right, which was $8 billion to $8.1 billion for the full year revenue. We are now at [a80.20 to 80.60a] [ph], but since then we took out $25 million of revenue from the Encore business. So apples to apples, if you're speaking about the midpoint, I know you guys focus on the midpoint, we actually - the number that we provided is higher, again, reflecting the strong performance this quarter and last quarter. Yeah, thank you for the question. It enables me to clarify.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. My question about acquisition contribution in the quarter, if we looked at that 4.3%, constant currency growth rate for the whole company, what would it have been on an organic basis?
Ari Bousbib: Acquisitions contributed about a 1.5 to overall growth. And by the way, on the commercial side, it's about 0.5 point or really less than the growth on the commercial side was from acquisitions. The rest was in R&D. You might recall that we bought in the fourth quarter of last year a company called TKL, a small CRO that focused on dermatology. And so that's some of the acquisition driven contribution to R&D Solutions' growth. We also bought, though it was in some time in the middle of the quarter and it's not huge revenues, but nevertheless it did contribute a little bit, a company called DrugDev, which is included in our R&D Solutions business. And it's an attractive technology platform that it has, we think highly differentiated and very attractive tools for study startup, payments and clinical trial optimization. With this acquisition in the midst of the third quarter and a little bit of revenue, it's very low revenue. We paid a lot of money for it. It's actually the bulk of the spend in the quarter. But it contributed a little bit of revenue as well to R&D Solutions. Okay, I hope that helps and gives you more color.
John Kreger: It does and actually that's a good segue to my follow-up. Ari, I think on the last call you talked about an initiative to sort of build out a suite of clinical data technology tools. Can you just sort of update us on that, what's the plan and does that latest acquisition maybe accelerate that?
Ari Bousbib: The answer is, it does accelerate that. We're building tools internally. We're also collaborating with salesforce.com. So these tools are based on a common platform. And you will hear us on more. You might recall, a much tinier business, but we did acquire a small company called Wingspan, which is for regulated content management, the tool, and very highly complementary with DrugDev, which is more in the area of study startup and payment processing. I'm really looking forward to the investor conference in a couple of weeks, because we plan to demo some of these tools and share more detail about that initiatives, I hope that you can attend.
John Kreger: Great. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib: But also if I may, just add this - we are actually accelerating investments there and we are - that wasn't your question, I just anticipate. We are going a little faster and anticipated on our synergy ramp and on our productivity initiatives. And because of that we feel we can afford the accelerated investments. So net-net as you probably would note, we still are year-over-year even though the compares are hard to do, because we weren't merged company last year, but we have even a little bit of margin expansion year-to-date, I think, it's around 30 basis points of margin expansion. And fourth quarter, we will see maybe a little bit also margin expansion, but not as much again, because we are investing largely in the Next-Gen and in the clinical technology suite that you just referred to. Thank you.
John Kreger: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of RBC. Please proceed with your question.
George Hill: Did the merger with IMS to advance the sales process around real-world evidence and the trial sponsors, and we've seen a lot of other late-stage CROs try to replicate or…
Ari Bousbib: I don't know, what's going on here, but we have a - is that Dave? Who is this?
George Hill: George Hill from RBC.
Ari Bousbib: I'm sorry. We missed the - maybe you were on mute. We missed the beginning of your question. If you don't mind repeating. And by the way, welcome back.
George Hill: It's good to be back. The question was around sales process into trial sponsors around real-world evidence, where you guys have a differentiated offering, given the close of the merger and what you guys are selling now. I guess, can you talk about the competitive environment as you've seen other late-stage CROs, either through partnership or through other types of announcements? It seems like try to replicate or compete on what you're doing in that space. And just, I worry about the - is your sales message and your marketing message kind of getting through and resonating with clients? Or do you feel like there's been an emergence of noise in the space?
Ari Bousbib: Well, yes, it is resonating, and yes, competitors are trying to catch-up and entering our kinds of partnerships and doing acquisitions and so on. And we think that's good, it validates our strategy and elevates the gain for everyone. We still busy, we have truly undifferentiated - truly unparalleled datasets technology platform, frankly, years of experience ahead of the curve. So I think, the message is resonating, yes, of course, there's always noise. People say, well, we also have data, we also have technology, when you peel the onion, though, you'll see the true difference. I mentioned in my remarks that we are starting to see a lot of interest prompted by regulatory actions in the 21st Century Cures Act, which increased the demand for real-world insights. This is about trying to find new indications for existing drugs, and utilizing secondary data and analytics that, frankly, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to provide, we see a lot of demand. So actually the business in the quarter grew double-digit, the real-world business. It's consistent with long-term historical growth rate that we see for real-world certainly on - in the IMS legacy business. And even the late-stage study business at Quintiles grew double-digits in the quarter. On the whole - our outlook for the business remains very strong, and we continue to see synergies on how we go to market, so very positive outlook there.
George Hill: Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up will be any follow-up on selling cycle? Are you seeing a lengthening or shortening of selling cycles relative to the competitive environment or generally steady?
Ari Bousbib: No. Because, it is largely driven by clients and by the idiosyncratic aspects of the study, and as you know it's high process driven, a lot of regulatory issues, pricing, safety, et cetera. So we don't see any delays that's moving or acceleration due to competitive pressures.
George Hill: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Juan Avendano: Hi, this is Juan Avendano on behalf of Derik. You've been pretty diligent at this closing the Next-Gen wins every quarter and we appreciate that. Would you be willing to tell us what percentage of your revenues nowadays, that is orders that you have actually built, are currently from this next generation wins or would all of those orders are still residing the backlog, that is they haven't been burned.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, I mean, look it's - what we disclosed all the awards, so it always takes a little bit of time to get into contract. Today, about three quarters approximately of the Next-Gen awards that we've disclosed. And I said, we have approximately, since the merger $900 million worth of awards. About three quarters of that is in the disclosed backlog, which is contracted. How much of that has translated into revenue, it's a very little so far. I would say of that maybe - I think, it's the high-single-digits maybe 8%. I'd like to look more precisely, but it cannot be more than 7%, 8%.
Juan Avendano: Okay. Thank you. And then just to clarify on the M&A contribution that was about 1.5 in the quarter. Should that be about around run rate that we should expect in future quarters coming up absent of any additional M&A?
Ari Bousbib: Yes. We've said that's part of our guidance, we've always said that acquisitions we present 1 to 2 points of our growth. Now, it can be lumpy. There could be a very rich quarter, where we end up closing a lot of these deals or not. So in this quarter happens to be point and a half, right in the middle of what we usually expect. You could have a quarter, where it's less than one. You could have a quarter, it's more than two. But in general, 1 to 2 points is what we anticipate. It's generally has been historically on the commercial side. Now this past quarter has been mostly on the benefit there has been on the R&D side. And as I said about 0.5 point, or actually less than a 0.5 point of the growth on the commercial side came from acquisitions. The rest was in R&D.
Juan Avendano: Thank you. And lastly, if I may regarding your capital deployment priorities. You've definitely been a lot of repurchases. But now that you've annualized the acquisition of IMS Merger, should we expect an uptick in, perhaps, bolt-on M&A?
Ari Bousbib: No. We - again, we just - we're not buying to buy. We're just buying, because we're building out a strategy behind it. It's all mostly technology based companies that give us unique capabilities, so we can move to next centuries clinical trial processes, and improve - or continue to improve our suite of commercial applications. Number one and number two, when there is a whole in our offerings like in the case of the TKL acquisition on the clinical side, we bought a small CRO. And we are, of course, always looking at that. There aren't that many such opportunities, but we're looking at that. With respect to larger acquisitions, of course, we have an obligation to look at them, and we have and we'll continue to look, when they come up. But in every single case, we've moved away, while we might have wanted to do the acquisition, we moved away, because we felt there was a very large disconnect between the valuation expectation, and what we were prepared to pay. So we'll continue to be very discipline in our capital allocation, as you know, we have a great problem, which is we generate a lot of cash flow. We are very effective repatriating the overseas cash in a tax efficient manner. And we may generate from time-to-time cash from divestiture. So the combination of our operating cash flow, our tax efficient repatriations. Plus we have communicated to you before that the type of net leverage that we have today, which is anywhere between 4 and 4.5, we feel it's an appropriate capital structure for a business of our type and our cash flow profile, and risk characteristics. Given the current rate environment, again, our average cost of debt after tax is just over 2%. So it will be really uneconomic to - for us to pay down debt with our extra cash. So absent incremental CapEx internally, or absent acquisitions beyond 1% to 2%. You're going to see us continue to actively do share repurchase, which we feel is an efficient way to return cash to our shareholders, and we believe the stock is very underpriced and is a great value.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Windley: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Are you talked early in the integration process about applicability of Next-Gen. And I think, you've started at, say, 20% of the trials that you would see, I think, maybe since then you've perhaps up to that percentage. But I wondered with the kind of time under your belt at this point, how broadly do you think the Next-Gen data and strategy is applicable to the trial universe that you see in your sales funnel?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. The - what we believe today, is that Next-Gen capabilities are applicable to 50% to 60% of the trials. And one of the reasons that we've upped that number since the merger is, because what's in the pipeline of the molecules is more and more a complex stuff, a specialty oncology diabetes, very tight area, CV or otherwise, where the patient population is very scarce. And again, this is all about accelerating patient site identification and patient enrollment. And again, I invite you to attend our investor conference in a couple of weeks, we plan to demo and go through a number of case studies, so you'll see the value. Now I should add that the reason why we don't think it's applicable to 100%, it's not, because it's not doable. It simply because it has no value for the balance of the pipeline that is you don't need to deploy those tools, it's a pretty well-known therapy area. Everyone knows where the sites of the patients are, and based on empirical data, and it's not that complicated, that's not the issue in those trials. But I think - we think that we can have - we can generate great value in 50% to 60% of the portfolio. I'd finally say that we also are applying Next-Gen tools to existing ongoing trials, where recruitment is falling behind, including in studies where we were brought in to replace an existing CRO that was underperforming. So that actually has been great, but it's been a little bit of distraction in terms of delaying, in terms of resources and so on. So we've been actually recruiting faster and more than we had anticipated in terms of the ramp on Next-Gen.
David Windley: You read my mind. That's a great segue. And my follow-up question was going to be around application to existing backlog. And I'm wondering, if on a - taking your backlog in totality and thinking about the projects that are actually in flight now. Is that application of the data to existing backlog something that has influenced backlog conversion in the last couple of quarters, because it has bounced off of a bottom in the first quarter? Or would you say that it still kind of noise and I shouldn't over interpret that.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, I think, it's the latter. I mean, in theory, the answer would be yes, but there aren't enough trials to make a real dent. Yeah, it's maybe in the rounding. We have a $10 billion plus backlog. So there is a lot - this is a very large company. This is - it's always very hard to compare our company to competitors in one segment of our business or another, because it's a large company. We have a huge backlog and lots of trials at any given point in time. But it doesn't take much today, referred to our resources, even one trial. And so, that, yes, certainly, revenue conversion is accelerated when we bring in Next-Gen. Just that - we've seen that over and over again. Well, the impact it has on conversion in aggregate, it's hard to see in the numbers, yet.
David Windley: Okay. One last question, quickly. I appreciate your comments on capital deployment that's very helpful. I'm wondering, if you're running into any limitations with regard to geography of cash, and how you think about tax reform and whether that matters to you and your ability to potentially repatriate cash from ex-U.S.?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, I think we got a good point, we do have, and we've run in those limitations in the past, but repatriated quite a bit of cash. Obviously, there is a tax reforms that enable us to do this in an even better manner and a faster way. And of course, we'll take advantage of that. But as you know, these days, it's hard to predict what we know would not happen in one year. So, I'll - maybe I'll give Mike an opportunity to answer this.
Michael McDonnell: Yeah. So Dave, as Ari indicated, we obviously, we're watching tax reforms just like every other corporation in the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, we had a significant amount of cash on hand, about $1.1 billion, and the majority of that is overseas. And we've repatriated about a $1 billion, since the merger, and we'll continue to repatriate as tax efficiently as we can. And obviously, we're watching tax reform. And to the extent that the U.S. tax rates are decreased that can only make our repatriation efforts that much more efficient. So we're watching that, and hopefully, we'll give upside if that were to come through.
David Windley: Super. I appreciate to taking my questions. Thank you.
Michael McDonnell: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please proceed.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks for all the comments today. I honestly did not want to ask a question here on book-to-bill, but Ari, something you said is going to make me have to bite my tongue and do it.
Ari Bousbib: Great.
Eric Coldwell: And I know, you're trying to move away from the quarterly figure, but you're dealing with a bunch of guys here that have covered you a - the space for a long time, and we're kind of stuck in our middle rut.
Ari Bousbib: Sure. Sure.
Eric Coldwell: I think, you said, bookings were up 40% year-over-year versus the third quarter of last year. And you can tell me if that's correct or incorrect. But if it is correct, then mathematically at least based on our model and our interpretation of what was previously said, that would put a book-to-bill this quarter of around 1.25. But I actually thought the book-to-bill was a little better. So it's just such an important topic for investors that they sort of try to see the traction of Quintiles versus the peers and with Next-Gen rolling out. I'm hoping you can give us a little more color. And then finally, I'll go ahead and ask my add on, I know probably not a big impact from acquired backlog from the two deals mentioned, but maybe foreign currency had a bigger influence with the revaluation of backlog, so you could give us that number as well.
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, okay, thanks for the question and I think the…
Eric Coldwell: Thank you. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Look, obviously, as we said, we previously told you that we tried to get you off this quarterly book to bill going forward. We made an exception by the way last quarter, because we feel it's appropriate once in a while to clarify the numbers and we thought we had given you enough points that that enables you then to understand what it is in any given quarter and also it was focused under the method since the merger and we thought it was appropriate to do so. Now, you're right, FX can also skew the number. And it's - I have to tell you, it's not simple math when you look at the FX implications, simply because every quarter is a different set of FX numbers. And then we also revalue the backlog at the end of the quarter, where in fact the revenue is the average FX every single day during the quarter. So the numbers are hard to interpret per se in a quarter. And the trend is more important. Now, if you do simple match on the reported numbers, okay, that you do the - you take the end-of-quarter backlog minus last-year backlog, and adjust for revenue, then the math gives you 1.35 book-to-bill in the quarter, that thus include FX. And I'll tell you now, it's what it is, but that in a sense reflects what is in the numbers. That if you assume that FX are not going to change at all going forward, then that's what you have in the backlog in terms of understanding the future of the business, that's about 1.35 for the quarter. Now, if you want to look at comparisons across quarters we believe that you should look at the different numbers we gave you in the past. And if you do that and you look at the numbers this quarter in terms of progression you probably going to calculate 1.25. Now, neither so - but the real number, to answer your question, is in between that 1.25 and 1.35, closer to the 1.25 as you suggested, for the quarter on a - if we take out all FX from every single number. So that enables you to compare the quarters in a clean manner as best as we can do. Okay, so somewhere between the 1.25 and the 1.35. So you are - yeah, it's your question, you said 1.26, the answer is, yeah, you're in the ZIP code. Now, you also asked about acquisition. I told you TKL was, yeah, the TKL acquisition was largely what affected those acquisition contribution in the quarter for the R&D Solutions business, and of course, it is in the backlog.
Eric Coldwell: That's great. And I just want to - last one, can you hear me?
Ari Bousbib: Okay.
Eric Coldwell: Can you hear me now?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.
Eric Coldwell: Okay, yeah, I just want to clarify. Last quarter was a 1.3, but a 1.37 with the FX and this quarter was 1.25 without the FX and 1.35 with, is that the right interpretation?
Ari Bousbib: No, it's higher than 1.25. I'm just going to stick with - I'm telling you the exact number. It's higher than the 1.25, but it's in the range between 1.25 and 1.35.
Eric Coldwell: Got it, were good enough. Thank you so much.
Ari Bousbib: Thank you. Thanks for the question. Maybe one last question?
Andrew Markwick: Yeah, we got time for one more question, operator.
Operator: Okay. And our last question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Sandy Draper: [Technical Difficulty] very much for squeezing me in. As usual, lot of questions on the development side, but [Technical Difficulty] the commercial side. Ari, yeah, the business [Technical Difficulty] single digits that you've historically got some headwinds, about…
Andrew Markwick: Sandy, we're struggling to hear you on our end. Can you start again?
Sandy Draper: Okay. Is this better, can you hear me?
Andrew Markwick: It's kind of muffled, I don't know if you got bad reception.
Sandy Draper: I may have bad reception. I'll try and if you can't understand…
Ari Bousbib: Oh, that's better. Go ahead, yeah.
Sandy Draper: Yeah, so my question is on the commercial side. You clearly - there are some pretty clear signs on the development side about business improving and accelerating. My question is you got some lassy [ph] drag on the commercial side and [Technical Difficulty] indications that that this is going to accelerate or [Technical Difficulty] longer term, that's a low best-case maybe mid-single-digit business, just any thoughts on that, Ari, would be helpful, thank you.
Ari Bousbib: Okay. I'm not quite sure if I understood all your questions, because you're being cut off and we are missing one out of few words. But you asked about commercial revenue, if I understand correctly. And I just want to point out that in terms of the commercial side of your house versus the R&D development side, again, in the spirit of just clarifying, perhaps, misunderstandings, when we put the company together, we as best as we could, gave you the contours of each of the businesses. And you will recall that we aggregated some of commercial businesses, legacy Quintiles into your legacy IMS commercial businesses. But since then, few things have happened. First, there was a small clinical trials technology business at IMS. It was about $20 million of revenue in total. And we move that since then from commercial to R&D. Secondly, there was also small legacy IMS CSO business, contracted sales business in Eastern Europe, which was $5 million or so of revenue. And we move that to IES. And finally, as you know, we sold the Encore business, which removed 25 - actually more than $25 million of revenue from the second half. So our commercial business versus what it was when we merged the companies and told you what commercial looked like, that commercial business lost $50 million of revenue between the transfer of businesses out and the sale of the Encore business. So that as starters. And in terms of the growth in commercial, actually even absent these adjustments you will see that we continue to see robust growth. Your core IMS business historically has been growing at about 6% annually and that was inclusive of one to two points of acquisitions. And it's exactly been performing the same since the beginning of the merger. So no changes there at all. And as I told you, this quarter actually with acquisition contribution is relatively minor, so good organic growth which is usually in the 4% type range, historically has been maintained more or less since the merger. So that was exactly your question, but I just wanted to provide more color on commercial revenue. And I think there is one more question, maybe the last question.
Andrew Markwick: Yeah, I think we got one more person in the queue. So if we can take one more, operator.
Operator: Yes, our last question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Ari, I want to explore the concept of fixed price contracts. This has come up a little bit in the last couple of quarters. Just curious as to where you are on rolling out fixed price contracts and if you can give any commentary on how much of the backlog now is fixed price?
Ari Bousbib: Yeah, look, I want to - it's really the few deals, okay? It's not a large percentage of the backlog. I would say, less than, let's see, the platform is $10 million. So it's a fraction, really a fraction, because we just started, okay. So it's very small. Yet, I anticipate this is going to growth though. We're not going to disclose exactly how much of our new business is fixed every time. But we have previously said that we are applying so far Next-Gen to about 20% of what we look at. And of that, a portion of this is fixed price, okay? Maybe call it a third, okay, to give you a rough estimate. So of the new stuff, about - 20% of pipeline and then we look at, that doesn't mean that we win every time. But that's what, over time as I said, we hope to apply Next-Gen to 50% to 60% of the pipe. And I'm assuming that, again, about a third of that will be fixed price. Now, our case is though, we don't want it to be fixed price. There are cases, I said before, we are hybrid. That is we sell technology capabilities and up-front work separately. And that's a fixed price and then we sell other services, data or otherwise that are not fixed price. Again, we are experimenting with these new models. But we are seeing a lot of traction, a lot of interest. It often is a clincher of the deal at the end, right, because we are willing to take more risk.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, and then just for a follow-up just a quick clarification, on the investments you're calling on the Next-Gen CRO development. Is the right way to think about that being offset by the cost synergies from the integration? I'm just thinking ahead a little bit to 2018 in margins, or whether it would be kind of incremental investments that you bear around Next-Gen development that could weigh on margins a bit next year?
Ari Bousbib: Right, so, Next-Gen investments are the bulk. You remember we have the salesforce.com replatforming. So, on the commercial side we also had investments. And then we have also salesforce recruitment to try to accelerate our business development activities on R&D. And the combination of all of that are the investments that we made. We are also carrying additional costs, as a result of the merger. We've been carrying additional costs throughout the year, but these are costs that we cannot adjust-out. These are - in cases where we have to maintain redundant people, redundant facilities for a while, redundant IT systems and software licenses. All of that needs to be maintained as we transition to one or the other or a new one. And so, that creates a bucket of cost and we cannot adjust that out, because it's not a one-time kind of a merger specific outside cost. It's just redundant parallel cost, when we take it out then it goes away, and it's been taken out over time. So these are all the headwinds. Despite all of that, as I pointed out before, year to date we have margin expansion. Listen, as I said, before I'd like to say we are in the business of growing revenue and expanding margins, not one or the other. There might be some quarters where you don't have margin expansion. But my goal is certainly to have margin expansion and I anticipate that 2018 will not be an exception to that despite all the investments that I just mentioned.
Tycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.
Andrew Markwick: Okay, I think that's about all we have time for today. So thank you for taking the time to join us. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. We'll be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Analysts: Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Quintiles IMS Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 3, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our Quintiles IMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call could include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2017 and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the Quintiles IMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. Let's review the quarter. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.97 billion. This revenue included $871 million for Commercial Solutions, $896 million for R&D Solutions, and $204 million for Integrated Engagement Services. Adjusted EBITDA for the company was also close to the high end of our guidance range at $486 million. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points for the quarter. Let me provide some color behind the numbers. Let's start with our technology solutions business. Our tech business continues to gain traction in the market. Let me illustrate with a few examples. During the quarter, we signed two significant deals with top 10 pharma clients for our social media technology platform for over $12 million. As a reminder, our social media technology mines and analyzes over 400,000 social media outlets to track patient sentiment. It specifically flags adverse events to help clients rapidly identify and remediate issues when they arise, and satisfy regulatory reporting requirements. We do this through proprietary ontology in 52 languages; proprietary algorithms; 24/7, 365 days of the year in a state-of-the-art global monitoring center. We also had significant wins with our Master Data Management or MDM platform amounting to about $20 million with top 20 pharma clients. The clients will deploy our MDM Solution globally, benefiting from Quintiles IMS' global implementation services, which are unmatched by our competitors. Finally, in another illustration of progress in our technology business, we issued a press release on June 26 highlighting the launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering. The OCE offering will be released towards the end of the year. We are, in fact, accelerating investments in our Salesforce.com partnership to replatform our global CRM and MCM solutions. Stay tuned for new product releases including in the clinical space. Switching to our real-world insights business where we also landed a few significant wins during the quarter. First, a $15 million real-world project with a top 10 pharma client. This particular win in cardiovascular leveraged a direct-to-patient data-driven approach that enabled us to shorten timelines and accelerate patient recruitment for the project. The second multimillion-dollar win I want to highlight in our real-world business is with a top biotech company where we displaced the existing preferred provider for a first-in-class new-to-market product. Here, we applied a differentiated approach by linking primary sites and investigators' data from legacy Quintiles with existing secondary claims data from legacy IMS, a capability that is unmatched by our competitors. Moving to our R&D business. We saw continued improvements and another quarterly sequential increase in our as-contracted bookings. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of just under $10 billion; to be precise, $9.990 billion. Now, I know there is a lot of discussion about market trends in the R&D space and in the CRO space, so let me tell you what we see in the market. On a macro level, the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to increase across all stages of the pipeline. The number of molecules in Phase I, II, and III are at their highest levels since at least 2001. FDA approvals in 2017 are tracking well ahead of 2016. As you all know, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has signaled policy and regulatory shifts that we believe will support life sciences innovation, potentially accelerating clinical developments and reducing regulatory risk. On a micro level at Quintiles IMS, and in addition to these underlying market forces, integration efforts are enabling us to rethink how operations are conducted, and we are laser-focused on modernizing the approach we take to many of the traditional CRO processes. We are, in fact, winning business with clients that the legacy Quintiles organization had done very little R&D work with in the past, and we have specifically secured wins with previously locked-out accounts. Now, you are familiar with our Next-Gen clinical development offering. It's been instrumental in supporting these wins. In fact, more than $600 million of awards since the merger have leveraged Next-Gen capabilities. We are also winning with emerging biopharma clients, and I'd like to give a couple examples of Next-Gen EBP wins that, in combination, have a value of $50 million. The first example is a win in Asia where the client selected us because of our ability to provide an end-to-end solution from evidence-driven protocol design to precision site ID. The second example is a sole provider win in Europe which was driven by our ability to leverage our real-world data, advanced analytics, and domain expertise in combination to answer the client's strategic therapeutic questions in COPD and asthma. I also want to provide a quick update on progress with the $120 million fixed-price award that we won with a top 5 pharma client last quarter and which we discussed on the call. To-date, we greatly exceeded all of the legacy Quintiles historical timeline benchmarks across all geographies. In fact, the client awarded us two additional multi-million dollar full-service contracts in other therapeutic areas during the quarter, demonstrating their confidence in our solutions. As a reminder, legacy Quintiles had done virtually no full-service clinical work with this client over the previous six-year period. Now, the traction we see in the marketplace for our Next-Gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in Next-Gen operationalization and resourcing plans. Once again, we see that in each of our business the basis for our differentiation continues to be our integrated approach to rich data, new technologies, advanced analytics, and significant domain expertise. Now, of course, we're striving to be best-in-class with each of these capabilities. But what truly sets us apart is the way we integrate these capabilities across the portfolio to bring highly-differentiated solutions within each of the clinical and commercial markets we operate in. Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to announce that we are holding an Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City later this year. Please hold the date of November 8. We're planning a morning event, probably running from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. And as this will be shortly after our third quarter earnings call, the focus will not be on the numbers but on the long-term strategy and progress of the business. The day will highlight some of our technology capabilities, and we'll be more comprehensive than the demos some of you have already seen. More importantly, this will give you all an opportunity to meet a broader cross-section of management. We're looking forward to this event and hope you can all attend. With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details. As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Second quarter revenue was $1.97 billion which was the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. You will recall the deferred revenue adjusted we highlighted on the last couple of calls. This quarter, it negatively impacted revenue by $2 million. When adjusting for this, and on a combined company basis, second quarter revenue grew 1.2% at constant currency and 0.1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions' revenue of $871 million grew just under 2% at constant currency and 0.6% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles' Encore business and headwinds from the legacy Quintiles' Advisory Consulting business. Excluding Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was about 2.5% at constant currency. We sold the Encore business after the close of the second quarter and recorded an impairment charge in Q2 to reflect the sales price. This business is not part of our strategic vision. And as a result of the sale, we will have some tax benefits. R&D Solutions' service revenue of $896 million grew 1.7% at constant currency and 0.4% at actual FX rates. Growth was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations in the third quarter of 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth at constant currency was about 3%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $204 million declined 2.1% at constant currency and 3.7% at actual FX rates. Revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a one-time $9 million royalty acceleration in 2016. Turning now to profits. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% expanded 100 basis points. GAAP net income was $75 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income was $242 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the quarter. Now let's turn to the results for the first half. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First half revenue was just under $3.9 billion. Adjusting for deferred revenue, and on a combined company basis, first half revenue grew 2.2% at constant currency and 1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions' revenue of $1.72 billion grew 2.1% at constant currency and 0.9% reported. Excluding Encore, Commercial Solutions' growth was about 3% at constant currency. R&D Solutions' service revenue of $1.76 billion grew 2.9% at constant currency and 1.7% at actual FX rates. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth was 4% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $400 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Turning to R&D Solutions' net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, R&D Solutions' as-contracted bookings were $4.03 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.99 billion. We expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. As you know, we began reporting our bookings on an as-contracted basis rather than an as-awarded basis. This approach began with the third quarter of 2016 which was the last quarter of Quintiles' stand-alone reporting. As we now have four quarters on the as-contracted approach, we feel that it is appropriate to provide some additional color on the bookings. As you can see from the chart, our bookings trend has improved steadily each quarter since we closed the merger. For the last 12 months since we started reporting as-contracted, the book-to-bill is 1.14. Looking at the last nine months since we closed the merger and began reporting on a combined basis, the book-to-bill is 1.21. Looking at the last six months since the beginning of 2017, the year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.24. And looking at this quarter, we had a book-to-bill of 1.30. Now, if you were to back-calculate the book-to-bill in the quarter by taking the difference in backlog and backing out revenue, you would get a book-to-bill in the quarter of 1.37. This includes a small positive benefit from the revaluation of the entire ending backlog at spot FX rates at the end of the quarter. We feel that using, for bookings, the same average rate used for revenue over the quarter is a better indication of actual activity in the quarter, allows for more consistent comparisons across periods, and in this case is more conservative. Turning now to profit for the first half of the year. First half adjusted EBITDA was $953 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6% expanded 50 basis points. GAAP net income was $149 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65 for the first six months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $480 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 in the first half of the year. Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $902 million, and debt was about $9 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.1 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $245 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $100 million, and free cash flow was $145 million. During the second quarter, the board approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion to $3.5 billion. We repurchased $300 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder at the end of May. And towards the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $78 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $378 million of repurchases during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had $853 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization. Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05. You will recall that we also increased the 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.05 last quarter. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion; and adjusted diluted EPS to between $4.50 and $4.65, up from $4.45 to $4.60. The basis for our adjusted diluted EPS raise is a change in our adjusted book tax rate expectations. To date, our adjusted book tax rate has been approximately 29%, and we anticipate it will remain at this level for the rest of the year. This incremental 1% benefit below the line will increase our adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 for the year. For our cash tax rate, we now expect approximately 15% for the year, down from our previous guidance of approximately 16%. For the third quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2 billion and $2.03 billion, reflecting the general strength of the business. Adjusted EBITDA to be between $500 million and $515 million, reflecting continued operational improvements offset by accelerated investments in Next-Gen capability development, as Ari mentioned, as well as accelerated investments in Salesforce.com's CRM and MCM replatforming efforts in anticipation of the upcoming product launch later this year. And adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.10 and $1.15. In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered on our financial commitments. We are investing in all areas of the business for future growth. We are making progress with the Salesforce.com alliance, and we remain excited about upcoming product releases for both clinical and commercial technology. We have a strong R&D Solutions pipeline. Next-Gen continues to gain traction with new wins in the quarter, and we continue to deploy our capital effectively and have bought back $2.7 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $78.81 since we closed the merger. With that, I would like to ask Alex to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tim Evans with the company Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey. Thank you, gentlemen. So just using a cash flow statement as a proxy, you spent over $250 million on acquisitions in the first half of the year which is a pretty sizeable outlay. Can you just talk about these a little bit? What did you do? What segments were they in? How much did they contribute to growth in the first half? And how much revenue are they expected to add for the full year? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Tim. Thanks for your question. This is Ari. In the quarter, I think we spent $118 million in acquisitions. We continuously look for and have a rich pipeline of small tuck-in capability acquisitions. These are, for the most part, and I want to say exclusively this year, technology acquisitions both in the commercial space and in the clinical space. This quarter, there were a few handful of small acquisitions, all of which closed at the end of the quarter, and had zero impact in the quarter. As we've told you before, we may pay a healthy premium because, again, we're buying the technology capabilities. It's a decision to continue to develop our assets through acquisitions instead of internal product development spend. Initially, these acquisitions have very little revenue contribution, and the acquisition spend can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but that's what we've signaled before; it's not rich. And we expect to answer your question in terms of contribution to revenue, that acquisitions will contribute year in, year out of 1 point to 1.5 point to our growth, and this year won't be different.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then the CapEx spending...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: And by the way, this will be true both for R&D and Commercial, just to be complete. Go ahead.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. So I was just going to say the CapEx in the quarter was up sequentially by a fairly meaningful amount. Is that the run rate we should expect going forward kind of on your quarterly CapEx?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Mike?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: So, Tim, it's Mike speaking. Overall, yeah, it did tick up a little bit. I would attribute that more to timing if you compare the first quarter to the second quarter. And I would say that, in general, we continue to see ourselves as a company that is not capital-intensive. The combined company should run at about 4% of revenue in general, and early on it could be a little bit higher in the early years as we integrate the two businesses. Year-to-date, we're about 4.5%. And I think the first quarter, second quarter is strictly timing.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with the company Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. It looks like you've shown some good momentum in terms of the net new business awards. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the recent cancellation activity, how things have gone since the end of the first quarter, and anything notable there.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, I mean, every quarter we have cancellations. Bear in mind, we moved to an as-contracted basis, and that's the same for cancellations, right? So it could be that there was a cancellation a quarter or two ago and we took it in this quarter. So we had, as in every quarter, cancellations this quarter as well. In terms of contracted, nothing of significance in terms of, in the quarter, new cancellations. The cancellations we took, and that are reflected in our numbers, are cancellations that were announced in prior periods. Nothing of significance this quarter. You know we have a very dispersed client base, and there is at the moment not any given trial that will materially impact us.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful commentary. And then just one in terms of progress and in terms of the cost synergies. It looked like you shared some good leverage there in the second quarter with the higher revenue. Just do you have any additional thoughts on the pacing for getting to the $200 million over the next few years, that will be helpful. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yes. I mean, we've said that it's really starting to kick in in 2018, and there is a ramp. Our goal is to get to our a couple of $100 million of cost synergies, merger-related cost synergies at the end of 2019 in terms of a run rate. So, yeah, that's the ramp. I mean, in terms of – I don't know if we gave – it's not linear as you know, right? I mean, we will have some benefit in 2018, and then it will ramp in 2019, and we get to our $200 million run rate at the exiting 2019. Is it going the way we anticipate? In some area it's going faster and in some areas, as always, slower. There are a lot of moving parts. Some of the real estate consolidations in some countries are easy to do, others are more difficult. Some of the IT systems again in HR, it's going well on the financial side. We have some delays, but again nothing that's unusual. All in all, I think we have good visibility and we're tracking on our plans.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Ari.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with the company Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Don't take this as a critique at all. But technically, at least compared to those of us on the sell-side, you did push out revenue and EBITDA expectations quarterly throughout the year but you also maintained your revenue and EBITDA guidance for the year. So it does put a lot more attention on the fourth quarter. And with that lead-in, my question is or maybe my ask is help convince me and others that the fourth quarter is, in fact, going to be a strong quarter. And how do you get to your guidance for the full year? What are the inputs in the fourth quarter that really stand out for you both in terms of revenue and EBITDA? And I might have one follow-up. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay, Eric. I know you have a follow-up for sure. So, look, the guidance we gave is based on our forecast both for every time we did so for the quarter and for the year. Our guidance in revenue and EBITDA has a range, and that range has not changed. As always, there are puts and takes aspects in the business that are doing better than we thought and others that are perhaps weaker than we have anticipated. We also, as you know, got rid of the Encore business earlier this month or last month, and so it won't be in our numbers any longer, so that piece of the revenue is out. Flip side of this, we have a little bit – assuming FX rates remains where they are – we may have a little bit of tailwind from FX which will offset that loss of revenue. And bear in mind, the FX rate is rather a headwind on EBITDA rather than a tailwind, that it may be on revenue simply because we do a lot of work overseas. And at the EPS line, we are hedged largely because we've got also euro-denominated currencies. And the FX movements are very complicated because of the number of countries in which we do business and the large number of currencies that are fluctuating constantly. So with respect to your specific question in terms of the ramp, look, there are some merger-related costs that we've had throughout the first two quarters, and we believe will continue in the third quarter. I've said before, there are redundant costs that we continue to carry that we cannot adjust out of the P&L, of our adjusted EBITDA numbers. Those are going to continue in the third quarter, and a portion of those we're going to be able to remove in the fourth quarter. So that's one aspect. Secondly, when we planned for the year we had anticipate a progression of our investments in both the R&D side and the technology side. We are actually accelerating some of these investments and our resourcing plan, and so the third quarter carries some of that. In a sense, it's some of the investment that had been planned in Q4 will take place in Q3. That's another reason why you might see a bigger ramp than you might have otherwise anticipated. We also announced the Salesforce.com initiative/alliance which, again, we had not anticipated earlier in the year, and that is causing us to invest more in people and software development and so on. And again, all of that is also accelerating because we now believe we'll be able to launch the products towards the end of the year. So all of that affects, if you will, the ramp on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, but nothing unusual. Each of those is a relatively small number in isolation, and it's the accumulation of that that perhaps gives you the sense that it's a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Ari, did I also understand at one point I think in a past conversation you might've mentioned or perhaps it was Mike that mentioned you might've had some contract timing issues in the fourth quarter. I know you've talked about seasonality, but are there any unusual contract timing events?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Well, again, for those of you less familiar with the IMS, the IMS commercial business traditionally, Q4 traditionally has a seasonality element to it. It's the end of the year and pharma has budgets, marketing and commercial budgets that they look to spend, and the fourth quarter typically has been the strongest. A lot of purchases of what we call ad hoc data packages. Most of that comes at the end of the year. So if you look historically, the IMS legacy business is weaker in the third quarter. The seasonality of Q3 has been the weakest historically, and Q4 the strongest. So that will explain also perhaps the perception of a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for all the answers. My quick follow-up, if I'm allowed, is just – I'm sorry if I missed it but I'd love to get an update on your sales and marketing head count and development of your teams in the field. Maybe a qualitative as well as quantitative commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the question and thanks for bringing this up. We have said before that we – and I'm assuming you're asking primarily on the R&D side which is where we felt that we were – Commercial is perhaps been not as forceful and aggressive as we could have been historically.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's correct.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: So I think we had around 150 salespeople historically in the R&D business, and it's not easy to ramp-up to where we want to be but we have increased that number materially by probably about 50% at this point. And secondly, we have also trained – as you know, we've said before we've reorganized our go-to-market strategy globally, and we have regionalized the go-to-market approaches in North America, Europe, and Asia, and we have combined our account management across clinical and commercial markets. We have, in the process, trained 1,000 legacy IMS salespeople on R&D, business development, so they are helping us opening doors, create the meetings that otherwise would simply not have been open to the legacy Quintiles organization before. They are able to engage in conversations, learn about RFPs earlier in the process, and involve then the domain experts from the R&D organization at the right time. So, again, in terms of numbers, specifically we continue to ramp-up the sales force recruitment dedicated to R&D. We've increased that sales force that's dedicated and specialized by about 50% to-date. And we have also trained 1,000 IMS salespeople in at least the earlier stages of business development and sales for R&D as well. Thanks for your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with the company William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Ari, I think in the past you've talked about fully automating E360 by around year end. Could you just give us an update on where that process stands? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for the question, John. Look, when we say – what we really wanted to do, there's always an element of customization, right? Every study is unique. What we wanted to do, and we've said this upfront, is to try to "productionize" the process, to accelerate our response time and minimize the degree of customization. Again, there will always be an element of customization. We are well on our way by the end of the year to having "productionized", which means having loaded the data and standardized the data mining and algorithms required to accelerate site identification, optimal site identification for a given protocol design for a dozen main therapies. The issue is how fast can you go across all specific diseases and therapies. So we think that this is going to cover probably 80% to 90% of the RFPs in which we believe Next-Gen will be relevant and useful, which as we said before is at least half of the pipeline. So that's where we are today and this is exactly where we wanted to be. The biggest hurdle is to recruit the type of people that we need. Today, we have 110, I think, the last time I saw, people in what we call the AOCE, Advanced Analytics Center of Excellence (sic) [ACOE, Analytics Center of Excellence], and that's the full-time dedicated team. The ACOE, I'm sorry. I don't remember what it stands for but – Advanced Analytics Center of Excellence (sic) [Analytics Center of Excellence] which we have created, reporting to Cyndi Verst and led by Natalia Balko who some of you have met. We have this team of over 100 people, full-time, working on the operationalization of how we respond to RFPs where we think Next-Gen has relevance. Bear in mind, we are also trying to use Next-Gen in the existing set of trials that we are working on, and it's really the same team. So at this time, the main constraint to even going faster than we have thought is simply the ability to recruit the type of people we want. I mean, we're really hiring data scientists, statisticians, software development people, and it is just not so easy to recruit globally. But we're making good progress.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then a follow-up. I think you'd suggested that this data would help you have more confidence in RFPs and bidding and, therefore, experimenting with fixed-price awards. It sounds like that first big one is going very well. Are you rolling that strategy out more broadly in awards that you've had in the last three months?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yes, we are. Again, we will speak some more about this at our November Investor Day. We aim for nothing short of disrupting the way clinical trials are conducted. Historically, this is an industry that's paid for inefficiency, and the biggest problem in healthcare is inefficiency over inefficiency. People are paid for time. And without knocking on any specific profession, the longer it takes – it's like lawyers. The longer it takes, the more time you take and the more money you make, the more costs you have because it's essentially a cost-plus type of business model from an economic standpoint. The more costs you have, the more wastes you have, the more rework you have, the more change orders you have, the more revenue you generate. And so there is kind of an inherent conflict in the industry when no one wants to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, and damage their business model. Well we want to change that. We believe that with more visibility, more predictability, more data-enabled and technology-enabled processes, you can actually share risk with clients in a better way with more visibility, an educated risk, and we are willing to do it. And our early forays into this business model change showed that clients are A, much more receptive, and B, see the results in trials that are very complex like the one I discussed before. Again, this is not just a hurdle to overcome because the whole industry is based on a different type of business model. Clients are accustomed to this business differently, and even our own people are accustomed to this business differently. So it's more of a cultural overhaul that we need, and we believe strongly in this vision and we want to move forward. It's too early to show you metrics because we don't have enough of those, and as you know it's a long cycle business. So even if we win a trial today, it's going to take time. Now this particular trial is very large, very complex. It's with a previously locked – essentially locked-out account. And there are many people competing in the same therapy, so an oncology therapy, and so psych identification is even more difficult, and we're beating all timelines historically and we're specifically tracking. Now, one trial is not enough to make it a science, but we feel very confident. And hopefully over time we'll develop enough our database to support the thesis, and I can tell you clients are extremely receptive to our vision.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sounds very good. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with the company SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks very much and good morning. A question, Ari, in terms of the IMS technology side. Just trying to think about the product roadmap. I remember, I don't know, a year and a half, maybe two years ago, you guys were talking about, after the Cegedim acquisition, the new internet platform, and you had gotten a little traction with some smaller biotechs I think on the CRM side, and were really targeting the potential renewal cycle that was going to be coming up in 2018. As you now have the Salesforce partnership, does that change things? I'm just trying to think about where the product strategy and cycle is in terms of that upcoming replacement cycle and what you really see, the opportunities for you guys over in 2018 and 2019 on the technology side of IMS. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Sandy, you're correct. When we bought Cegedim – and by the way acquired or developed internally a number of technology platforms – we intended fully to try and regain some of the market share losses of the historical legacy Cegedim organization. Just for a reminder, we're number two in the specifically-defined, narrowly-defined CRM market. Cegedim had been number one historically going back 5 to 10 years, and they were in the market with an on-premise, heavy, now obsolete type of platform, and we had introduced Mobile Intelligence which was a SaaS-based platform. However, over time, as you recall, because we have a wide suite of applications, we saw the need for a new type of offering that would integrate marketing insights with sales data across several platforms and made those interoperable. Now, in so doing, because we had developed applications on a lot of different platforms and we had internally developed platforms and acquired platforms, in order to integrate all of these applications the cost to do so and the speed to market were very high. We decided to replatform everything on horizontal, existing off-the-shelf industry platforms. We considered several options, and we ended up building an alliance with SFDC with which we are extremely pleased in terms of how it's playing out. And that alliance, by the way, extends to the clinical space as well. We believe this will enable us even better to recapture market share specifically in the CRM business with our upcoming OCE SaaS application. Again, when a doctor reads a marketing e-mail from a pharma company, the sales rep that visits these doctors doesn't know today that the doctor read the e-mail because the marketing system and the sales system are not interoperable. But with our platform, we find when the doctor read the e-mail, whether there was a specific reaction. We find the rep that has that doctor in their territory. And if the doctor is in that rep's call log within the next seven days, we can immediately notify that rep. Again, it's a much more targeted precision sales performance that we are looking for. And it's really the next generation of commercial applications, and we believe that this will enable us to recapture market share in the tech space.
Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I appreciate the response.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you for your questions. Maybe we have time for one more question.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: One more question.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. One more.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with the company Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. I guess just to go back to the Next-Gen booking. It sounds like an additional $200 million since the last update. So about 20%, I guess, of this quarter's bookings. Can you maybe just dig in a little more, Ari, on where these wins are coming from? Are these existing clients? Are they clients who've already started to leverage Next-Gen or are they brand new kind of greenfield opportunities? Just trying to get a better sense of where you're seeing success with the Next-Gen offering.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, actually, a couple of those wins that I remember because I was personally involved total, I want to say, about $35 million or $40 million, and they are with previously locked-out accounts, that is large top 10 pharma clients with whom the legacy Quintiles organization had done zero business over the past 10 years; I think 11 is actually one of them. So the answer is it's coming from all over the place. We don't have – again, in terms of the pace and the ramp, it's been not quite linear; it's actually been accelerating. If you take out the $120 million large deal that we talked about in the previous quarter, it's over $500 million of awards and it's been accelerating as a proportion of the total bookings. And it's really all over. It's EBP wins, it's with locked-out accounts, and it's – from low-size to mid-size type of awards.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you for taking the time to join us today, everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2017 earnings call. Matt Pfister and I will be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the QuintilesIMS First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 3, 2017. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McDonnell, Execution Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following – after this call on the Events & Presentations section of our QuintilesIMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2017 and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would like to also point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Out of the gate, we had a strong start to 2017. We are pleased Q1 results came in, in line or better than what we told you to expect. Let's have a quick review of the numbers. Consistent with last quarter, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, as if the merger had taken place January 1, 2016. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion and grew 3.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions growth was 4.3% at constant currency, and R&D Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed the facility in London last year. Excluding this early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been about 5.5%. Commercial Solutions grew 2.5%, 2.4% to be precise at constant currency. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the legacy Quintile Encore business, which itself declined more than 50% year-over-year. Excluding Encore, the Commercial business would have grown 4%. Integrated Engagement Services as expected was slightly down. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of revenue growth and that was evenly split between R&D and Commercial Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, which is higher than our guidance range and about $10 million above the midpoint of the range. This bit was entirely driven by stronger operating performance. Let me provide some color on a few key wins in the quarter. Let's start with the real-world insights business. The real-world team won a $15 million deal for two neurology studies with the top five pharma clients. Our global data, advanced analytics and deep therapeutic expertise in neurology set us apart from the competition. The clients saw a huge benefit in using retrospective data to accelerate sight identification, patient recruitment for these prospective studies in both the U.S. and Europe. Another top five pharma clients signed a $12.5 million real-world deal based on our unique capability to link diagnostic data, prescription data and demographic data to support a Phase IV interventional diabetes study. Turning to our R&D Solutions business, we saw continued improvement in our as-contracted booking strength. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of more than $9.6 billion. I have never done this, but I'm going to go off script, guys, over here. I was just reading before the call started a few of the initial notes that some of the analysts wrote, and I still see that people are still trying to calculate quarterly book-to-bill numbers even though we tried to tell you before that it is not a meaningful indicator of how we are doing. But because those calculations are all over the place, I just want to tell you that if you do the math – and really it is three elementary computations based on the numbers we reported. If you do the math, it is just below your magic number of 1.2x book-to-bill, again on a contracted basis for the quarter. We've said over and over, we're not going to do it, but I can't help myself. It is actually an improving booking trend that we have observed over the quarter. And again, I'm departing from script, if you were to do the same math on an awarded basis and we don't have the numbers, because we don't report award anymore, we report contracts. On an award basis that a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been materially higher than that quote, unquote, magic number of 1.2x. Now, back to the screen, I know people are screaming at me here, but I couldn't help myself. We are actually very encouraged by the early demand we are seeing for our Next-Gen clinical development offerings. Last quarter, I told you we had one over $100 million of business with Next-Gen, since the merger closed. We now stand at more than $400 million of awards, not all of which has contracted, tied directly to the application of Next-Gen of clinical development within clinical trials. The pipe keeps strengthening and our team is currently engaging more than 80 Next-Gen projects. Recent example of such wins include, for a large pharma client, we competed against 14 other CROs, and we're selected for a preferred partnership based on our unique ability to improve study design, site ID, and patient recruitment globally. The clients cited specifically our Next-Gen offering as a clear differentiator. We had another very significant win with the top five pharma clients, European pharma clients, who had awarded virtually no full service clinical business to us over the past six years. This was a fixed price award for more than $120 million. In landing this win, a key differentiator was our ability to quickly validate internal historic site performance data with real-world insights. The study has now kicked off and from the get-go, we were able to demonstrate higher operational performance. The time from contract to first site selection visit was less than 30 days, an unusually rapid pace, and we are expecting to accelerate the clients plan timeline for last patient in by three months. On the commercial side, I'd like to highlight a very important alliance we announced with Salesforce.com. This deal will enable us to build solutions on a global technology platform that is best in class and that will help our clients take their products to market more efficiently and more effectively. This will eventually encompass the entire cycle from driving patient recruitment to managing client's clinical trials to taking drugs to market more effectively with agile multi-channel applications all built on a single platform. The initial focus of this alliance will be on multi-channel stakeholder engagements. We will leverage Salesforce's Marketing Cloud and Force.com to enhance our existing capabilities in CRM and multi-channel marketing. With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Ari. And good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% at constant currency and 1.6% reported on a combined company basis. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. As a reminder, this non-cash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the first quarter. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first quarter revenue grew 3.1% at constant currency and 2% reported. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3% at actual FX rates. As Ari mentioned, when adjusting for the early clinical development business, where we closed the facility in London last year, R&D growth at constant currency was 5.5%. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.3% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a significant decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Excluding, Encore, constant currency Commercial Solutions growth was 4%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue declined 0.2% at constant FX and 0.9% reported. Turning now to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $467 million. As Ari mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA performance was better than the guidance we provided last quarter due to strong operating performance. GAAP net income was $74 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.31. Adjusted net income was $238 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was about 29% in the first quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower, and in the first quarter was approximately 10%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in the first quarter. The $1.3 billion of shares that we repurchased during the quarter had no impact to first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. A strong EPS performance was primarily a result of the operational performance I just mentioned along with slightly more than a $0.01 benefit from tax. Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. As you will recall from the previous two quarters, our new business and backlog metrics are now reported on an as contracted LTM basis. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.08 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.66 billion. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. Now, as Ari mentioned, contracted bookings have continued to improve and we are very pleased with this trend. I do want to also remind you that this is a long cycle business as Ari mentioned and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow, this is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill on a given quarter. Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $862 million and debt was about $8.4 billion, resulting in net debt of about $7.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.8 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $56 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million, and free cash flow was negative $22 million. As is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, both operating and free cash flow were impacted by cash outflows in our loyalty program businesses. These Commercial Solutions businesses managed co-pay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Our customers prefund these reimbursements, and we include this cash on our balance sheet. We've drawn this cash to pay pharmacies, as consumers use the programs. The inflows and outflows should even out over time, but in any given quarter can cause meaningful fluctuations in reported cash flow. You saw that we issued €1.425 billion of senior notes due in 2025. We also refinanced our term B debt and extended its maturity to 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares from two of our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder. In addition, we repurchased $550 million of shares in the open market for total share repurchases of $1.3 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this did not have any impact to adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter. We now have $231 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Now, this guidance is exactly the same as last quarter, nothing has changed. However, we did buy back $1.3 billion of our stock. We had originally planned on completing $500 million, so the additional $800 million was not in our original guidance. The additional $800 million of repurchases provides a benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS. Separately, we also took on additional debt that increases our interest expense and has a negative impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS. The net of these two items has a net benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS of $0.04. As a result, we feel comfortable raising our EPS guidance by $0.05. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.60. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year and adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now, remember the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As always, we would like to tell you what we see for the second quarter of 2017. At this point, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.93 billion and $1.97 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $470 million and $490 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.02 and $1.07. In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered strong operational and financial performance. Our Next-Gen clinical development offering continues to see success in the market. We had encouraging wins with our combined real-world insights offering. We had steady performance in our Commercial Solutions business. We are enhancing our existing capabilities in CRM and multi-channel marketing and announced an alliance with Salesforce.com. We closed the bond offering for €1.425 billion and extended our term loan B maturity until 2024. We repurchased a total of $1.3 billion of our stock, and we reaffirmed revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raised full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05. With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Mike, a quick question on the Commercial Solutions growth rate. I think you called out 4% constant currency, excluding Encore business. Did you have any contribution there from acquired businesses in the quarter? And I guess the same question also in the R&D Solutions.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Overall, the contribution from acquisitions was about 1%, and that's consistent across both Commercial and R&D Solutions in total company.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then the other one is on the pacing of your guidance, recognizing that the full year guidance really didn't fundamentally change much, did the pacing through the year change relative to your initial expectations? I think certainly the Street had over modeled the Q2 a little bit, but did anything change relative to your own initial expectations?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: No. No change. We expected – last quarter continue to expect the same cyclicality that we talked about, heavier in the backend of the year and very consistent with how we've seen it all along.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. And Ari, I appreciate the additional details on the quarterly booking trends. I know you guys are trying to get away from that metric. But I guess just trying to float a few things on our end, I know the bookings for the 12 months ended March did see a sequential downtick from the 12 months ended December, and not knowing the quarterly bookings, I'm sure there could be some noise in there. And yeah, you did highlight that the backlog grew quite nicely, sequentially in the quarter. So, maybe could you just talk about what you saw on a gross wins perspective and maybe a cancel's perspective in the quarter, just so we can understand a little bit better...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean...
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...what is driving the backlog growth?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric, because it really – I mean I could go on and on giving you examples that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The reason to address the first part of your commentary and question, the reason why the LTM is lower at the end of March than it was at the end of December is, because first Q 2016 dropped out of the LTM and happens to be that first Q 2016 was a very high number on a contracted basis. And so therefore, when you take it out of the 12 months, it's lower than the LTM at the end of December. Now, if you recall, that's going to really demonstrate why it's wrong to focus on the quarter and it's also wrong to focus on awarded and it's better to do it the way we suggest we do it now. And I just told you the number on a contracted basis for the first quarter last year was very high. And yet, the reported quarterly book-to-bill number last year when Quintiles was still a standalone company was on an awarded basis and was 0.95x, was under 1x, whereas the contracted number was materially over 1x. And the reason why it was materially over 1x is because – again because they manage the business based on quarterly awards. They could be contracting in the first quarter of 2016, stuff that has been awarded the year before because nobody was focusing on it. What we're trying to do here is compress the timeline between award and contract, only count that which is contracted for, change operationally internally so we can compensate Salesforce, et cetera, based on contracted work not just it is awarded to you and smooth the level of cancellations and things we have to take out of the backlog because they were never meant to be in, in the first place. So, again, I'm sorry for giving you the commentary, but that is the explanation for the LTM. With respect to the trend, our bookings are actually greater. It is a simple computation as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. You just do a subtraction of what the reported backlog is at the end of each quarter. You add that to the revenue reported in the quarter, that's an addition because that's the revenue was converted from the beginning of period backlog and you divide by the revenue. And if you do that, you'll see that you don't have the exact precise numbers, because last quarter we said it was about 9.5%, was slightly under that, but basically you went with a contracted book-to-bill for the quarter of just under 1.2x. Now again, don't focus on it, it could have been 1.1x or 1.3x, let's not – we have LTM of 1.16x which we feel is very good, and the trends will continue to improve based on the pipeline that we see and the awards that we generated in the quarter.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's actually usually helpful, and I think that based on that explanation, the LTM number is kind of useless then – it's really more the backlog number that everyone should be focused on...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Exactly.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...based on that explanation.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I guess just a follow-up, Ari, move over to something more strategic. The 1Q awards from the Next-Gen clinical offering, you mentioned was about $400 million. I was wondering if you could share anymore details around, maybe what types of clients or trials those were. Were these new clients to Quintiles, or people that had done some work with Quintiles in the past? Just trying to understand how you're making progress on the Next-Gen clinical side?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Several cases of new clients or – again, nobody is new with Quintiles we've done business with everybody in the world. But I mentioned I particularly highlighted the largest such award, because it kind of indicates to you what we're trying to do to change the model. This was with the top five European clients with whom frankly we hadn't done very much. I think the biggest award of the full clinical service was like in the $10 million range, again over the past six years, which we've looked at. We've done other work for these clients in other areas or specific work data or stats or CSO work, but not full service core clinical work. So this is the first time, and this is a very, very significant client, with whom our penetration on core clinical was very low to steadily (26:07). And that – so that's, I think, clear indication that there is something different. And the main reason we've been able to do that is that, we've demonstrated a new approach and new capabilities, which actually as I reported in my introductory comments, we already demonstrated, a product is already ongoing. It took 30 days from the signature of the contract to the first sight identity, which is really very, very small period, and we've been able to demonstrate that to the client. Another element that's unique about it is that we were so confident and we had a good view of risk and we were able and willing to go with a fixed price model. Again, that's something that's new and different, and that's enabled by Next-Gen. That's a powerful example that I mentioned because it's large, but there are many others, smaller size. This particular one is contracted for, and as I said, we are working on it already. But in aggregate, since the merger, we've been awarded over $400 million, which we know having won directly because of Next-Gen. I would also point out that in a few instances, we actually were able to go back and win stuff that has been awarded to somebody else, and go back with a different approach using Next-Gen.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks for all the comments.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: My pleasure.
Operator: And our next question comes from the Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Ari, good morning. So I appreciate the answer there to Bob's question on the backlog or bookings roll-forward and understand your point about kind of focusing on awards before and bringing contracts to signature kind of not been a focus. If we do take a six-month view, your roll-forward is down from $4.4 billion to $4.08 billion. I mean, are we still able to say the same thing that you're seeing momentum even though it's down, say, $320 million over a six-month period?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: I'm not sure, I've followed your question. And I'm...
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: I guess what I'm saying is, if the lag from award to book – award to contract signature is three months or six months, the dynamic where we're seeing...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Over a year or a year and a half.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Is this that long? Well, if it's that long then maybe it's a moot point. But...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Right.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: ...I guess we're seeing this tick-down of your trailing 12-month bookings number happened, not just one quarter, but two quarters in a row. And I'm wondering if the kind of all the contract signatures landing in the first quarter of last year, making it a big quarter
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think...
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: If that influenced both of the quarters.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think the number you're looking at is simply – again, the first quarter of 2016 was a huge, huge contract – on a contracted basis, a huge number. For whatever reason, a lot of it was of the prior, I don't know year and a half, four to six quarters. So going back to 2014 and 2015, they were signed and contracted for in the first quarter of 2016. Now, nobody was tracking contracted book-to-bill or contracted backlog in the way you're paying attention to it. Happens to be it's a huge number. And so when you pick it out of any LTM, you are going to have – by definition, okay, because it's going to bias the numbers. It's going to look like it's going down. But the amount of bookings that we are contracting quarter-after-quarter, over the past three quarters has been on a steady uptick.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. I'll leave that alone. So, as I think forward getting to kind of Tim's question about the cadence of the year, your uptick, I guess your trajectory as you move into the second half of 2017 starts to steepen, how do we think about a forward 12 months coverage number of like $2.9 billion, relatively constant as the forward forecast needs to accelerate? How do you fill in the remainder?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I would say a couple of things. It's Mike speaking, Dave. I think as Next-Gen really starts to take hold as we've said before we're confident in our ability to start to accelerate the burn a bit. It is fair that the $2.9 billion has been constant. We'll look to grow that over time. And I guess I would just point to the size of the backlog and the fact that when you look at the revenue guidance, you've got 79% or so, that's in your contracted backlog. And so, when you look at the piece that you need to fill in, it's a great visibility business and it's a very manageable amount to actually fill in and we've got good success doing it for a long time.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean just – look these are fair observations. With respect to the second quarter, it looks a little lumpy and not linear as perhaps had been modeled by the Street. I think the main reasons if you really want to focus on the second quarter, we have to speak about the first quarter, but first there is an FX impact, okay. Currency hasn't really changed much, since we last provided guidance, it's basically no impact. I mean we lost over a point of growth in the first quarter due to FX year-over-year, but not since we last gave guidance. So FX from the last year's second quarter has an impact. Secondly, there is the IES segment which is very lumpy. Q2 last year for IES, I think it was disclosed – I'm just looking at my colleagues here, it was disclosed last year. There was a one-time benefit of – if I recall, it was almost $10 million, it was a one-time royalty payment that was in IES, I think...
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Correct.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: ...last year second quarter, is that correct?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: And so, that again affects the compares year-over-year for the second quarter. Third, this Encore business which I remember when it was purchased a couple of years ago was like about $100 million of revenue and I mean the business is – we are trying to do something about it, but it is expected to continue to provide headwind And then again, back to the awards discussion, the awards last year were weaker as you know, and so, that again, it takes at least a year for revenue from those awards to translate, so there is a little bit less. So I think it gives you a little bit more color on why the second quarter is maybe not as strong as you might have expected, why then is the second half and towards the end of the year was stronger, that's because the revenue synergies we talked about as the Next-Gen that we already now contracted for and is starting to produce revenue and some of the real world stuff that we are winning, all of that is expected to more than compensate for what would otherwise have not been – or would have been more in line with the second quarter. And also, it's not just IES, I mean I mentioned IES, but there is also the legacy or Encore for that matter. The other legacy commercial business from – what was the name of the – IHS was the name of the division, the commercial Quintiles. They have an advisory business there that's also not doing that great. So we're kind of working ourselves through all of that and that is basically why you see perhaps second quarter a little weaker, but we feel comfortable. Frankly, if we didn't see that, we would have changed the guidance on revenue but we have not, we feel very strongly because of the bookings because of what's in the pipeline and what we see coming. So despite all of that and FX and so on, we are comfortable maintaining – very comfortable maintaining the guidance for the year.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: So thank you for that. At the risk of taking another minute here, I – so the question I wanted to ask is more forward-looking and more relevant to Next-Gen CRO and that is that our recent research suggests that some pharma companies are bringing some business in-house. And in general, that just tells me that there is a level of, say, frustration or searching for alternative models, which actually makes Next-Gen CRO fairly timely. And I just wanted to get your sense of having talked to a bunch of clients, which I'm sure you have at this point and what level of...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: ...receptivity on that. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Dave, I think – thank you for that question. I've heard that from others. Nobody decides. I've run a lot of different companies, nobody said I'm going to in-source or I'm going to outsource. That is not an end in of itself. The reason for outsourcing or in-sourcings are based on what is the lowest cost solution at the best quality and spec deliverable type criteria that I can get. If I can perform the works internally at a lower cost more effectively and within better timeframes and so on, then I'll do it inside, if not, I'll outsource. So, it's not outsourcing, in-sourcing. So this is what's driving, what is true is that pharma, and especially large pharma, are looking for solutions that enable them to perform the work at a lower cost and more effectively. That is the primary driver of those in-sourcing, outsourcing decisions. To the degree that they can do the work – look if all your selling is buddies that are going to run around and visit sites and audit and fill checklists, yeah, maybe it could be that is cheaper in-house. I mean it's not much of a benefit. Right? Because why would you give may margin. If it's a cost plus business, I do agree. But that is not what our value proposition is. We are trying to transition the business model precisely to be data, analytics, expertise and technology driven. And that is exactly our strategy. We're repositioning the business, and we believe we are in a unique position to do that. We have not seen that. I mean, some of the large pharmas specifically rumors to be stopping the outsourcing and bringing more work inside, are precisely some of the ones with whom we've won.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. I would love it, if you could tell me who, but I know you can't. Thank you for the answer.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Dave. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. And Ari, I also appreciate you're going off script. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the new business wins, specifically at success at expanding the pool of awards with some of the smaller trial activity?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: With emerging biopharma and smaller trials, yes. I mean, again following up also on Dave's question, in terms of outsourcing, certainly. Smaller pharma and midsize biotech, it's very hard to do it in-house, so, it's a non-starter. And as you know, they represented at this point in time a growing part of the pipeline. And so, again, there's no in-sourcing there. Historically, emerging biotech has been rather reluctant to partner with larger CROs, because they require a high-tech solution, and we perhaps were not as effective in providing that solution. As you know, Richard Staub, who runs our R&D business, was – before he joined Quintiles three years ago, was the CEO of Novella, which was a small CRO that's precisely worked with many emerging biotech clients. He's brought this approach to Quintiles and developing a specific set of offerings and capabilities that are targeted to small biotech and we are making inroads and being more aggressive commercially and in terms of the offering with biotech. Again, EBP requires a different set of capabilities, more customization. That could mean for a company like Quintiles higher cost, if we were not developing a separate solution, but we are now running these separately, as two separate offerings, obviously leveraging the capabilities that we are able to offer more flexible and, therefore, more attractive commercially value propositions for smaller biotech and we're making significant inroads and, frankly, displacing some of the smaller guys who had been serving that market.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then just one on the model, I know the overall guidance for the year unchanged, except for EPS. Can you maybe just talk about some of the underlying segment revenue for the year? Do you feel better at one end of the range for the previous guidance that you gave for the segments?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There is no change there. Again, there could be fluctuations. We are a large company and even within those segments, there are a lot of moving parts. But generally, the guidance we provided earlier is the same. Okay, I think we provide the ranges for each segment and we feel comfortable within those segments.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go, ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. All right. Could you maybe just give us an update on where kind of the Next-Gen CRO rollout stands? Have you automated the various data streams? And when do you think you can sort of take this out broadly to clients?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: We are making very good progress as noted, we haven't been waiting for that to – for that full industrialization, if you will, to go to market, and we're making good progress. We said towards the later part of this year and that's still the schedule. But we are accelerating a little bit. Frankly, we are spending a little bit more than we thought in ramping up the capabilities. We are hiring more people. We've built a dedicated Analytics Center of Excellence that is quickly ramping up with data scientists and epidemiologists, et cetera, to do this – to continue to take this across therapies. And I think we're making very good progress.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. And then, maybe turning back to the legacy IMS business, you used to talk about, how your kind of traditional data business is doing versus the technology services business. Any update there that you can provide? And is the merger impacting that, that legacy IMS business at all one way or another?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we don't segment the business like this anymore, because we've re-organized our business internally and so on. But essentially, the LTMs in many cases, the business like in the technology services side or specifically in real-world evidence, we've merged the businesses, so it's hard even now to look at what is the growth of the legacy IMS real-world business versus the growth of the Quintiles legacy real-world business. But based on what we see, to give you an example, it's very similar to what you've seen before, okay. Again, the engine for (44:13) business traditionally is a flat business, very low single-digits. And the – what we used to called Technology Services business was low double-digits. And essentially, we've seen the same thing minus the drag of the less performing – the lower performance inherited Quintiles businesses mainly the Advisory business, Encore and also to a degree, like for example, I know specifically that the real-world business, which of IMS had been growing in the mid-teens is still growing in the teens, but lower mid-teens and I know because I specifically look at that and had a specific review on it. And the reason for that is that the Quintiles legacy real-world business was growing at a lower rate. So, we're confident we're going to – once we integrate and then so on, we're going to continue to accelerate that growth, but it did reduce our growth rates in the – what we used to call Tech Services business somewhat.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. So I'm just sort of curious on some of the moving parts in the model, so both the legacy Quintiles and the legacy IMS businesses were sort of low 20%s SG&A, company's SG&A has sort of spiked. Can you sort of give us an update on the cost synergy targets and what's going on in terms of that and I guess why we're sort of seeing the spike relative to the historicals on the SG&A?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Derik, it's Mike. The most important takeaway here is that we remain very confident in the synergy targets that we talked about, back when we announced the merger and we obviously increased the cost synergy target from $100 million to $200 million exiting 2019. We still feel very comfortable with that and we continue to track towards that very well. We are making investments in the business overall. And I think that when you look at our performance and our margins, we're actually seeing a little bit of an uptick in our R&D business and Commercial. We're making some investments there. We have the Salesforce.com platform that's very important. We're spending some money there and investing. But overall, we're on a good trajectory and we feel like the synergies are coming together very nicely.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And I guess, can you sort of give us just some basic inputs for the model like D&A for the year, depreciation and amortization for the year? Net expense or (47:15) what's embedded into your guide?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, the D&A is – our capital intensity is as you know is very low. It came in at exactly 4% for the quarter which is in line with the intensity we see. It was kind of 5% to 6% legacy I and 1% or 2% legacy Q, comes together about 4%. D&A, I think for the next few years is probably about $1 billion a year, but the important takeaway there is that the majority of that relates to purchase price amortization, and we don't include that obviously and it would be adjusted.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Next up the operational depreciation is very modest, it's about $50 million per quarter that is. So, that's the operational fees, continues to be not at all a capital intensive business, and that's how we see it, as it relates to the EPS which is I think is part of your question.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Yeah. And I guess just one thing going back to like the operating margin numbers and sort of thinking about that, it's like when you sort of look at that, say you go through a period of investment this year, and you'll get the cost synergies, it's like what can we sort of think about for annual op margin expansion opportunities sort of beyond 2017?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, as you know, we've said that it's always good to manage revenue and costs at the same time. So, we are counting on margin expansion year-over-year. Obviously, when you have a merger like this, things tend to happen. You've got higher costs that are not necessarily adjustable that relate to achieving the synergies in the first year and that's what's happening this year. We have costs associated sometimes we have to keep two systems running at the same time before we can shut that one down, et cetera. And that kind of can last a year or so. There are some merger-related costs that we have to carry especially in the first half of the year and that cannot be added back to our non-GAAP results. And the other element here that's – this year especially is that again we spoke a little bit earlier about our investments in the Next-Gen solution and we are making a lot of investments there in the data, technology, people to accelerate that development and that perhaps is a little bit more and we are accelerating that. On the Commercial Solutions side, we announced this deal with Salesforce.com, and we're very excited about that. And that obviously requires us to make some investments to transition the applications to the new platform over time. And that also is an investment we're making in the business for the long term. So, despite all of that we think our margin, reported margin, this quarter was basically flattish and the reason we are reporting that even though we are having all these extra costs and investments that I just talked about is because we continue to underline in the businesses, continue to do – improve our competiveness and cost position, plus we have the synergies that would be rolling later on, not yet, but certainly beginning in 2018 in a significant way. So, underlying the business, the cost reductions are continuing, but we also have added costs that I just described, which are reinvestments in the business. So despite all of that, our margins are okay. I think we should be much higher. I mean on the R&D side – also I mean you have – we noted that there's a mix issue, the IES business has very low margins and continues to be a drag obviously and some quarters could be a little bit higher. So, it has a negative impact on margin. So, again a lot of moving parts, but in aggregate, we try – we're going to be managing (51:48) margins in a way that will seek expansion. We believe that there is significant operational improvements that can be made within the R&D business. And we're actually seeing some of that already. And that kind of offsets some of the investments we're making in Next-Gen and others for now.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: And we have time for one more question, operator.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And our question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. Maybe following up on some of the commentary earlier on midcap biotech. As you push further into that market, obviously, we've been hearing some anecdotal data points from some of the peers on funding issues, reprioritization of pipelines and other dynamics. Are you starting to see any of these surface as you push more into this midcap biotech?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Not really. Are you talking about cancellations you mean or...?
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. I mean just talked about...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...private funding weakness, INCR had delays and other dynamics. Those and other issues. So, I'm just wondering (52:58)
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: No, not really. We haven't seen any, the answer is no. We've seen that, but that's not unusual, nothing unusual versus what the company had experienced historically, nothing unusual, no trend breaking events.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then, I guess as we think about backlog conversion, obviously trial complexity is not new, but how are you thinking about backlog conversion dynamics going forward? Do you see further elongation of conversion?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Again, I would look at this over a long time period. It's a little hard to look at it quarter-by-quarter and try to make – again, it is quarterly focused, I know it is what it is. Given the nature of the business, it's such a long-cycle business that burn rates can fluctuate because of a number of reasons. If you win a large multi-year study, then by definition the burn rate is going to go down. If you win more SSP work, relative to the rest, then the burn rate is going to go down, because depending on the length of the contract. If you have a very strong bookings quarter, again, it's going to cause the next quarter burn rate to go down. So that – it's hard to tell. Really ideally you should take a look at specific projects and specific trials, and see whether revenue associated with the trial is faster overall than it would have been otherwise. So it's hard to compare. It's such a complex business with so many moving parts. Some have a metric and can look good, and in fact, that not necessarily indicate goodness or metric can look bad, and it doesn't necessarily indicate badness. So if you ask us – if you ask me operationally, of course, we are focusing on accelerating revenue burn, and we want to do this through systematic changes in the way we do business. Again using more data, analytics and technology, less quarter-on-quarter trial and error experience based sight identification and patients targeting type of approach. And we believe that by doing that we will accelerate revenue burn for individual trials that are using Next-Gen. And I did mention some detail on recently one such project, where again we are able to accelerate timelines quite dramatically and obviously the associated revenue will come in faster.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just one last one on the commercial salesforce, IES was flat this quarter. It was down 8% last quarter. Is this signs of stabilization? In other words, are your reps starting to differentiate the offering by leveraging real-time IMS data?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: No. There is such a fluctuation and lumpiness in this business, it's hard to say that it has fairly stabilized. Look, it declined – if you go back, the business grew nicely in 2015 and then it declined a lot in 2016. Q1 was flattish I would say, and I think we expect that this year to be the same, flattish, maybe slightly negative, that's our expectation.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay . I think that's all we've got time for, we've just come up on the hour. So thank you for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you all again on our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Matt Pfister and I will be available after this call to take up any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the QuintilesIMS Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, February 14, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McDonnell, Execution Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our QuintilesIMS Investor Relations website at, ir.quintilesims.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-K filed on November 3, 2016, and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange. And therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. This is our first call reporting earnings for the combined company, and on this call, we will provide results for 2016 as well as guidance for 2017. The fourth quarter was very active for the QuintilesIMS team. We delivered on our financial commitments through solid operational discipline. Our integration teams continue to drive execution of their integration plans, implementing best practices and process efficiencies across the organization. Changes were made to our management structure as we look to fully leverage the talent across both legacy organizations, and specifically, we began to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure and implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level. We started the process of integrating data into our site identification and patient recruitment processes, and we are beginning to see great traction with clients. We also repurchased $1 billion of our stock during the quarter, and I'm pleased that our board of directors just approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a $1.5 billion remaining authorization. Let's review the financial results. Year-over-year comparisons are obviously impacted by the merger. We are making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis. That is, as if the merger took place January 1, 2015. Fourth quarter revenue was about $2 billion on a combined company basis. And adding back the merger-related deferred revenue adjustment we discussed last quarter, growth would have been 4.2% at constant foreign exchange rates. The legacy IMS business grew 6.9%. The new Commercial Solutions segment also includes legacy Quintiles Commercial businesses which declined year-over-year. And so, in aggregate, Commercial Solutions grew 4.9%. R&D Solutions growth was 6.6%, and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% during the quarter, and this is all at constant FX. Revenue growth on a reported basis was impacted by some headwind from unfavorable currency movements during the current quarter. In aggregate, we lost about $10 million of revenue to our guidance of three months ago due to adverse FX, nearly all of which was in our Commercial Solutions segment. All-in-all, we performed in line with our revenue guidance at constant currency in all three segments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, which was $34 million higher than our mid-point guidance three months ago. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 14.5%, again at constant currency and on a combined company basis. Fourth quarter combined company adjusted EBITDA margin was about 27% when you exclude the deferred revenue adjustment. We had strong margin expansion of about 300 basis points. And this was primarily driven by operational improvements and good margin expansion in the Commercial segment, mostly the legacy IMS Commercial business, as well as operational improvements in the R&D segment, and to a lesser degree, from favorable currency mix in the delivery costs of our CRO work. The Commercial Solutions segment continues to see success in the market. I'd like to give you some color and a few examples of a few recent wins. A top-five pharma client signed a global multi-year, multi-million dollar tech deal for our life science cloud-based Master Data Management, or MDM, app. The client already uses a number of our SaaS-based apps and will benefit from our integrated suite. In this case, the win was driven by our proven track record and expertise in the MDM space, combined with our global deployment and support capabilities. Another win, this time with a specialty pharma company who selected QuintilesIMS to be the single supplier supporting their entire commercial operations. This is a $16 million deal combined technology and services from our Commercial Solutions segment as well as sales rep deployment from our Integrated Engagement Services segment. The R&D Solutions business saw good progress as well with a turnaround of our booking trend, which I'll remind you, we now report on an as-contracted basis. We finished the year with about $9.5 billion in contracted backlog, and that is stated as at the end of year currency rates. And we have about $4.3 billion in LTM contracted net new business. You will recall that our integration teams are working hard to drive a productionized data-enriched R&D offering, which we expect to take to clients in the second half of 2017. We have a large full-time team working to integrate the legacy IMS data with the CRO business. But we are not waiting, we already engaged with over 30 clients on opportunities to leverage this next-generation of clinical development offering. In fact, we had already over $100 million worth of awards in the quarter for this next-gen clinical development, and we are working over $1 billion worth of opportunities, where data enabled site ID and patient recruitment can be leveraged. For example, in a recent such win, which was for an ophthalmology trial, we were able to use our data assets, predictive analytics capabilities and expertise with biosimilar development to identify the right sites with both the appropriate patient density levels and the required investigator therapeutic expertise, in this case, intraocular injections. In the traditional approach, 3,000 potential sites will have normally been identified as having the relevant patients that would qualify for the trial. However, using our data and analytics, we were able to target and pinpoint the 261 most optimal sites from the get-go. The use of the IMS data saves considerable time and resources with the design of the trial, the identification of sites, and the targeting of eligible patient populations, ultimately helping clients deliver the product to market faster. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details. On a reported basis, the year-over-year numbers are not meaningful as this is our first quarter as a combined company, and IMS results are not included in prior periods. I will not read them out, but they are in the tables and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. I would like to call to your attention the more meaningful comparisons in the center of the page. Fourth quarter revenue was just over $2 billion, an increase of 4.2% at constant currency and 3.5% reported on a combined company basis, and adding back deferred revenue. You'll recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call, this non-cash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined-company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue improved 4.9% at constant currency and 4.2% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was dampened by a decline in the Quintiles legacy Commercial business of about $12 million. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 6.9% at constant currency and 6.1% at actual foreign currency. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 6.6% at constant currency and 5.4% at actual FX rates, and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% at constant FX, and 6.7% reported. Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million increasing 14.5% at constant FX and 16.7% of reported FX rates on a combined company basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins, when adjusting for deferred revenue, expanded about 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year on a combined company basis. As Ari mentioned, the strong margin expansion was primarily from operational improvements in the Commercial and R&D segments as well as to a lesser degree from a favorable currency mix in our R&D Solutions costs. Moving down to P&L, fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $178 million and GAAP loss per share was $0.74. The loss was primarily due to a one-time deferred tax charge from changing our assertion regarding most of our 2016 and prior foreign earnings, whereby we will no longer permanently reinvest those earnings overseas. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, deferred taxes were recorded on these earnings at the higher U.S. income tax rate. The total P&L charge, as a result of this change was $252 million. It is important to note that we intend to assert there are foreign earnings after 2016, will be indefinitely reinvested overseas. Therefore, we do expect to return to normal tax levels in 2017 and subsequent years. Adjusted net income was $266 million. You'll recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was 34% for the fourth quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower, and in the fourth quarter was only 4.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter, using the adjusted book tax rate. Now, let's turn to full year revenue. For the full year, once again, the reported numbers are not comparable as this is the first quarter we're reporting results as a combined company. I will not go into detail on these numbers during the call, but as I mentioned previously, they're in the table and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. Full year revenue increased 7.8% at constant currency and 7.4% reported on a combined basis and adjusting for deferred revenue. For our segments, and on the same basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 9.1% at constant currency, 8.5% reported. The Commercial Solutions' full year growth rate was also impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles Commercial business. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 11.3% at constant currency and 10.5% at actual FX. R&D Solutions grew 10.6% at constant FX rates, 9.9% reported, and Integrated Engagement Services declined 7.9% at constant currency, 5.8% at actual FX rates. Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. You will recall that last year, we began reporting our net new business and backlog metrics on an as contracted basis, meaning that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or an executed contract. We believe this is a more conservative practice and precise approach compared to the traditional industry practice. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, R&D Solutions bookings were about $4.3 billion resulting in an ending contracted backlog of approximately $9.5 billion. This end-of-year backlog is stated at end-of-year exchange rates and the number therefore includes an adverse FX impact. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. Now, contracted bookings were stronger this quarter than last quarter and we are pleased with this development. I do want to remind you, this is a long-cycle business and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow, this is why you should focused on overall backlog and LTM metrics, rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.956 billion, an increase of 9.1% at constant FX and 12.6% reported on a combined company basis. Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion and debt was $7.2 billion resulting in net debt of $6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 3.7 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, or leverage ratio was 3.1 times. Cash flow from operating activities was $447 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $86 million, and free cash flow was $361 million for the fourth quarter. A quick update on share repurchase. You'll recall that on our last call, we announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases are preferred method of returning capital to shareholders and we also see our shares as an attractive investment. As a result, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock representing almost 13 million shares, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. As already mentioned, our board has also approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with the remaining authorization of $1.5 billion. Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss foreign currency. As you're aware, and as depicted on the chart, following the end of the third quarter and U.S. election results, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly, especially against the Japanese yen, euro and the British pound. As a result, this impacts our full year 2017 guidance at actual FX rates, which assumes rates remain unchanged through the end of 2017. To help you best understand the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, I'll provide you with a rule of thumb for a hypothetical scenario, where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of securities. Of course, we do business in over 60 currencies, and not all will move in the same direction, by the same amount, at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of providing this rule of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move, but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movements. Based on our current mix of currency, if the dollar changes 1% versus our basket of currencies, there would be a about $30 million impact on full year revenue. The euro would account for about $14 million of this full year revenue impact, again would account for approximately $6 million, and all other currencies combined would account for approximately $10 million. Now, we will attempt to mitigate the foreign currency impact on adjusted EBITDA after cost reductions and the potential to leverage favorable currency mix based upon, where we perform R&D work. You should also note that our euro-denominated interest expense provide a natural hedge that reduces the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on adjusted diluted EPS by about a third. Now, let's turn to guidance. Our revenue outlook for 2017, assuming FX rates held constant in 2017 versus 2016, will be $8.125 billion to $8.225 billion. The difference between where rates are today and where they were on average for 2016, results in a foreign currency headwind of approximately $125 million. Therefore, our full year 2017 revenue guidance is $8 billion to $8.1 billion, assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.655 billion and $3.69 billion. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to between $745 million and $760 million. Similar to last quarter, this guidance again includes an estimate for deferred revenue, which is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment revenue and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. And adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.55. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year, adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%, and GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. Now, remember the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As discussed on our last call, we will also provide quarterly guidance going forward. As you know, for legacy Quintiles and legacy IMS, the first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters, so you should not expect a linear progression throughout the year. For the first quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.89 billion and $1.925 billion. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $850 million and $865 million. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $855 million and $870 million. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $185 million and $190 million. This revenue guidance includes the expected $7 million deferred revenue adjustment, I just mentioned. For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $450 million and $465 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.93 and $0.97. In summary, we had a strong quarter. We delivered solid operational and financial performance. Operational integration is moving forward as expected. We saw an uptick in our R&D booking trends. The early client success we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development is encouraging. We repurchased $1 billion of our stock under the existing $1.5 billion authorization, and our board approved an increase to this authorization by another $1 billion to a total of $2.5 billion. And we look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2017. With that, I would ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks, and good morning. I wanted to ask about the new authorizations in the quarter. It look like the trailing 12 months data was pretty solid at 124 (24:55), and I think you mentioned in the fourth quarter you saw an uptick. Is there any other data you can give just to give us a little bit more visibility on how the integration is affecting those numbers? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, thank you for the question. Look, we've cautioned you in the past not to focus too much on quarterly bookings. Once again, this is a long-cycle business, and we ought to focus on at least the last 12 months booking trends. Now, we did mentioned in the Q3 earnings release call that bookings has been weak in the last quarter of Quintiles standalone existence. And frankly, there had been ups and downs in the prior 12 months period. So, we were pleased to see that kind of weaker trend reverse in the fourth quarter. And in aggregate, again for the last 12 months, we had strong bookings again on a contracted basis, which is what we want to focus people on. The data I did mentioned in my introductory remarks that we actually won over $100 million of awards which we believe can be traced to the leveraging of the data, and I gave an example of how that helped us. We have a large pipeline of opportunities where we are already leveraging the data even though, as I mentioned, we not yet fully productionized, and we expect to be productionized in the second half of this year. Thank you.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And I just wanted to follow-up on that point, Ari, in terms of automating the process. Could you just talk a little bit more about the systems build-out and what should we be expecting to see as you look to just integrate the process and make the data recruitment part of the package that you offer? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, so again, you bring (27:16) systems, there is a lot of technology, specifically data mining tools and the way our databases are constructed. So, there is a lot of work by our data scientists that is being done at the moment focusing on the top most significant 15 therapeutic categories, so that's going well, and we have a large full time team, with again data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and clinicians working on this. We're also leveraging our one key asset, which is over 15 million healthcare professionals around the world, a massive database, which again traditionally and historically have been used by IMS to support Commercial activities and we are redirecting this significant data asset to be used in clinical trials, and in site identification, and the ability to convert some of those physicians into investigators for specific trials. So a lot of work is being done, and again, how we expect to see this happening in our Commercial activities is, we obviously want a high win rate, that's what we're targeting, and we are trying to, as we mentioned earlier, unlock large accounts that have been previously not significant clients of the legacy Quintiles R&D business. We're also, frankly, looking at the burn rate. I'm sure you've observed that the industry generally is experiencing slower burn of their backlog, and that is due to the increased complexity of the trials and of the highly specialized nature of the drugs that are being developed and in our (29:26) patient population and the difficulty to enroll those patients. So, all of that leads to lower burn rate of the backlog. It's not so for us. We've thankfully not experienced that, and we believe it's because we're leveraging the data, and the fact also that we now look at our backlog and our bookings on a contracted basis is much more precise, and therefore, we should see for both reasons the fact that we have a more precise backlog, more correct backlog, more accurate, and the fact that we leveraging our data should lead to a backlog conversion that's improving over time.
Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Ari.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, thank you. Mike, would you be willing to tell us how much acquired revenue in the last 12 months contributed to the growth in the Commercial segment and the R&D segment?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's something that we typically – we obviously had a transformational transaction between Quintiles and IMS, but as far as the tuck-in strategy that IMS has utilized very successfully for extended period of time, we typically don't break that out in great detail. I think that, overall, when you look at the rate of growth, I think the important highlight is that on a constant currency basis the business grew 6.9%, which is right in line with what we said before.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I can...
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: ...supplement that. No, we've historically on the IMS side guided to a couple of points of our growth being from those tuck-in acquisitions, and the same is true for 2016.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: And on the Quintiles side, on the R&D side very, very little, right. I mean, after you accounted for the Q2, the Q square merger, you had half of the year was earlier in the year. But other than that, it's basically in the rounding.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Just curious, did you guys do a number of small tuck-in acquisitions in Q4 that maybe didn't rise to the level of a press release?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: No. Not that I'm aware.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Nothing material, no.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: No.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Tim.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to touch on the combined sales force. In the past, you guys have discussed, working fine together, in the prepared remarks there were some examples cited. But, could you just comment on where you are in terms of how the sales force is evolving as a combined entity, and when you expect the new and improved combined sales force to really start to gel, just to get a sense of how long that takes?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Well, historically, the R&D segment, the legacy Quintiles organization has a highly centralized account management and sales management activity. We have decided to leverage both the existing centralized account management and sales force of Quintiles as well as the historically decentralized and close to the customer approach that IMS has utilized. So, we've reorganized our company to have one of the hybrid approach. Account management obviously for probably the top 50 clients has to be one account management approach. And frankly, even if we didn't want to, our clients themselves have approached us. We have – most of the large clients have approached us to – we have now become one of the most significant providers to them and across a suite of our offerings from R&D to Commercial and we welcome those conversations. We have actually an account management team under Paul Spreen, who works on what we call total cost of ownership, and makes the rather compelling case to our clients that if they work with us, soup to nuts, it brings a lot of advantages. We have the scale, the level of innovation, the investments that enabled them to get best-in-class offerings across the board, and certainly at compelling cost levels. So, we're having those conversations, and for those obviously, there has to be a unified account management approach.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, has that sort of – has all those leaders been identified, those team leaders? And I guess, just trying to get a sense of when it sort of would start to gel in the marketplace?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, in some cases, yes. In some cases, we're still transitioning. Again, this case is where we have two very, very good account leads on both legacy organizations and for now they are working together as we are reallocating and there are clients that, frankly, that neither organization had dedicated a full-time account management team, because they were not large enough for either of us. But in the present situation they have become, when we pull together the two accounts, the two legacy accounts. So, in those cases, we are still putting together an account management team because neither of the organization had one.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: So it's transitioning. I believe that by the middle of the year again everything will be in place. But, we've made very, very good progress.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, as I think about some of your larger peers, it feels like there is a little bit of disarray among several for varying reasons. And I guess if you think about the integration of IMS with the CRO business kind of – if the smarter CRO, if you will. And traction you're getting there from the standpoint of a win rate perspective, I'm assuming win rate probably ticked up in the fourth quarter. And then, in addition to that, just kind of what's going on whether it'd be a sales process for one of your competitors, another competitor, obviously, kind of dealing with their own skeletons. Well, how do you fickle about Ari and the team, kind of your win rate as we think about 2017 specifically on the CRO business. But also, if you'd like to talk about just the legacy IMS business, that would be great too?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks Greg, for your question. Look, we stated many times we're very excited about this combination. We're going about it in a very methodical and rigorous manner. We're not going to be distracted by what's happening around us. And every competitor, whether it's on the Commercial side, or on the R&D side, have their own issues. We're focusing intensely on our merger integration and on developing what we believe are compelling solutions to resolve some of the most critical issues in healthcare. We believe that transitioning to more data-intensive, more process-focused type of approaches to clinical trial, more technology enablement is the right way to go. Be less dependent on human error and paper processing, and that's our general vision here for the merger, and we find very receptive ears among our clients. Obviously, it's a long-cycle of business on the clinical trials side, owing to a win rate. For smaller trials, we are able to see already better trend. It's hard to have enough numbers to call it a firm trend. And as I said before, this is a long-cycle business. So, not to get too excited about the good news in a quarter, nor to be too depressed about not so good news in another quarter. Let's look at least at the 12 months. This is a long-term business – long-cycle business and we're here for the long-term. But, certainly what we've seen so far is very encouraging, and for smaller trials, we definitely know that we're winning, because we have these data, and because we'll be able to demonstrate a different approach to the clients. In fact, in a couple of cases, we've sort of recovered from what at least the organization has believed was a loss, but we reintroduced the new approach and we're able to, safe today, so to speak. So, we know it works. It's very compelling. And we have bright eyes around the table when we demo what the data can do.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: That's great. And looking forward to watching that win rate tick up over time, I'm sure. Thanks so much.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Yeah, I'd just a couple around the cadence. I guess, first on the guide on R&D Solutions for 1Q, it looks like you guys are calling for revenue about 3%, full year 6%. Just wanted to get a better sense of that implied ramp. I know the comps get easier, but do you have a line of sight into specific projects that will drive that acceleration throughout the year? And then, just off the topic of the next generation clinical development offering, I'm curious how much of the implied ramp is coming from that new offering as well?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start, it's Mike. I think on the implied ramp and so forth, it continues to be – it's a great backlog business. I think that the fact that we now only included in backlog what's under contract gives us good visibility, good line of sight, and we did talk about seasonality in the results. And I think that if you look at legacy Q, not quite a seasonal on the top line as maybe legacy IMS. And so, I think that the way we've staged the guidance, it feel like we've got good visibility when you look at what's in our backlog and we progress throughout the year.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then I guess just one on the overall EBITDA cadence as well. I know, you mentioned seasonality, but it does seem like a little bit more than usual looking at the businesses independently of a drop-off in 1Q from 4Q based on the guidance. Just curious if there is anything worth calling out beyond the normal seasonality that might help explain the drop off from this quarter to next quarter?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I might just – for those less familiar with the IMS business, generally the first quarter is slower. You know, budgets tend to still be firmed up among our clients. There usually is a rush in the fourth quarter to get things approved internally, and then therefore stock is deferred. We also have a significant portion of the IMS legacy business that is subscription-based, and so, this is a renewal season, so to speak. And so a lot of the contracts are still being renewed. So, all of that has an impact. But with respect to EBITDA, and specifically this year, we have in addition, the integration going on. So, a lot of restructuring driven by the merger, a lot of reorganization and project costs that are included there, and therefore, there is a ramp before you start seeing some of the benefit and the project costs going down towards the back-end of the year, so that's perhaps maybe what accentuates the trend this year.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thanks, Ari.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. Ari, can you talk a little bit more about the drivers of softness in Integrated Engagement Services down 8%, where do you see that bottoming out, and what do you think on timelines for recovery?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Tycho. I think, look, this is a business that's – that – it comes in big chunks. Right? It's very lumpy. It's a business that has very little deal flow; normally (43:39) this is not like we are looking at a big pipeline. These are one-off deals. You can have a year where you do extremely well. And then, like I think the case – that was the case in 2015, where the business grew nicely. And then you have a year like 2016 where the business wasn't growing. For 2017, we're not seeing any major ups or downs, we see more stability hopefully, and it ebbs and flows with the needs of pharma, and our clients have decided they want to internalize and some others decided they want to outsource. So, it's hard to predict this business. It's not – none of us likes unpredictability, but look, it's a single-digit EBITDA business, hard to see; I'm in the margin expansion business, I've been all my career. And so, look at this business, and I keep – I'm struggling with how do you actually grow profits in this business, and it's very hard to do that. We are going to put in place some actions to improve it, we're trying to also data enable it by the way. We're trying to make it more differentiated. Equip our CSO sales force with technology and so on. But, boy, it's not an easily margin expansion story. And even if you do everything right, it will be maybe a point or two better on margins. I don't see this as a big grower top line, and I don't see it as a big contributor profit wise. Again, it requires no capital investments, it's there. And I cited an example in my introductory remarks of a case where a smaller specialty pharma company basically outsourced their entire commercial activities with us, including the sales force. So, here it's for the first time we sold the full package. The full suite of data and services from the IMS legacy business and technology, CRM, et cetera, plus the IES (46:02) capabilities. So, I think in some cases – and we have more and more demand for such kind of bundled services when a company considers outsourcing their entire commercial operations, sometimes even we're having a dialogue with larger pharma in specific geographies, Central Europe, Latin America, where they really don't have the scale to make this a profitable business. So, it can be helpful with the rest of our business.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then, similarly CSO within Commercial, that was down mid-teens. Do you have a view on when that could start to improve?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's tied primarily or in part to the Encore business. We talked about that previously and booked an impairment charge on that in the third quarter. And it's just a business that hasn't been performing to expectations. So, it's very small in the scheme of the combined company. It's not material. But, as you look at it in isolation of the Commercial business, it's a little bit more of an impact which is why we called it out separately.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just one last one, are you able to give us an organic growth number for legacy IMS in the quarter?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I answered the question earlier. I think I said it's similar to prior quarters, and that is, again when you're factoring – I don't know if you recall, we had made a large acquisition called Cegedim, and that's now largely out of the numbers. They have the (47:34) legacy CRM business that's essentially dying product line and when you factor that in the drag was about a point, and if you adjust for that drag, the legacy IMS organic growth was same as usual at 4%.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So, when we look at guidance for 2017, it seems that about a third of the EPS growth, however, a little bit more than that is coming from buyback. So, can you just walk us through the cadence of the buybacks of about $1.5 million remaining of authorization. How should we think about the timing first half versus second half?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Ricky, just to clarify your question, you mentioned that – you said the share buyback accounts for a third, is that what you said? I misunderstood it.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: For 2017, just when you think about the EPS year-over-year growth?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Right. So, well, I mean you have to offset the balance sheet of the share buyback with the cost, right, because the financing cost is significant. If you – we use the $1 billion of cash which could at least theoretically be used to reduce the debt, plus we used our revolver, we repatriated cash from overseas, that's how we financed that $1 billion of repurchase. And it was done largely towards the – within a few weeks after the November authorization, and obviously, we stopped doing that before the end of the year. So, I think in aggregate, it's more like in the (49:31).
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, when you look at 2017 exactly, you have to realize that we have $1 billion more borrowings than we otherwise would for buying those shares back. So, when you factor that in, it's much less impactful in 2017. Obviously, as earnings grow in future years, it becomes more, but...
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Right. For future it's certainly very accretive. And that's what we did it, and we think that the shares are very attractive investments where they sit today. With respect to the $1.5 billion additional remaining authorization, we are looking at several scenarios now on how to execute that. And in the normal course of events, we could simply continue to repurchase in the market. We also have large sponsors still. You know investors complain to us when we meet with them. But, what they call the hangover, and so that over time, obviously that should disappear. And so we might take advantage of this repurchase to reduce that hangover as well. But again, we're committed certainly by the end of the year to do the balance of the $1.5 billion. So, another $500 million, and obviously, the earlier we can do, we can execute these repurchase, the better.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then one follow-up in response to one of the questions, Ari. You talked about the improving backlog conversion rate that you expect to see, as kind of like your data capabilities resonate more in the marketplace. So, how long will it take until we see kind of like these improved conversion rates? Are you seeing it already? Is this a factor in your 2017 guidance range, or is this something that we should think about as more mid to long-term benefit?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's always, as I said before, it's a long-cycle of business, so it's more mid-term benefit. But look, I think there are two things. One, we changed how we look at our backlog in terms of our – and we focus on contracted. Again, we believe that the traditional approach in the industry was not conservative enough, and a lot of awards there that may or may not – maybe should or shouldn't have been in the backlog, and as a result, you'll see conversion that's much slower, that maybe one of the explanations of what the industry is experiencing in lower burn rate. The second one is, again, as I said before that the trials are more and more complex, and this is more difficult to find the right patients and to enroll them, and therefore revenue burns at a slower rate. Now, because we have converted to contracted basis backlog measurement, we believe that we won't have that first issue, or less of it, and because we're using data to identify the optimal sites, we believe we will accelerate rather than delay backlog conversion, and therefore, we mitigate those trends; in fact, if you look at our burn rate, our burn rate, it's essentially flat to better, and our fourth quarter burn rate was actually better. We do believe that it's the result of those two differences versus the rest of the industry. And we expect the burn rate to accelerate all the time.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just, will you provide in your filing the margins per segment?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: I think, what is the...
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There will be information on segments that will in our 10-K and we'll have some segment profit information. It won't necessarily be at the adjusted EBITDA level, but there will be some helpful and useful margin information by segment.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Right. Although again, the compares are difficult because of allocations and merger.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Correct. Yeah.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Very good.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Ricky.
Andrew Markwick - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Matt Pfister and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the QuintilesIMS Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 2, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our QuintilesIMS third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning are Ari Bousbib, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Pike, our Chairman and President of Research & Development Solutions, and Former CEO of Quintiles; Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Former CFO of IMS Health; and Todd Kasper, Former Vice President of Investor Relations of Quintiles. During this call, we will provide Quintiles and IMS Health's standalone third quarter financial results, and QuintilesIMS combined company fourth quarter guidance. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you that are on the webcast. This presentation will be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our QuintilesIMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those statements or implied forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including Quintiles' and IMS Health's 2015 annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 11, 2016, and February 19, 2016, respectively, and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. Note that historic adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS are presented using the same legacy calculation each company previously used to calculate such financial measures. I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first ever QuintilesIMS earnings call to discuss the third quarter 2016 financial results of each legacy company. Before we review the numbers, let me provide a quick update on the merger. As you know, we successfully completed the merger of Quintiles and IMS Health on October 3, 2016. The combination of these two great companies creates a leading integrated information and technology-enabled healthcare service provider worldwide, dedicated to helping our clients improve their clinical, scientific and commercial results. The first step was to combine the companies' capital structures. At the end of the third quarter and concurrent to the closing of the merger, we executed a new term loan facility along with U.S. and Eurobond offerings for the combined company at attractive rates. We now have a flexible capital structure with QuintilesIMS gross leverage ratio of 3.7 times adjusted EBITDA, and we also have a cash balance in excess of $1.5 billion. This capital structure gives us ample capacity to pursue acquisitions and to repurchase shares. Our new board has approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2017. This $1.5 billion authorization represents about 8% of our market cap. As you know, share repurchases have been the preferred method of returning capital to shareholders at both Quintiles and IMS Health legacy companies, and we are pleased that this authorization provides us with a flexibility to continue this capital allocation strategy over the next year. The second area I want to highlight is the work we are doing to combine our operations. Integration teams are executing on their pre-merger integration plans. Teams from both client-facing and the functional areas are working together to implement best practices and drive process efficiencies. These integration teams have identified additional cost synergy opportunities, and as a result, I am pleased to announce, we are doubling our cost synergy target, raising it from $100 million run rate annual savings to $200 million run rate annual savings exiting 2019. Now that the merger has closed, we will be reporting three new business segments starting in the fourth quarter. The new segments are: Commercial Solutions, Research & Development Solutions, and Integrated Engagement Services. Mike, our new CFO, will discuss these segments along with our new financial metrics for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in more detail later on the call. Finally, some color on the business development side. It's been just a few weeks, but we have already begun the work needed to productionize our next-generation CRO. Our R&D Solutions team will leverage our full range of Information assets to enhance clinical trial service offerings. The team is working hard to bring this solution to market and accelerate site identification and patient recruitment for projects that are already in our backlog. We will continue to drive this offering and we'll provide updates on our progress in the coming quarters. I must add, clients are very excited and can't wait to work with us. You will recall the IMS and Quintiles teams had already begun working together to the real-world collaboration before the merger. This collaboration continues to gain traction in the marketplace with a truly differentiated offering. In fact, we won three significant multi-year deals with top 10 pharma clients within the first month of closing the merger on the back of our combined capabilities and joint offering. On the commercial tech and apps side for those who followed IMS before, I wanted to highlight a very significant competitive win with the top 25 pharma client for Nexxus MI, Mobile Intelligence, our life science CRM platform, along with a critical win with the same client for OneKey, our HCP database. Now, I'll provide you with a brief review of our third quarter financials, and remember the merger closed on October 3; therefore, Q3 results discussed on this call will be for IMS Health and for Quintiles on a separate standalone basis. The third quarter financial metrics I'll be discussing on the same legacy metrics each company provided guidance on previously. IMS third quarter revenue grew 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. At constant currency, revenue growth was 6.8%, adjusted EBITDA 5%. Quintiles' service revenue grew 3.9%; adjusted income from operations grew 11.2%. Constant currency, Quintiles' service revenue growth was 3.6%, including 8.6% in Product Development. Let me provide more color on the IMS results. IMS Information revenue grew 2.1%, while Technology Services revenue increased 13%, with particularly strong growth in workflow analytics and also tech and apps. Turning now to profit. IMS adjusted EBITDA was $238 million for the quarter, increasing 9% reported, 5% constant. The margin contraction of constant similar to prior quarters, for those of you who've been following us before, was the result of the lower margin acquisitions that we did last year as well as the faster growth of our lower margin Technology Services offerings where we continue to invest. These adverse margin effects were partially offset, as in prior quarters, by ongoing cost reductions. IMS GAAP net income was $54 million during the quarter, growing almost 25% on a reported basis, 6.5% constant. IMS adjusted net income was $132 million, up 2.2% on a reported basis, 4.7% constant. The constant currency growth was driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher interest expense. IMS GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16 in the third quarter, up 24.8% on a reported basis, compared with $0.13 in Q3 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.39 in the third quarter, an increase of 4.9% at constant currency and 2.5% at an actual currency rate. In summary, I'm pleased to report IMS turned in another quarter of strong financial performance. Before handing it over to Tom Pike to provide color on the Quintiles' standalone third quarter results, let me walk you through changes we will be making to the way we will report net new business in the CRO business starting this quarter. After a thorough review of the operating metrics that are most relevant to managing our business and the metrics that have traditionally been used in this industry, we've decided to make these changes. First, we will report a backlog metric for the R&D Solutions segment only, which is essentially the previous Product Development segment excluding some consulting type services. R&D Solutions is a long cycle business where contracts can run for multiple years, whereas our commercial businesses, including consulting as well as CSO, are shorter cycle where backlog metrics are not as relevant. Second, we've decided to report our new business and backlog metrics on an as-contracted basis, meaning, that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or executive contract. The traditional industry practice has been to report backlog based on non-binding written awards. This practice relies on a certain level of judgment and in fact may be inconsistently applied across industry participants. We believe the as-contracted approach is a more conservative and more precise approach as it requires a higher threshold and less judgment for inclusion in the backlog. The as-contracted approach will provide you, our analysts and our investors, with a simpler and clearer view of actual bookings. Also, we believe internally, this approach will help us drive greater operational discipline and accountability, and ultimately, better sales performance. Third, we will begin reporting net new business on a trailing 12-month basis. We believe net new business should not be viewed in a 90-day box as it can be somewhat lumpy, and as a result of cancellations or large awards that may fall in or out of a particular quarter, when in fact the revenue from these awards will be recognized over more than a year or sometimes a period of years. We believe this will eliminate over time excess short-term focus on the long-term metric. We will also, of course, continue to highlight expected backlog conversion by disclosing the portion of our contracted backlog that is expected to convert to revenue in the next 12 months. As the market leader, we're taking this initiative to begin moving the CRO industry to metrics that better reflect the economics of the business. We want to move to this more conservative and more informative approach, because we believe this is the right thing to do for the long run. With that, let me turn it over to Tom Pike to provide color on the Quintiles' standalone third quarter financial results.
Thomas H. Pike - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Ari, and good morning to everyone. As you heard from Ari, we're off to a strong start with integration and I'm encouraged by how well teams from Quintiles and IMS are working together. We've had many discussions with customers since announcing the merger and it is clear that our clients are seeing the value of this powerful combination. I will now walk you through the Quintiles' standalone third quarter results. Overall, Quintiles delivered 3.6% service revenue growth at constant currency, with Product Development growth of 8.6% in constant currency. At actual rates, our overall revenue growth was 3.9%, with Product Development growth of 7.9%. The solid growth in Product Development was offset by a decline in Integrated Healthcare Services primarily due to an expected decrease in our more lumpy CSO business. The Real World Late Phase business in the IHS segment continues to grow nicely. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 6.4% to $1 per share with GAAP EPS of $0.82 per share. We delivered improved margins on a constant currency basis in Product Development, which Mike will discuss in more detail. These results were strong for the quarter. Now, let's look at our new business development activity, and I remind you that I'll be talking about Production Development without advisory services. For the legacy Product Development segment, bookings, which I remind you, is now only contracted net new business was about $4.5 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in ended contracted backlog of about $9.5 billion. The third quarter awarded net new business was softer than usual. Our pipeline this quarter had a higher proportion of emerging biopharma clients and decision timing could be more difficult to predict. Separately, contracted net new business was impacted by a significant project cancellation toward the end of the quarter, resulting from a reprioritization of one client's pipeline. This cancellation was not due to Quintiles' performance on the study and we remain a committed partner with this client. Also bear in mind, since this was not one of the best quarters for new business awards, you should expect as-contracted net new business to be correspondingly impacted in the next few quarters. From a big picture perspective, it's important to note that we continue to see strong demand in the market and we currently have a robust R&D Solutions pipeline that should help drive the level of new business activity consistent with what you've seen from us over the long run. Our strategic partnerships are performing well and we are winning new business when that work is outsourced. There can be some cyclicality with these relationships as opportunities can ebb and flow from quarter to quarter with individual clients, however, the underlying relationships and trends remain solid. To reiterate, we continue to have a strong opportunity pipeline and have not changed our outlook on the market. Even more importantly, we're confident that we can capture an increasing share of market opportunities as we bring the benefits of the next-generation CRO to existing and new clients. Now, let me hand over the call to Mike, who will walk you through the Quintiles' standalone financial results in more detail.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the Quintiles' standalone results. As Tom noted, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, overall service revenues grew 3.6% in constant currency compared to the same quarter last year. On a reported basis, service revenues grew 3.9% to $1.14 billion in the quarter. During the third quarter, GAAP income from operations was $167.8 million. Adjusted income from operations was $199 million, up 11.2% compared to last year. The adjusted income from operations margin was 17.5%, expanding 110 basis points versus last year, including a 70-basis-point benefit from favorable currency fluctuations. For the third quarter, SG&A was $233.6 million, or 20.6% of service revenues, compared to $231.4 million, or 21.2% of service revenues, in the prior year. During the third quarter, we've recognized $28 million of impairment losses in our Encore reporting unit. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $200,000 in the third quarter compared to $5.4 million in the same period last year, with the decline primarily due to gains last year from our investment in the NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $4.8 million in the third quarter primarily due to the 40% minority interest in Q2 Solutions, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million in the same period last year. Reported GAAP net income attributable to Quintiles was $99 million in the third quarter, representing a decline of 10.9% compared to the same period last year, and adjusted net income grew 2.5% to $120.6 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 GAAP net income was affected by the $28 million impairment charge in the Encore business. Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 6.4% to $1 per share in the third quarter, compared to $0.94 per share in the prior year quarter, and GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 7.9% to $0.82 per share in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $413 million and $334.9 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash flow from operations of $269 million and free cash flow of $213 million, respectively, for the first nine months of 2015. Let's now move to the two reporting segments. Product Development's constant currency revenue grew 8.6% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, and at actual foreign exchange rates grew 7.9% to $874.3 million. This constant currency revenue growth resulted primarily from volume related increases in core clinical services and clinical trial support services, partially offset by a decline in advisory services. Product Development's income from operations for the quarter was $206.9 million, a 14.1% increase at actual rates and a 11.7% increase at constant currency rates. The Product Development income from operations margin was 23.7% in the quarter, representing an increase of 130 basis points compared to the same period last year, including the benefit of 70 basis points of foreign exchange benefits. IHS service revenues declined 10.6% at constant currency rates in the third quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates service revenues were $262.1 million, representing a decrease of 7.5% or $21.3 million compared to the same period last year. The constant currency revenue decline resulted from decreases in North America and Europe commercial services due to cancellations in 2015 and earlier in 2016, and a decrease in Encore Health revenues, partially offset by growth in real-world and late phase research unit. IMS (sic) [IHS] income from operations for the third quarter was $22.8 million, a decrease of 5.3% at actual rates and an 18.4% decline at constant currency rates. The IHS income from operations margin was 8.7% in the quarter, an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the same period last year. This margin improvement was primarily due to the higher margins in the Real World Late Phase unit and the benefit of 90 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower margins in the former Quintiles commercial services business. Let's now briefly discuss the combined company capital structure. Ari mentioned earlier, we executed a very successful term loan offering and a U.S. and Eurobond issuance in conjunction with the merger. The combined company is now levered at 3.7 times adjusted EBITDA, a very comfortable gross leverage ratio that allows us flexibility. Our weighted average cost of debt is approximately is 4%. We feel particularly good about borrowing at an average of approximately 4%, since we had lengthened the maturity of our debt, increased our mix of fixed-rate debt, and have a good balance of USD and euro-denominated debt. As a result, we have no significant near-term maturities. Our newly upsized $1 billion revolver is undrawn as of September 30, 2016, and we have a cash balance in excess of $1.5 billion. Ari previously introduced the three new QuintilesIMS business segments. First, the Commercial Solutions segment includes substantially all of what was the IMS legacy businesses, plus the Quintiles' legacy Real World Late Phase, Payer/Provider, and Advisory businesses. Second, the Research & Development Solutions segment, which includes substantially all of what was previously the Quintiles' legacy Product Development segment. Third, the Integrated Engagement Services, which includes substantially all of what was previously the Quintiles' legacy Contract Sales Organization. Now, let's discuss the QuintilesIMS financial metrics we will provide guidance on going forward, starting with the fourth quarter, which is our first quarter as a combined company. We are providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016 on three financial metrics: revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue will be GAAP revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial metrics, and we have provided you the reconciliations from GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA and from GAAP net income to adjusted net income. We also plan to provide guidance for the quarter and the full year on subsequent earnings calls. Let me now turn to fourth quarter guidance. Our guidance for QuintilesIMS fourth quarter revenue starts from the same guidance both companies gave or implied on the second quarter earnings calls, so no change. However, as a result of the merger and as a result of foreign currency changes we have two adjustments. First, this guidance includes an estimate for a non-cash accounting adjustment arising from the merger and is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $60 million. This adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules and IMS deferred revenue which would have otherwise converted to revenue in future periods is required to be eliminated under the accounting rules. This adjustment will only impact revenue and it will be added back to adjusted EBITDA. Second, the guidance also reflects about a $20 million drag, negative drag from FX resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since IMS and Quintiles both provided guidance on their respective second quarter earnings calls at the end of July. As a result, fourth quarter QuintileIMS revenue is expected to be between $1.95 billion and $1.99 billion, from a segment perspective: Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $885 million and $900 million; Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $875 million and $895 million; Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $190 million and $195 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be between $500 million and $515 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.04 and $1.08. For our tax rates, we expect for the fourth quarter, adjusted book tax rate to be between 30% and 32%, and adjusted cash tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. It's important to note the items we exclude from adjusted net income are predominantly U.S. expenses and our tax at our higher U.S. Federal and State income tax rates in both companies' historical GAAP effective tax rate. This results in an expected fourth quarter adjusted book tax rate between 30% and 32%, due solely to these exclusions. QuintilesIMS does not expect to pay material U.S. cash taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards until the 2019 to 2020 timeframe. Now to provide you with some context on the full year, although, we were two separate companies for the first nine months of 2016, we thought it would be useful to walk you through combined 2016 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. If we take September year-to-date standalone actuals for IMS and Quintiles along with the combined QuintilesIMS fourth quarter guidance I just walked you through, this translates to full year 2016 combined revenue of approximately $7.7 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 7%, and full year 2016 combined adjusted EBITDA of about $1.9 billion, representing year-over-year growth of about 11.5%. In the appendix, we have provided this information for each of the last four quarters. In summary, we had a solid quarter. Both Quintiles and IMS profit metrics were at or above the high end of our guidance range. The merger has created a $7.7 billion revenue and approximately $1.9 billion adjusted EBITDA company, uniquely positioned to continue capitalizing on the growing outsourcing trend within pharma, across both clinical and commercial areas. Integration efforts are well underway with our cost synergy target doubled to $200 million of annual run rate savings, exiting 2019. We've recapitalized our debt structure to take advantage of low market interest rates, providing flexibility for both acquisitions and share repurchases, and have over $1.5 billion in cash post-merger. The QuintilesIMS board approved a share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion that we expect to complete by the end of 2017. Before closing, I would like to announce a couple of changes to our Investor Relations function. Todd Kasper will transition to a leadership role in our R&D Solutions sales organization, and we thank Todd for all he has done for Quintiles. Tom Kinsley, who has led IMS FP&A and Investor Relations since the IMS IPO in 2014, will provide leadership for that function until Tom retires in February 2017. At that point, I'm pleased to announce that Andrew Markwick will lead IR for the combined company. Many of you know Andrew, as he has covered IR for IMS over the last few years. Andrew will bring continuity to the new IR team and I greatly look forward to working with him and I know you will as well. With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A. Given the remaining time, we ask our participants to please limit their questions to one, in order to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead and proceed with your question.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. The first question on book-to-bill. I mean, our math is about 1.28 this quarter, which was consistent with what you've done a year ago. So, that doesn't really speak to how net wins have trended since the merger was announced. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit more anecdotally about underlying traction with clients and how we should think about B2B trending going forward, even though, you're not technically going to be bringing it up.
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, Tycho, it's Mike speaking. As we noted earlier, we're moving away from the industry traditional practice of using non-binding written confirmation, and we're only going to be utilizing as-contracted and reporting on an LTM basis. And we gave a number of reasons, the original approach that's been used by the industry is very imprecise, it's based on judgments and we think it sets a low bar and introduces volatility. And we also think it's becoming outdated and the industry has really evolved to where – from when that method was introduced, protocols are a lot more complicated, there are lot more in the way of client partnerships that are very different and services have evolved. And we think that there's been a lot of inconsistency and a lot of the industries' own analysts have commented on that, and we also share this concern and we think that moving to a contracted approach which is much more conservative, it will have less volatility. And so forth, is something that's really the right thing to do and we hope that others will follow. As Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks as it relates to the third quarter and the spirit of your question, third quarter awarded net new business was softer than usual and contracted was impacted by a significant cancellation during the quarter. And we mentioned that our LTM contracted book-to-bill was 1.29, our contracted book-to-bill for the third quarter was 0.95. And as Tom mentioned, because this was not one of our best quarters for new business awards, you should expect that contracted net new business could be correspondingly impacted in the next couple of quarters.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And if I can just ask one follow up, there has been kind of heightened sensitivity around DSO in light of some of the recent comments from some of your other peers in the CRO space. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about backlog conversation trends and DSO trends?
Michael R. McDonnell - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think, I'll make a quick comment on that cycle. I think, overall, the backlog conversation – trials are becoming more complex, I think that bodes very well for QuintilesIMS. We're well suited for more complex trials and the duration has extended out a little bit. I do think that, again, when you move to this as-contracted method, it will give much better visibility in terms of what can actually burn into revenue more quickly. And I think that, overall, we remain very focused on that metric and I think that we're well suited to continue to drive it as we move forward.
Thomas H. Pike - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: And the thing I'd add, Tycho, it's Tom, is that we're looking forward to doing now. We've been doing a lot of work with the data and technology to IMS and what we're going to do is, in 2017, we look to apply that to the backlog. So, you really have two things going. One is, you got the combination of these powerful sales team that's working together and the new service offerings that we'll have around, the next-generation CRO. But at the same time, we're going to use these tools to look at how we really drive that backlog burn. So, more to come in coming quarters.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the question guys. So, just thinking about the increase to the expected cost synergies, are there specific buckets that you guys will be willing to share as far as where you're targeting to cut costs? And I guess, along those lines, what gives you confidence in achieving that higher amount? And then related to that, taking a step back, I think there is some fear that cost cutting, particularly on the CRO side, could be disruptive on the client front. Anything you can share as far as how you're balancing cost cutting against the nature of the client relationship within the CRO model?
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. This is Ari. Thanks for your question. Look, the buckets of cost reductions are the same. We haven't invented new areas. They're the same that we've announced before. Bear in mind, these are two large organizations that are present in many countries, IMS is in 100 countries, Quintiles in 60 countries, 70 countries. But a lot of duplicate infrastructural overhead, a lot of duplicate IT systems, think about HR, back office functions, and think about IT systems all over the world, the third area is in the global delivery network. We have, I think in combination, over 12,000 people or 13,000 people situated overseas in places like India, Sri Lanka, China, places in South America and Central Europe. So, as we look at all of those, no not to mention of course the duplicate cost of corporate functions and general overhead, so – plus the real estate footprint, none of the buckets I mentioned so far you'll note, Bob, have anything to do with clients, quite the opposite. We believe that we are actually investing in client-facing resources and we must. We've taken people from both organizations and are hiring people from outside with the relevant expertise in order to beef up the next-generation CRO initiative. We are actually going to mutually enhance our approach to clients, because with both – both legacy companies had very strong relationships with, actually the more we looked at it, clients will not always the same ones. And so, that's actually mutually reinforcing. So, the answer to your question is nothing in the area of clients, quite the opposite. Clients-facing resources are all being enhanced or supplemented. It's all in the area of the cost of doing business in the back office. The reason why to the first part of your question, those costs have doubled, is simply that we did not have the luxury or the ability to go deep into the organization, the mutual organization, we were public companies and we were in the midst of regulatory filings and so on. And so, there was a limited amount of time and resources and ability frankly from legal standpoint to get into each other's organization. We have since then spent much more time and had much more visibility, and as a result, those numbers are a lot higher. So, we are confident again, because these are tangible costs and we can touch them. It will take some time, it's not easy, don't get me wrong. We said it will take three years to get there, because it's not easy to put together IT infrastructures, to put together HR systems, to decide which CFO – which of the two CFO in – I want to take a country that we're in (42:00) in Thailand is the right one. So, it will take a little bit of time. But that's – again, nothing on the client side, quite the opposite, I would say, all of this on the cost and infrastructure side.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thank you, Ari.
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Owens with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. It's actually John Kreger. A quick question. On both sides of the legacy business, I'm sure, the bulk of your client conversations are talking about the new company and the next-generation CRO. But just curious, as you talk to the clients about all the kind of price scrutiny that they're facing, particularly in the U.S., how if at all are you seeing that impact? How they're thinking about spending in their business, again, both on the sort of legacy IMS side and the legacy Quintiles side? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Well, just to follow the sequence in which you asked, I'll start with the IMS and – overall, based on my client conversation, and I'll then give it over to Tom maybe, if you want to comment. First, look, it's important to note that all the limitations on pharma pricing by governments are not new. The talk in the U.S. is – it seems to be new here, but IMS – as you know, John, that business is in 100 countries. Most countries around the world, the government is the payer and pricing is imposed, year-in, year-out, and we've learned to deal with that. There's always been pressure on pricing from a payer standpoint in fact, even in the U.S. So, there is currently more noise around pricing, in largely the politically charged period and that's always the case, the U.S. elections are coming up. But you got to bear in mind, from the IMS standpoint, IMS Information is not tied to the way pharma prices its drugs. Okay? When we price our Information offerings or analytic services or our technology, it's based on the amount of data they purchase, the more data purchased, the higher the price and vice versa. The variables in pricing includes the number of therapy areas, the frequency of delivery, the number of geographies, the level of granularity, regions, states, ZIP codes, blocks, et cetera. So, again, I know there is a lot of talk and a lot of noise, but it does not have to do with respect to IMS itself. It does not affect our business directly in terms of demand for our products and services. So now, I would say – and again, I'll let Tom speak of Quintiles – but Quintiles' R&D is the lifeblood of companies – of pharma companies and these are long-term strategies. We work with our clients, consulting with them on their portfolio and their pipeline of drugs and so on, constantly. And they are not making decisions on which drug to invest in based on pricing at the moment of discussion on pricing, of course, returns on investments and so on are considered. But if you sit back and you look at the breadth of offerings that QuintilesIMS brings to bear in these conversations, whether it's about real-world work that we do, both combining the IMS and the Quintiles' legacy capabilities, we're actually helping our clients anticipate with real pricing that we'll be able to support and justify based on real outcomes in the real-world for patients. How we can support them analytically with data, services, and technology to defend levels of pricing with payers and with government. All of those create, all those news create demand for our real-world services. So, I think that on balance, there is no impact directly on demand for our products and services, and it's actually an opportunity for our real-world work. The broader conversation when we speak to the C-suite and CEOs in pharma is, how do I preserve my margins and continue to grow my properties, even though, I've got this pressure on pricing, on the revenue side. So, that leads to conversations about how can we help our clients reduce their costs, their overall costs, not just the cost of the CRM platform or a piece of data or a clinical trial, the overall costs. And so, a lot of our conversations – and we did not expect that there would be as many of these, but the conversations with clients have evolved towards what we're now calling the total cost of ownership, which is how can we put together all of our capabilities and help our clients outsource to us more than they did in the past, in a manner that both increases the level of quality of what they get and lower the overall cost, not the individual cost, but the overall cost. Runs a little bit contrary towards the procurement organizations typically want to do, which is to parcel out business, runs a little bit contrary to the way many pharma companies, especially the large ones are organized with a lot of silos, but those conversations are taking place as we speak. Tom?
Thomas H. Pike - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: I think, Ari, you answered it very well. I'd only add three things very quickly to your last point. I think what Ari is saying is there is no company that has the vantage point to help the pharmaceutical industry that this company does. And we understand the development process, we understand the drugs in the pipeline, and we understand how they're being sold all around the world. We put these two companies together and our sales force towards other companies in the industry. When you think about it, we've got over 1,000 people out there now working with our clients to bring new services. And it's just, we had – Ari and I had the account managers get together a couple of weeks ago, 35 or so from each side, incredible power, as you look at the two organizations collaborating. And then the last point is just that in many ways, what's happening is coming our way. Ari mentioned the point about pricing and our ability to help, but you may have seen in early September, the new Commissioner of the FDA talked about the importance of real-world data together with randomized clinical trial data, and bringing those two together at the same time. Our statisticians are actually working with the regulatory authority to help bring these together. Our people are advising how to bring vigor into the medical device area from our real-world side. I mean, in many ways, this market is coming to us.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks.
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on getting the deal closed. I wanted to ask a question around, Tom, your comments about deploying the data and working on accelerating backlog. Could you talk about what ability you have or conversely what limitations you have on applying some of the approaches or methodologies with this data to already contracted backlog? Meaning, what elements of that would need to be baked into protocols and things of that sort that might influence – to what extent you could apply that data? And then the second part of the question would be, as you bring this next-gen CRO approach to clients that will be purportedly a more efficient way to deliver the product, will you bake that efficiency into your pricing to the client, i.e., more call it lower aggressive price or would you look to price competitively with the market and let that efficiency drop to your own bottom-line? Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Dave. This is Tom. I think it's a little early for all those questions. We've only just come together. But I do want to start by emphasizing that we have three powerful segments that we'll bring to the market. And it's easy to think about the CRO and maybe it's because we kept the Q, I don't know Ari, but we have three powerful segments and all of them are powered up by this merger. And so, the opportunity here is enormous. We've actually had a team that's being going around the world, looking at the data sources of IMS, the historical data sources, and I'm really pleased to report that as they've gone into detail, country by country, and we're looking especially at the top 13 countries where we recruit about 70% of our patients and the data is rich. And our leader of the Clinical Operations, our President of Clinical Operations entity has been holding counsel with the teams looking at how we can bring that forward. And what I think has really become clear to me is the ability to have a distinctive competitive advantage, because of the fact that it takes real sophistication to use the data on a country by country basis that gives you insights into medical providers, into patient availability, into how the practice of medicine takes place there. That kind of sophistication actually gives us an opportunity for even better competitive advantage. I think, at the end of the day, we are looking very specifically at how do we help with protocol development. Because as you know, the protocol amendments are one of the most costly and delaying aspects of the business. And we continue to believe that we can have a significant impact on reducing protocol amendments we can do much better site selection. And because again, nobody has ever had access to 14.7 million healthcare practitioners. Imagine a world where instead of just having an investigator database, you actually have all the spots that refer to that investigator as well and you know how to contact them. And then third, just recruiting faster. So, when we look at the existing backlog, what we're doing is we're teasing out the studies, we've actually gone through a very sophisticated exercise to look across our studies, which ones are in a stage and which ones are likely to be impacted by the data. And then as I say, it takes a sophisticated processes to do it, but our clients are extremely interested and trying to help us, help figure out how to speed things up. So, I think the reporting out of the frontlines is strong.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Dave, just – I agree with everything Tom said. With respect to the backlog, you asked how would we specifically work with the backlogs to accelerate revenues, I've got two very specific and quick examples. One is, in the industry, there is a term that I've come to learn which is rescue studies, that is studies that are going not as well as anticipated, because the ability to recruit is discovered during the trial is much lower than what was anticipated. So, these rescue trials are where the population of patients or the density of patients in the individual sites is very low. And so, we can obviously supplement with data, that effort and accelerate and help those rescue studies. Second, the complex trials that are going on. And the complex trials that may not necessarily be rescue trials, they just are going – they are typically going to be longer and it's anticipated that they will be longer, because they are very complex. And in those ones, again, we can use data to accelerate recruitment. Now, it's only that – sometimes the marginal benefit of using the data is not that great, because there are smaller studies where everyone knows where the patients are and it doesn't help very much. So therefore, with respect to the backlog itself, again, rescue studies and complex trials is where the team is looking at. And the second question on pricing, you're correct that in a sense, you should have more visibility ahead of time. In a sense, your risk – your ability to share risk is greater and we – as Tom said, it's very early days, we will be looking over time how to develop models with our clients where we can leverage that capability. Thank you, Dave, for your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: We have time for one more question?
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Yeah. We think, we've got time one more, Ari.
Ari Bousbib - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Perfect. Our final question then will come from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Hello. Good morning. This is (55:50) filling in for Derik de Bruin. Thank you for squeezing me in. There has been a lot of focus on the potential benefits that the merger will bring to the CRO business as far as backlog conversion and better patient recruitment and site selection. But I wanted to perhaps ask a question about the CSO business. And so, is – especially in light of the headwinds that the former IHS segment have been facing in commercial services, I was wondering if you could elaborate as to how perhaps the IMS legacy products, specifically the Nexxus platform in MIDAS or the OneKey reference database could be use to revitalize the CSO business?
Thomas H. Pike - Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.: Well, thank you for your question. It is a good question. We're working precisely along the lines that you're suggesting. Now, is there a way to transform this business by equipping the sales rep that are essentially contracted out to our clients with better capabilities, visibility on data and technology, so that gives us a superior advantage. The fact is, this industry is largely – it's priced based, it's cost plus and not – it's a very low margin. And so, we are going to – we are looking actively at all of the above. But this is not like this industry is going to become all of a sudden a high growth, high margin contributor. We will improve it by doing what you're suggesting, but it will be marginal improvements. I think with respect to lumpiness, hopefully, we can smooth that out by being more competitive in the marketplace. Thank you.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
Thomas Kinsley - IMS Health, Inc.: Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Andrew Markwick, Todd Kasper, Matt Fisher and I will be available live after the call for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: On behalf of Quintiles, good morning, and welcome to the Quintiles Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Lauren, and I will be your event specialist today. At the end of today's presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Todd Kasper, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kasper, the floor is yours.
Todd Kasper - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Lauren. Good morning and welcome to Quintiles' second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Operating Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2015 annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 11, 2016. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability. Please note that we will also end today's call at 8:55 AM Eastern. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. We're very pleased with our execution in the second quarter, which produced the results highlighted beginning on slide 4. Overall, we delivered 8.6% service revenue growth or 7.9% growth at constant currency rates, with Product Development accelerating to 13.2% growth or 13.1% in constant currency for the quarter. We grew diluted adjusted earnings per share by 19.2% to $0.93 per share with GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 per share, representing 6% growth. We had a very strong quarter in net new business, growing 24.4% over the prior year quarter, closing $1.64 billion of new business, translating to a company-wide book-to-bill of 1.41. In product development, we closed $1.39 billion of new business, our second largest quarter ever, driving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.56 in this segment. This performance brought our book-to-bill ratio in Product Development to 1.26 for the first half of 2016 and helped us exceed $12.5 billion of company-wide backlog as of June 30. We had strong cash flow from operations of $152.7 million in the first half of this year and repurchased $97.6 million or approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock in the second quarter. We're pleased that our industry-leading Product Development business continues to operate from a position of strength. IHS performance, given our commercial sales business, as we've told you many times, can be lumpy. I'll discuss both of these segments later in the call. Now, let me hand over to Mike, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the consolidated results on slide four. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, consolidated service revenues grew 7.9% at constant currency compared to the same prior year quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 8.6% to $1.17 billion in the quarter, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of $7 million, driven in part by strength in the Japanese yen in the quarter. For the quarter, the North America and Latin America region contributed approximately 44% of our consolidated revenues. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region contributed nearly 34%. And the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately 22% of the total consolidated revenues. The Product Development segment accounted for 76.3% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 23.7%, an over 300 basis point greater contribution from Product Development compared to the second quarter of 2015, due to stronger revenue growth in this segment, including the revenue from the businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics into Q2 Solutions. During the second quarter, GAAP income from operations was $150.7 million, and adjusted income from operations was $184.8 million, representing a decline of 4.8% on GAAP income from operations, and growth of 12.3% on adjusted income from operations, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The income from operations margin was 12.9%, representing a decrease of 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, and the adjusted income from operations margin was 15.8%, representing 50 basis points of expansion compared to the same period last year. The adjusted income from operations margin included the benefit of 130 basis points of favorable currency fluctuations. I'm going to discuss the margins by segment in some detail later. For the second quarter, SG&A was $250.6 million or 21.5% of service revenues, compared to $225.9 million or 21% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included the increased cost from Quest businesses being added into Q2 Solutions, an increase in general cooperate and unallocated expenses, primarily due to $8.9 million of expense related to the proposed merger with IMS Health, and the recording of $6.8 million in bad debt expense related to some customer accounts, which we believe to be isolated. The bad debt expense and merger-related expenses added approximately 135 basis points to our SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the quarter. The merger-related expenses have been added back for our non-GAAP reporting. We recognized $2.8 million of other income net in the second quarter compared to $11.7 million of other expense net during the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2016, this income primarily consisted of $1.6 million of foreign currency net gains. Other expense net in the second quarter of 2015 included $6.8 million of foreign currency net losses and $4.6 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to an acquisition. During the second quarter, we increased our 2016 board-approved restructuring plan by $19 million and recognized $25.1 million in net restructuring charges under our existing plans. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $4.5 million in the quarter, primarily due to profits in Q2 Solutions. Income tax expense was $36.8 million during the quarter, equating to a GAAP effective income tax rate of 27.9% compared to $31.7 million and 27.6%, respectively, for the same period last year. Reported GAAP net income attributable to Quintiles grew 2.1% to $86.8 million in the second quarter, and adjusted net income grew 14% to $112.5 million compared to the same period last year. Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 19.2% to $0.93 per share in the second quarter, compared to $0.78 per share in the prior year quarter, and GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.71 per share in the second quarter. Our cash balance was $956 million as of June 30, 2016, of which $212 million was in the U.S. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $152.7 million and $95.4 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to cash used in operations of $13.6 million and free cash flow of minus $45.5 million, respectively, for the first six months of 2015. The net cash provided by operations during the period reflects the increase in net income, as well as lower payments for income taxes and lower cash used in days sales outstanding. The lower cash used in DSO reflects an increase in DSO in the first six months of 2016 when compared to a – reflects a smaller increase in DSO in the first six months of 2016 when compared to the first six months of 2015. Capital expenditures were $57.4 million for the first six months of the year or 2.5% of service revenues compared to $31.9 million, during the same period in 2015. During the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average market price per share of $65.67 for an aggregate purchase price of $97.6 million. These repurchases were funded with cash on hand and there is approximately $46.8 million of authorization remaining under the current repurchase program. Our total debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016, was $2.45 billion. Our net debt outstanding defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at June 30, 2016 was $1.49 billion. The $1.64 billion of new business booked during the quarter including foreign exchange impact on the backlog resulted in backlog of $12.5 billion. Let's now move to the two reporting segments, beginning on slide 5. In Product Development, we booked net new business totaling $1.39 billion, representing growth of 43.2% over the same period last year and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.56 times service revenues in the quarter. This net new business comprise a favorable mix of full service clinical projects including the anticipated signing of several large cardiovascular trials and strong bookings in Q2 Solutions. Product Development's constant currency revenue grew 13.1% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, and at actual foreign exchange rates grew 13.2% to $890.1 million, including $1 million of favorable foreign exchange impact. Product Development's constant currency revenue growth benefited from volume-related increases in core clinical services and clinical trial support services, as well as the incremental impact of the business that Quest contributed to Q2 Solutions, partially offset by a decline in advisory services. Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $187 million, a 6.1% increase at actual rates and 1.7% decrease at constant currency rates. The Product Development income from operations margin was 21% in the quarter, representing a decrease of 140 basis points compared to the same period last year, net of 150 basis points of foreign exchange benefits. The Product Development income from operations margin in the second quarter of 2016 includes $4.2 million of the bad debt expense previously mentioned, and a $10.1 million reserve for certain potentially non-reimbursable expenses. This bad debt expense and reserve collectively reduced the Product Development income from operations margin in the second quarter by approximately 160 basis points, and we do not expect either to reoccur. The Product Development income from operations margin also included an increase in compensation and related expenses relative to the prior year in addition to our planned investment to expand our Global Delivery Network. In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $259.8 million representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94 times service revenues in the second quarter. IHS service revenues declined 5.9% at constant currency rates in the second quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $277 million, representing a decrease of 3.8% or $11 million compared to the same period last year including favorable foreign exchange of $6 million. The constant currency revenue decline resulted from decreases in North America commercial services due to cancellations in 2016 earlier this year, and a decrease in Encore Health revenues, partially offset by growth in the real-world and late phase research unit and an increase in Europe commercial services. Commercial services in Europe benefited by $8.9 million from the acceleration of revenue related to the modification of a royalty-based sales force arrangement. IHS income from operations for the second quarter was $25.8 million, an increase of 37.9% at actual rates and 25.4% increase at constant currency rates. The IHS income from operations margin was 9.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 280 basis points compared to the same period last year. This margin improvement was primarily due to higher margins in commercial services resulting from the modification of the royalty-based sales force arrangement just mentioned, higher margins in the real-world and late phase unit, and the benefit of 60 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations partially offset by $2.6 million of bad debt expense. Now, turning to our full 2016 – full-year guidance on slide 6. Today, we are adjusting our 2016 constant currency service revenue guidance to a range of 6% to 7% compared to the full-year 2015. This guidance is based on our expectations of achieving a constant currency service revenue growth of approximately 10% in Product Development in 2016, which is consistent with our prior guidance, and lower expectations for the IHS segment, where we expect constant currency service revenues to decline by approximately 3% to 6% in 2016 driven by project cancellations and scope reductions incurred and lower-than-expected additions to new business this year to-date in our commercial services business. We are increasing our expectations of a diluted adjusted earnings per share to between $3.78 and $3.88 per share representing growth of 13.5% to 16.5% with GAAP earnings per share to a range of between $3.26 to $3.41, representing growth of 5.7% to 10.6% compared to 2015. Our annual earnings per share guidance reflects the anticipated strength of our Product Development margins for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect the annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%. This financial guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of June remain in effect for the remainder of the year and does not reflect the potential impact of any future equity repurchases or the announced merger agreement with IMS Health. Diluted GAAP EPS guidance includes certain merger-related costs, including actual costs already incurred and estimates of certain future costs. Actual results may differ from these estimates. And now as we transition to slide 7, I will turn the call back to, Tom.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Mike. Product Development business is the crown jewel of Quintiles and the team really performed this quarter from a sales and business development standpoint through operations across that entire segment of the business. We are particularly pleased with the net new business, which is attractive work as well. As you know, Product Development is the industry leader with strong therapeutic and scientific expertise, global scale and award-winning technology. We grew those revenues by over 13%, which included a contribution from our lab joint venture with Quest, as well as strong growth in the other Product Development service lines. The market backdrop for this segment remained strong, with now over 5,400 new drug candidates in the Phase I to Phase III pipeline, a number that continues to grow on a quarterly sequential basis. Biotech funding are down from the historic highs a year ago, still remained solid and is at or above historical averages. There is some nice discussions about this by this industry's analysts. And there were 14 NME approvals by the FDA in the first half of 2016, which is on pace with the same point last year. In all, we remain positive on the market backdrop of Product Development and our pipeline of opportunities continues at attractive levels. As we've discussed, we continue to make investments to leverage the scale we have in operations. These include our professionally managed industry-leading Global Delivery Network, which allows us to deliver many processes in a more industrialized way with higher or better quality at lower costs. We're also investing in process improvement and technology upgrades for our people. I do want to note that we had a number of items impacting the operating margin in the segment this quarter that we don't expect to repeat. The strong top line and operating performance allows us to continue to deliver for shareholders while we make investments. Moving to IHS, you'll recall that since the IPO, we've said many times that the commercial business is lumpy. We grew that business in 2014 and 2015 and now the business is performing similar to 2013 when we went public. Most recently and moving forward through the year, the CSO business has been impacted from the previously discussed cancellations in 2015 as well as 2016 cancellations and scope reductions without finding shorter-term replacement business. While there were many drug approvals last year, the particular products and companies haven't resulted in much incremental demand for CSO in this calendar year. Interestingly, we do see some good activity in that business, but it really hasn't played into new business or revenues yet. For instance, I continue to have discussions with top executives regarding leveraging a variable commercial sales workforce. The pharmaceutical industry is still looking for better, more cost-effective solutions for dealing with the changing commercial, healthcare and payer landscape. Also in the IHS segment is real-world late phase, which continues to have an attractive pipeline of opportunities and double-digit growth. As we've discussed before, we expect to about triple this business since we bought Outcome Sciences in 2011, but it cannot make up for the larger CSO business. As Mike mentioned, we recorded the benefit from modification of royalty-based agreement in the quarter resulting in higher IHS margins. However, as indicated in our guidance, you should not expect a full turnaround in commercial this year. It's important to note that the IHS segment comprises about 10% of our segment operating income in any given period. In addition, we manage expenses in that segment very tightly to ramp up and down as needed. In closing out my remarks in the quarter, let me note a few other things. We were again named to the Fortune 500, having moved up 29 places compared to last year, our third straight year on the list. We were recognized by ISR reports as the industry leader in Phase I, II, III and IV services. We opened a technology Solution Design Studio, where expert teams will collaborate to create technology solutions to tackle some of healthcare's biggest challenges using advanced technology and simulation. And in addition, we announced our Precision Enrollment offering. This new enrollment model is designed to significantly accelerate site start-up and patient recruitment in oncology clinical trials, working with the company's network of investigative sites across the U.S. and leveraging secondary data. Over the past several weeks, we've spoken with many analysts and investors about the announced plan to merge with IMS. I'm not going to speak about it here in my prepared remarks, but I will share that we are as excited about it now as we were when we announced it. I'm pleased that our deep bench of strong management can both work together on planning while continuing to deliver strong operating performance. I've said many times that this company has the best management in the industry and, frankly, best people overall. As I travel around the world I'm so proud of our people, from top to bottom. This quarter demonstrated that strength, and I'd like to thank all of Quintiles for their contributions. Now, let me turn it back to Todd to begin the question-and-answer session.
Todd Kasper - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Tom. We are now ready to take your questions. I would like to ask our participants to please limit their questions to one to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions. Lauren, you may now open the call for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, gentlemen. So, I'd be curious, given I'm sure there was a lot of customer outreach over the last quarter, it seems like in a number of your top customers there's a lot of excitement about the potential of your combination with IMS. Can you just share a little bit of some of the conversations maybe you've had and some of the key areas where you feel like folks are most intrigued by the potential of the combination?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Ross. It's Tom. Why don't I go ahead and take that one? Yeah. As you know, I meet with a lot of customers at various levels, and we continue to have tremendous feedback about what the opportunity is together. It's pretty clear that the clinical development enterprise is ripe for organizations that want to make significant improvements to it, and our ability to use big data now, really to use de-identified patient data, the significant physician database that IMS has is, being very well-received by customers. And it ranges from discussions about setting expectations well with the regulatory authorities about how many patients there are and where the patients are, all the way to making trials much more predictable in terms of really moving from a traditional analog way of calling physicians to see if they have patients to understanding the patient population while you're designing the protocol and while you're starting the site development process. So, I'll tell you, it's been uniformly good, interestingly, even on the commercial side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. I think people find it very intriguing about how we have a number of very operational capabilities associated with areas like the CSO or certainly real-world in particular, and they bring – they have so much data and analytical horsepower at IMS. And so, organizations – we're having some very intriguing discussions about how we can work together to improve the commercialization of products. So, I'd say so far, Ross, uniformly, it's been terrific discussions, and we continue – because we're already doing it in the real-world sector, we continue to work with certain key clients on case studies and opportunities to leverage the data.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Thanks, and maybe just quickly for Mike, just to clean up. Could you just help us understand the updated guidance for the remainder of the year, the benefit to op income from FX? Because I noticed the constant currency growth was a little bit lower for the overall business than I would have expected given the top line, but you did get a nice benefit from currency. Just help us think through how that's playing through the P&L the rest of the year?
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. That's fair, Ross. The updated guidance assumes essentially two high-level things, one is that we don't repurchase any more shares and the second is that the June rates, the June foreign currency rates that are in effect as of the end of June, would stay in effect throughout the remainder of the year. So, there's no currency prediction that would be embedded in the guidance. And obviously, if the U.S. dollar continues to be strong, there could be positive impacts, and vice versa.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, Derik. Are you there?
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Sorry. Hey, the booking at the PDEV operating margin for the quarter, you're down $290 million (27:09), I realize $160 million of that was some onetime items. But can you talk about your expectations on margin expansion in that segment for the remainder of the year?
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I mean, I can touch on that, Derik, and then, Tom or Kevin may want to add. But I think overall that the key point here is that we've increased our earnings per share guidance, at the same time, maintaining Product Development revenue and taking IHS down. So, overall, you've got an updated revenue profile that's actually overall a bit weaker. It's 6% to 7% versus the 7% to 8.5% and yet EPS was coming up and I think that that really reflects our views on our ability to get our margins to the right spot and then, start to expand them in the second half. We talked about the 160 basis points from the bad debt and the reserve that we booked but it's important to note that we also did have increased compensation cost in the mix and then, importantly, investments in our Global Delivery Network that we've been talking about making and those were heavier in the second quarter. And so, as we come through those items then move into the third and fourth quarter, we factored into our guidance and we think, the increase in EPS reflects the fact that we feel confident that we can expand our margins.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: And I'd say – Tom – from my standpoint, I just – I am really pleased with the operating performance of Product Development. I mean, really that 13% revenue growth and then given these onetime items, it's really strong operating performance and we expected that folks will see what's going on there, very much as Mike described. So, I couldn't be more pleased with how that Product Development team performed this quarter.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just one quick follow-up if I can. On the IHS business, is the – is it really just because the new business opportunities are slow or is it more competitive pressure? I mean, you do have a rather large competitor in that end-market. So, can you just talk about sort of why competitive dynamics in that market?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. This is Tom. I was looking through some of the data around this and over the last couple of weeks. And interestingly, we're seeing about the same number of opportunities but the opportunities, we haven't had the chunkier opportunities and chunkier wins this quarter or really this year. Usually, that business has somewhat of a sawtooth pattern to it. If you look at it in terms of every other quarter, we have a strong quarter. This time, we didn't have the sawtooth pattern, we just had two flat teeth and I think the – I think what you're seeing is actually a fair volume, but we're not having the chunkier transactions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: I wanted to just follow-up quickly on Derik's question there. Tom, you're sort of talking about lack of chunkier deals. Is there any pricing, so I'll call it lack of discipline in the commercial services market today?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Kevin, do you want to add some comments on commercial?
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Operating Officer: Sure. I would just – Dave, before getting to your comment, I think maybe go back to Derik's question a moment ago and the reference to the competitive nature. And I think it's important to note when you look at the competitive landscape, there is not a competitive risk position globally that we are from a commercial perspective. So, when we look at the competitive landscape and you reference a larger competitor, I think that might be isolated by region and from the markets that we're participating on and we tend to be the larger, if not the largest player in the market. So, there isn't really any one competitor, I would say, on a global basis that has the breadth and depth that we do from a commercial offering perspective. So, I think that's one important thing to note. Dave, with respect to your question, I think, it's been a competitive market forever, really. So, we compete pretty heavily. I think the discipline in the market still remains strong. I think Tom's prepared remarks really talked about the discussions that we continue to have at very high levels of our customer base around opportunities of lowering costs than variablizing their cost structure. So, I think, those opportunities still remain in front of us. They vary a little bit potentially by region, but certainly, the opportunity we still see in that business to turn it back to a growth business.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: And if I could follow up just sticking with that, I know commercial services are overwhelmingly the largest part of the IHS revenue. Real-world late phase has been an area that you've talked glowingly about in the past. Can you help us understand, is the softer bookings environment there kind of – disproportionately low commercial services bookings offset by positive booking, kind of positive north of 1.0 book-to-bill in real-world late phase which is what we would expect, I think.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Operating Officer: You are absolutely on the mark, Dave, and in fact, if you look at the Product Development book-to-bill in the quarter, you can assume that the real-world late phase book-to-bill in the quarter was very similar to the Product Development. So, in many senses, some of those bookings track very much in line with the clinical side of the business and that is a very good growth opportunity.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: In fact, the first half bookings were better than Product Development's, so...
Operator: We now have Jon Groberg from UBS.
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks a million. So, I guess, my question is around bookings in PDEV. I know last quarter you highlighted that a number of bookings spilled over into the second quarter. Just kind of – if all of those materialize as you thought and whether there was anything unique in the second quarter in terms of how bookings trended, are there any pull forward or anything from the third quarter? And then, could you also just give us the organic growth or how much Quest contributed in the quarter? Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: This is Tom. I'll start on the first one. Yeah, I have to say I'm really pleased with how our business development team and the sales team, and Product Development in particular, and real world performed this quarter. It's not easy to put these sales in a 90-day box. That probably pleases the folks who look at the industry. And the team really did a great job of making sure that we closed the business that was in front of us and it happened to be a little bit lumpier in the end of this quarter. But there is nothing in particular that's pulled forward from future quarters. As we've mentioned in some venues, we actually had quite a strong pipeline this quarter and we converged on it. Now, as we go forward, we continue to see strength in the pipeline in Product Development. So, as we've probably said over the last 10 quarters that the pipeline has been pretty consistently large. And so, we still feel comfortable that this segment continue to perform but we're really pleased with the execution. And I will say, that the work, the type of work that we won ranging across the variety of our services is very attractive work and with very attractive customers. So, I couldn't be more pleased with the Product Development performance associated with the book-to-bill and the overall sales. And then, the second...
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, the second part of your question, Jon, I can comment on quickly why we don't get into specifics beyond the segment book-to-bill. What I can say is that the bookings in Q2 in the second quarter were particularly strong.
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Tom, can you just give us an update on the status of the timing of IMS transaction? And also, any updated thoughts around the synergies figures that you provided when you announced it?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Rick, I can't really get into any of that here – I don't know. And I think our expectation associated with the close is fourth quarter, I can get that far. But I don't really want to get too far into the particulars of the synergies or transactions on this call, Ricky, if that's all right..
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. So, maybe if you can give us some more color on source of revenue growth in bookings by customer segment. And obviously, you talked about what you're seeing on the biotech side. But are you seeing any – the changes in the behavior or are there any delays in starts coming out of biotech or anything that could be perceived as changes from how their behavior has changed from signed contracts to trial starts?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Not really. Not for us. I think we – we're still very comfortable associated with that the dynamics of the industry are consistent with what it's been before. We're not discussing issues of backlog burn or timing or any of that. So, we're, I think from our standpoint the general profile of the work looks the same, and as you can imagine with some of these larger trials, we expect that now, of course, they'll have a startup period that takes a while but they'll be very attractive work for us over the longer period of time. I will say that what we probably are seeing is a little bit like the industry. If you look at the industry leaders, they will tell you now that between the relationships they have, the investments they have that they are being – there's an increasing number of products that are actually coming out of the emerging biotech segment as a percentage of the overall products. And we are certainly seeing opportunities grow associated with the biotechs. So, it still represents a relatively small amount of our backlog compared to many of our peers and compared to our history, but it is – but we're definitely seeing a lot of activity associated with the emerging companies and smaller companies.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ricky.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Mike, can you just elaborate a bit on some of the unusual items that you called out in your prepared remarks? I think you mentioned bad debt charges and a reserve taken in both segments. Maybe what drove that? Should we view that as some rework on your end or maybe a little bit of a lower balance sheet among your clients? And similarly the conversion in – I think you called it a royalty-based sales contract within IHS, is that a pure EBIT benefit? And will anything like that carry into the second half? Thanks.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So, John, I'll tackle the last one first. The royalty acceleration is a one-off item and it does drop straight to the bottom and is not something that would carry through. There's a very small piece of it that will carry through. It's not terribly material. So, the bulk of it is all second quarter. It all drops to the bottom. And really, it's just a longer-term royalty arrangement that we just agreed to take a lump sum and accelerate, a pretty simple transaction. As far as the balance sheet items, a couple of thoughts, one is, on the bad debts, historically, as you know, Quintiles has had very, very low bad debt expense and very limited bad debt experience. And I think what we had in the quarter was really just a few one-off items. And I would describe them as purely transactional and not in any way systemic. It's not something that we are overly concerned about. And we just had a few spots with some smaller customers that we felt it was prudent to take reserves. And we'll obviously continue to pursue collection for work performed. But it was just a few miscellaneous accounts that obviously added up to a much larger number than what we're used to seeing. But I would just reiterate, it's not something that we see as a trend at this point. And then, the reserve, we have lots and lots of costs that we run through, both pass-throughs as well as other contractual costs. And in this particular case, we decided that it was prudent to book a reserve for some costs that we may incur that may not ultimately be reimbursable by customers and something that we may or may not be able to pass-through. So, we took a – what we think is a prudent approach to book a reserve for the costs and not book any corresponding revenue, and obviously, something that we'll monitor going forward. But I can confidently say that both the bad debt expenses, as well as the reserve that we booked, were something that we consider to be isolated.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans at Wells Fargo.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. When you were discussing the book-to-bill, I believe you used some language there where you said that these were anticipated cardiovascular signings. I was just curious there, how confident you are that those will be signed, and what exactly the trigger was to go ahead and put those in backlog?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think that was – probably I didn't speak properly on it. What it really – we were talking about between quarter one and quarter two. So, there was some dialogue that we had had that we had some signings that we had hoped to be in quarter one. We'd anticipated they'd be in quarter one, but they actually occurred in quarter two. So, from our standpoint, those are sales at this point. Tim, I do want to say, and Kevin may have a comment here, too, that I think that 1.56 book-to-bill, though, really was a strong performance by our team and just represents – you're so pleased when you talk about the strength of your pipeline, and then you deliver against that pipeline. I think Quintiles just has access to opportunities, just an unparalleled opportunity set. And our ability to execute against that with our competitive advantages is tremendous. And so, I couldn't be more pleased with that as we – from that first quarter.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, just to add to Tom's comment, I think it was exactly the right way to explain this. We had the expectation that those would be signed in the second quarter. And they were signed in the second quarter. They have been awarded to us. And as you know, Tim, we don't put anything into backlog that doesn't come with an official award from a customer. So, the strength of that new business and the quality of that new business is very good.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And really quickly, I think you called out some weakness in the Encore business. Is that new – is that effectively what is the new item kind of causing the reduction in the IHS guidance? And I guess, why is that Encore business weakening?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: It's not enough to impact the guidance. So, the guidance change you see really is because of the CSO business, that lumpy CSO business. So, in the Encore business, I think the way I'd put it, Tim, is it's still finding its footing here. It has a number of items in it that can be transactional, and a number of long-term client relationship items, and it's still finding its footing. And so, on a relative basis, though, it's pretty immaterial here in terms of its overall size.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan from Avondale.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Hey. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Sorry to kind of beat this over the head here. But I just want to make sure I understand. So, the Product Development operating margin, reported 21%; constant dollar, 19.5%. But then, add back 160 basis points for some of the nonrecurring items, so we're back to 21.1%. And then, Mike, you said there was a bit higher compensation expense and there was also obviously the impact from the investments in the Mumbai, India facility. So, what would be kind of the – I guess the core operating margin? Would it be maybe 21.5%, somewhere in that area? And then – the reason why I'm just kind of hawking on this is just because I want to kind of understand. I think that – the assumption is that margins will remain about at the core level throughout the rest of the year, maybe even a little bit better. And that's what's been incorporated in this slightly higher guidance. If you could just help me out, that'd be great.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: You're thinking about it right, Greg.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Okay.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: I think that the core level with slight lift has been baked into the guidance going forward. And I think obviously it gets a little judgmental in terms of what you single out. But overall, the margins, if you pull out those one-offs and then those – the comp and the Mumbai, and you kind of normalize it, it's a solid margin that's equal to or better than last year and then ability to expand, as reflected in our guidance, as you said.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Great. And then, just real quickly on – just kind of housekeeping. So, if I think about Product Development revenue growth this quarter, I mean I was kind of assuming Q2 was around about a 3% contribution year-on-year. Maybe it's a little bit less. But then, you had mentioned, Mike, about some lower advisory services work in the quarter. So, I guess if I net those two out, was it about flat? Do they – did they cancel – did those two cancel each other out? Or how did that work?
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I would say that the Q2 impact to the good is probably a bit more than the advisory impact in the bad, when you net the two out. So, I wouldn't say they quite net the breakeven. But directionally, that's – what you're saying is logical.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: It was so strong outside of Q2 which contributed very well and had a strong book-to-bill as previously described. I mean it was strong operating performance, though, from core clinical and then related services. So, we're really pleased with that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the question. I'll just ask, one, get us back on track with the one question each. Yes, the strong Product Development revenue obviously helped by a better conversion rate. Was there anything specific that you were able to do in the quarter as far as the back – to accelerate the backlog conversion rate? And if I look at the back half guidance, it does seem to call for maybe that to decelerate again, just to get to the full year revenue number. Just any more detail you could share with us on backlog conversion in the quarter and how you're thinking about it for the rest of the year would be helpful.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: So, we've mentioned a couple of times in prior calls that we have been working very hard to accelerate backlog where we could. And so, our team – I have to say that team who works around core clinical is doing a really good job of managing the details, trying to increase the speed of patient recruiting, and managing of the details of that business over the last several quarters. And so, what I think you saw was just really great performance on that front in terms of us managing and driving performance. Now, you'll see some programs I announced and said in my prepared remarks, our pursuit of an enrollment offering and things. So, what we keep doing is trying to use our prime sites and use new techniques, like the precision enrollment, which actually lets us reduce the amount of time, the administrative time associated with starting up sites in oncology to try to continue to speed things up. But I think in general, what you just saw was a team really managing well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. A lot of the questions have been answered. But maybe I'll ask one. Glaxo has started their RA trial in the Apple ResearchKit. And kind of given what you've done with Apple, how do you view this as impacting CROs? And can you maybe just talk about your own efforts around the real-time outcome data announced?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, this is Tom. It's going to take a while I think. Now, the challenge with all this is that the devices have to be validated by the FDA. And they really have to be consistent. And many of the consumer devices – in fact, it's – to be able to prove if they're consistent for – to the level of specificity that we need for this industry and the level of repeatability is a challenge. Interestingly, we're doing some work, including out of our Novella subsidiary. Novella actually does a fair amount of work around medical device. You may recall the acquisition we made. And we're doing some work in helping some of the device companies, and very – we can't talk about it specifically, but device companies that are – that you know, we are helping them try to figure out how to make sure those devices are validated and really can be used in trials. We are experimenting with it though. And if you come to our Solution Design center that I mentioned some time, we can show you a whole series of technologies that we're using that range from in-home hubs to wearable devices that we think over the longer term will impact the industry.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker from KeyBanc.
Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask you, going back to the contract sales organization, when you think about the sales and marketing budgets of a lot of your clients and kind of where they're spending money to market new product, are they generally moving away from sort of on-site detailing more towards digital and Internet channels? Is there like a structural pressure on that business that maybe you could elaborate on or not?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Interestingly, I think our general view is the product still need to be detailed at this point in time. And what we see in our business, we have a combination of sales reps. And then, at times, the products are more complex and they need more of a nurse educator to potentially participate or a medical science liaison to explain. And so, what we're really seeing is the continued need for explanation, but more sophisticated ways of thinking that detailing. That being said, there's no question that multichannel is a big part of this. And we continue to explore ways to communicate with docs. And it varies a lot around the world. How do you communicate with docs in a way that's efficient, and as they're getting more and more comfortable with mechanisms other than face to face? So, we don't see any particular fall-off. I think a little bit of is the ebb and flow of the current sales reps that people have on board, what they think their pipeline is like, how – whether they have real blockbusters or products that are a little different, the emergence of specialty. So, you have a lot going on there. And what we're trying to do is continue to transition our company to be able to – for instance, we're doing a lot more around specialty in that area. We're doing a lot more and starting to think about how do use the IMS data to guide sales force choices, because of the access that we have. So, it's a lot of interesting activity. But we just haven't had the chunky CSO sales that we've been able to show a lot of quarters since we went public.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell at R. W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick ones here. First off, on the comments on foreign currency in the guidance, Great British pound, euro, both ended June almost exactly where they are today, that in your prepared comments, I – or in the Q&A, I thought you suggested that at current rates, there might be some upside in the guidance. So, I'm little unclear on that one, if we could start there.
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Eric. It's Mike. So, we assume in the guidance that the end of June rates hold constant throughout the rest of the year. And obviously, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. But we basically assume that wherever we were at the end of June that we hold constant through the remainder of 2016, and we don't try to predict that. And small movements aren't going to create huge impacts. It's really more of the impacts like we saw in 2015, where we had significant movements in the dollar against the other currencies.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Eric, is that it?
Michael R. McDonnell - Chief Financial Officer: Great. Well. Yeah. Thank you for joining this morning's call and we look forward to speaking with you soon. And turn it back to Tom to...
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think you said it. Thanks to all of you and thanks for your support. Operator?
Operator: Thank you again for joining us today. This concludes today's Web conference and you may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: On behalf of Quintiles, good morning, and welcome to the Quintiles First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Dana, and I will be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions].
 It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Todd Kasper, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kasper, the floor is yours. 
Todd Kasper: Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Operating Officer. 
 In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors. 
 Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 11, 2016.
 In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. 
 I would like to point out that, as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability.
 I would now like to turn over the call to our CEO, Tom Pike. 
Tom Pike: Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings call. 
 As you've heard this morning, we are excited to have entered into a definitive merger agreement combined with IMS Health in all-stock merger equals transaction to create an industry-leading information and technology-enabled Healthcare Services provider. We're excited about the announcement, and we will focus our comments on this call on Quintiles' first quarter results. Having already hosted one call this morning, we'll be shortening this call to about 45 minutes. 
 Now let's jump right to Slide 3 with some of the highlights from the first quarter. We delivered 8.4% constant currency service revenue growth, with product developmental accelerating to 12.6% growth in constant currency for the quarter, and we grew diluted adjusted earnings per share by 23.6% to $0.89 per share. Our $1.03 billion of net new business resulted in company-wide book to bill of 0.93x, which included a 0.95x book to bill in product development and 0.84x book to bill in IHS. Now regarding new business, let me share right up front that we had decisions on several large opportunities slipped into the second quarter. 
 During April, we obtained awards resulting in stronger than usual net new business. In fact, it was the largest dollar volume of new business awarded in Product Development in the first month of any quarter since we went public 3 years ago. Entering the second quarter, even reducing for the strong April awards, we had the largest ever dollar value pipeline in Product Development. 
 And we also had very strong cash flow in the first quarter of the year, with $112.1 million of cash flow from operations and $86 million of free cash flow. In all, our important Product Development business is performing well with a strong pipeline. Our IHS business is strategically important but continues to be a little lumpy and contribute a little less to the bottom line. 
 Now let me hand the call over to Mike, who will walk you through the financial results in more detail. 
Michael McDonnell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 
 Let's begin with the consolidated results on Slide 4. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, consolidated service revenues grew 8.4% at constant currency compared to the prior year quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 7.6% to $1.11 billion in the quarter, net of an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $8.1 million. For the quarter, the North America and Latin America region contributed approximately 45% of our consolidated revenues. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region contributed nearly 33% and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately 22% of total consolidated revenues. 
 The Product Development segment accounted for 75.6% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 24.4%, a 280 basis point greater contribution from Product Development compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to stronger revenue growth in this segment, including the revenue from the businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics into Q² Solutions. 
 During the first quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 22.5% to $181.9 million, a margin of 16.4% with 200 basis points of margin expansion. This expansion was comprised of 60 basis points due to revenue mix shift as a result of faster revenue growth in Product Development and further leverage of our cost structure, with the remainder resulting from favorable currency fluctuations. 
 For the first quarter, SG&A was $225.5 million, or 20.4% of service revenues compared to $219.6 million, or 21.3% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included the increased cost from Q² Solutions, and increase compensation-related costs, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange. 
 We recognized $4.5 million of other expense, net, in the first quarter compared to $2.9 million of other income net during the same period last year. 
 In the first quarter of 2016, this primarily consisted of $4.2 million of foreign currency net losses. We recognized $3.1 million in net restructuring charges during the first quarter in connection with previously approved and announced plans. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2.4 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the 40% minority interest in Q² Solutions. 
 Income tax expense was $42.6 million during the quarter, equating to a GAAP effective income tax rate of 28.6% compared to $36.1 million and 29.7%, respectively, for the same period last year. 
 Adjusted net income in the first quarter grew 18.7% to $108.3 million compared to the same period last year. Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 23.6% to $0.89 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.72 per share in the prior year quarter. 
 Our cash balance was $1.05 billion as of March 31, 2016, of which $228 million was in the U.S. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $112 million and $86 million, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The net cash provided by operations during the period reflects the increase in net income as well as lower payments for interest and income taxes, and a 1-day improvement in days sales outstanding in the first 3 months of 2016.
 Capital expenditures were $26.2 million for the quarter or 2.4% of service revenues compared to $16.4 million during the same period in 2015. 
 Our total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2016, was $2.46 billion. Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents, at March 31, 2016, was $1.4 billion compared to $1.49 billion at the end of December 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the higher cash balance. 
 The $1.03 billion of new business booked during the quarter, net of foreign exchange impact on the backlog, resulted in backlog of $12 billion. Let's now move to the 2 reporting segments, beginning on Slide 5. 
 In Product Development, we booked net new business totaling $799 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95x service revenues in the quarter. 
 Product Development's constant currency revenue grew 12.6% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, and at actual foreign exchange rates, grew 11.7% to $837.5 million, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Product Development's constant currency revenue growth benefited from volume-related increases in core clinical services and clinical trials support services as well as the incremental impact of the business that Quest contributed to Q² Solutions. 
 Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $189.3 million, a 20.6% increase at actual rates and 12.1% increase at constant currency rates. The Product Development income from operations margin was 22.6% in the quarter, an improvement of 170 basis points compared to the same period last year. This margin improvement included 180 basis points of foreign exchange benefits offset by an increase in compensation and related expenses as well as our continued investment in the growth of our Global Delivery Network, including the opening of a new facility in Mumbai, India. We continue to -- we intend to continue investing in growth through the second quarter, adding and training people both in Mumbai and our clinical development organization as a whole. 
 In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $227 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.84x service revenues in the first quarter. IHS service revenues declined 3.1% at constant currency rates in the first quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $270.5 million, representing a decrease of 3.5% or $10 million compared to the same period last year, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.2 million. As expected, IHS constant currency revenue growth started the year slowly as a result of cancellations in commercial services during 2015 as well as lower new business additions in Japan. This constant currency service revenue decrease was offset by growth in the real-world and late phase research unit. 
 IHS income from operations for the first quarter was $17.9 million, a decrease of 1.1% at actual rates and a 6.5% decrease at constant currency rates. The IHS income from operations margin was 6.6% in the quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. This margin improvement included higher margins in the real-world and late phase unit, and a benefit of 40 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations, offset by lower margins in commercial services in North America and Japan and advisory services. 
 Now turning to our 2016 full year guidance. Today, we are reaffirming that our 2016 constant currency service revenue growth guidance remains in the range of 7% to 8.5% compared to the full year of 2015. We are also reaffirming our expectations of diluted adjusted earnings per share of between $3.70 and $3.85 per share, representing growth of 11.1% to 15.6% and diluted GAAP earnings per share of between $3.52 to $3.70 per share. We continue to expect the annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%. 
 This financial guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of March remain in effect for the remainder of the year, and does not reflect the potential impact of any future equity repurchases. I will now turn the call back to Tom. 
Tom Pike: Thank you, Mike. Our Product Development segment remains the CRO industry leader. It is our crown jewel. Our therapeutic and scientific expertise, technology and global reach are the envy of our industry. Our reputation is such that small companies want to work with us, help lend credibility to their efforts. Including midsized and small, we now have over 10 sole-source relationships. 
 We executed well on revenue and income from operations in Product Development in the first quarter. We're having a success with our revenue acceleration programs. We are pleased with our 12.6% constant currency revenue growth, and that we've maintained margins while absorbing some cost increases for key roles and a normal beginning of the year resets for employee taxes and benefits. And we are pleased with the cash flow, which is above our seasonal norms for the first quarter. 
 In terms of backdrop for that segment, the Product Development segment, there are now over 5,300 compounds in Phase I to III clinical research, up sequentially again. Our pipeline is the largest in overall dollar amounts, opportunities entering a quarter that we have seen. It's increased sequentially for the fourth quarter in a row. It contains a nice mixture of large and small opportunities and large and small companies. We're also having strong performance in Asia, given our years of investment there. After all, we do have the backlog of $12 billion to burn. 
 We have the best sales team in the business. However, the timing of decisions, especially large ones, is up to our customers. As I mentioned, several of our larger opportunities across both segments slipped out of the first quarter. In Product Development, we had strong bookings in April as you've seen and importantly, we're holding our full year guidance and earnings guidance for revenue and earnings. 
 Moving to IHS, our commercial business continues to be hampered by the lumpy bookings from last year, and now this quarter. Traditionally, Q4 is a strong quarter for the business and Q1 is often weaker. With 45 approvals of new medicines last year in the U.S., U.S. outlook is the strongest of our regions. Our commercial team continues to make progress with customer relationships to take advantage of those approvals. With the complex therapies, injectables and fusion products, et cetera, we are starting to see more interest in providing nurses and clinical trial educators to both the research and development and commercial customers. Although a bit less consistent, the commercial business is valuable for the completeness of our offerings. 
 Perhaps more important is our real-world, late phase business. This continues to grow against the strong market backdrop. In this segment, due to the orientation of the medical affairs customer and other customers outside of R&D, we continued to see a market and business that's growing in double digits. Real-world data is critical to both challenges across of R&D and working with payers. Our epidemiologists are industry-leading. Leveraging our real-world late phase business, this quarter we announced an innovative deal with the American College of Surgeons to continue our relationship and build them instead of sophisticated and comprehensive registries with feeds from over 1,800 hospitals. We are leveraging the skills of our Encore acquisition here as well. This will allow a sophisticated analysis of real-world practices, with potential of improving the practice of medicine not only in surgery but in key therapeutic areas, which the college gets involved. This is the kind of thing that we can do in the back of our sophisticated technology, medical and epidemiological skills.
 In closing, I would like to thank and recognize the entire Quintiles' team for their hard work, commitment and execution in the start of 2016. Once again, this hard work distinguish Quintiles as a world-class leading company, proud to be named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies, one of Forbes' Best Employers in America, Ethisphere Institutes World's Most Ethical Companies and the Best Hero in Asia at the BioPharma Asia Industry Awards. And finally, by being recognized by HR.com with leadership excellence awards. 
 I will now turn it back over to Todd to begin the question-and-answer. 
Todd Kasper: Thank you, Tom. We are now ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] You may now open the call for questions, please. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Jones: Tom, I know this call is about the quarter, but the previous call obviously ran long with all the details that you guys provided on the transaction. So if it's all right, I want to go back to that. I think the synergistic opportunities might not be as obvious to some just given that this transaction is somewhat unprecedented. So I guess the real question for me is just thinking about the revenue synergies, is this more from selling into areas, where either one or both of you already have a strong presence? Or is this actually coming up with new and innovative solutions and products that your pharma clients currently don't have access to today? 
Tom Pike: Robert, it's actually, primarily, leveraging the businesses that both of us have today and being more effective in them. If you think about our business, overall, and you think about that Product Development pipeline that I spoke about for instance, it's the largest one that we've had since we've been public. And not only that, but actually, it's perhaps the largest one that we've had ever, but we just don't have statistics from back over all of the years associated with it. But I would expect that it probably is the largest one we've ever had. And interestingly, the quality of what's in there is very attractive full service work. So if you think about bringing a differentiated competitive advantage about how we can find and recruit patients, one that we can demonstrate to customers in an RFP process or for talking about partnerships and even in trials where other CROs are primary providers but we can demonstrate the fact that we can get to investigators and the patients in a differentiated way, I think it's incredibly powerful combination. So for me, I think when you start with that with the CRO and then you look at the opportunity in the industry, it's fantastic. And then you start moving across the real world, both organizations having a very fast-growing business units. We've put together very complementary capabilities. We literally wrote the book on comparative effectiveness and they are, as Ari says, the Big Data company, the original Big Data company in this space and then powering up both of our commercial solutions given the relationships, I think it's very powerful. So interestingly, we don't even have to do much to our solution except power them up with each other's capabilities to really drive the benefits. Does that help, Robert? 
Robert Jones: No, no, that does. That definitely does. And I guess just -- since this is the Q1 call, just one in the quarter, bookings were weak across both segments. You mentioned some very large awards being pushed into April. I'm just curious, is that from both segments, or was that really from Product Development? And then any sense at all you can give us on the size of those deals just so we can maybe get some context around what 1Q might have looked like had those deals not slipped out, that would be really helpful. 
Tom Pike: Yes. Bob, it actually was both segments. So my lawyer -- nobody wants me to make excuses about Easter or conferences or things like that, that happened to fall toward the end so I won't make those excuses, Bob. But the reality was that both -- we had some very large transactions that needed board approval before they went forward, and really it's been a very strong April in terms of closing out those opportunities. As we described, it's certainly our best April since going public and again, we don't have all the data on it. But it's our best April for many, many years, if not, ever. So that would be indicative. As you might know in our business, the first month of the quarter is actually not traditionally, the strongest month of the quarter. So I think we feel very good about the ability to close out the opportunities we had on the first quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian from Citigroup. 
Garen Sarafian: Just following on the same thing of the prior question, regarding the first call, the merger IMS. You guys mentioned higher win rates a few times as a major value creator. So could you give us a little bit more context around that? So just to the extent you could quantify, what are the average win rates that you're sort of discussing for the industry? What are you envisioning those win rates could be, again, using averages if you can't get to specifics? So just give us a little more confidence as to what you're trying to describe. 
Tom Pike: We don't disclose our win rates in particular, Garen, but let me just give you a couple of general statistics. The industry sees at least $20 billion of RFP-related opportunities and in general, across it and the industry being the CRO industry. And then in addition to that, you may know that we've really led the way with sole-source relationships that others don't see as part of the industry. I think if you think about those few things, the ability -- if you can move the win rate just a few percent, it creates a pretty significant bottom line impact. And then in addition, our ability to really be a great partner for more pharmaceutical firms we think is enhanced. And so it's very interesting. I mentioned on the other call about, if you look at the assets that they have, which are quite unique, in particular because there are many claims and other databases around the United States that can be used. But what IMS Health has is assets around rest of the world, and this is where I've mentioned that about -- in areas where about 85% of our patients are recruited, they have data. If you look across their physician database, which they maintain regularly, they actually have a group who regularly calls physicians to make sure information is updated, et cetera. That identifies physicians that are clinical investigators, and we already have the largest database in our industry that will be significantly enhanced. So if you start thinking about some of these advantages, Garen, and if we execute well and like when you run a business, it's always about execution. If we execute well and both organizations are known for strong execution, we should really be able to drive those higher win rates both through a combination of partnerships and then in general, just in terms of the RFP flow. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI. 
Luke Sergott: This is Luke in for Ross. I guess just keeping with the RFP activity scene, if you guys could just comment on potential levels that you're seeing among your small biotechs versus the large customers, especially since a couple of competitors have talked about a little slowdown in RFP activity among the larger clients, given they're focusing on their priorities that are going on right now? 
Tom Pike: We -- Ross, we haven't given Kevin an opportunity to chat yet. So Kevin, do you want to take that one? 
Kevin Gordon: Yes, Luke. Clearly with the pipeline that Tom described, not only the opportunities that we see in the volume, the dollar volume of opportunities that you've heard us comment over the quarters about the strong mix of business that we've had really across the spectrum or the size range of our customer base, and that's really no different as we look at this quarter. So whether it's small, midsize or large, I think the comment was even somewhere in the prepared remarks here that the pipeline remains strong in all those areas. We continue to have opportunities and even the biotech area, which I'm sure is somewhat the genesis of your question, actually some pretty good strength there. So we feel very good about the size of the pipeline, the breadth and the diversity of the customers that are included in that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. 
David Windley: So many things to ask, hard to pick just one. I will focus on real-world evidence or real-world late phase as you guys have called it. It seems, Tom, that that is a pretty significant focus of value creation in the deal. I know you haven't spoken specifically to size but what I'm interested in is some framing of size of real-world late phase for Quintiles, maybe if you could expound on that as to what it would look like when you combine the companies. And then you mentioned that it's growing double digits but Product Development is also growing double digits. So double digit is certainly good, but I would have expected given the opportunity that real-world late phase would be growing significantly faster than that, and how do you think about the contributors of IMS to accelerating that growth rate? 
Tom Pike: Let me start for those who don't look at it as much as we do. This whole area of real-world evidence or real-world late phase is huge and growing need for the business because the cost of collecting primary data are just getting too great and then at the same time, we are actually collecting more and more secondary data, and it ranges from everything from electronic health records to genomic data, so the data sets are becoming broader and broader. And essentially over some period of time, we're going to be able to monitor safety signals and reduce the cost of clinical development and then improve the value-based models by really powering them up with this real-world evidence. This is extremely strategic for the industry, and I think a company like ours, we've always been a company that's been able to see around the corners and for us being the first one with this kind of enormous data asset and the ability to drive value out of it is really key. In terms of the businesses itself, what we have disclosed to you guys is that since we bought Outcome Sciences in 2011, we've already tripled the business. And at this point, it is growing significantly faster than Product Development, so that's a good take but we don't disclose that number. I think what we'd like to do is do a little bit more work together with IMS Health, and we can give you a little bit more shape of the 2 businesses together over the coming months. We have to give you something, Dave, to look forward. And we don't want to give it all to you today. We want to give you something to look forward too so. But I think what you'll see is 2 businesses that are similar size, that essentially are a scaled business when put together that combine a combination of secondary data with great technology and primary data with great epidemiology, great relationships and it will be the clear industry leader as it comes together. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan from Avondale Partners. 
Gregory Bolan: I think I get it. The deal makes sense to me what for -- whatever that's for. I am getting questions though about your comments earlier with regards to reduced agency cost. Totally understand the vendor fees that you have to pay in a rapid way to respond to an RFP can be very costly, I get that. It sounds like the alliance had already been kind of running pretty strong. The questions that I'm getting from investors is why not just kind of expand that alliance, maybe make it a more intimate relationship above and beyond what it was than actually kind of going through and I guess, getting hitched, if you will. Tom, could you maybe talk a little bit about that, please? 
Tom Pike: Yes. And so agency costs [ph], my old economics term really referring to that in any company or any combination of companies, there are some costs just to the transactions of people working together contracting on things. Imagine that we see -- I talked earlier about the volume of RFPs that we see. It's in the billions of dollars and imagine if we had to go and contract for data, every time we had an RFP for slightly different indication, different geography, different protocol and we had to try to contract for that and then serve up that data and analyze it. The analogy, I've actually made internally is associated with your GPS system. If you think about it, if you had to -- every time you got in your car, you had to go and figure out where you were going to go, download the map, load it into your car, you'd hardly ever use your GPS system. But with the technology that IMS Health is creating, that literally puts the data in the cloud and makes it accessible to basically kind of a push button accessible for opportunities, it's powerful. The other thing that we get to do is our world-class medical experts are going to become intimate with that data in terms of what's available, how it works, which will provide us a really unique competitive advantage. Now why not just do this arm's length and why do they want to do this? One of the things that Ari and I have done learned together is their strategy is very much not just to provide data, arm's length, but actually provide solutions and capture the economic returns associated with the solutions. And so I don't think their preference is to just sell the data. It's actually to capture all of the value associated with the services that are provided around clinical research. So and again whether that's real-world, whether that's commercialization, what we're doing is extremely in line with the IMS Health strategy and their strategy would be, to capture economic value out of delivering the result rather than just providing the data. So I think it's a great match. It would be -- it's going to be very difficult to replicate this arm's length. 
Gregory Bolan: No, that's great. And obviously, great for patients. Congrats. 
Tom Pike: Well, I'll tell you that is the best part to be honest with you because we've all got to get this health care complex faster and more effective for patients, especially with some of the therapies. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. 
John Kreger: Tom, I think one of the other value creation discussions was this sort of smart hero concept. So can you just maybe dig into that a little bit more? I know we've heard you guys talk about your ability to kind of hit some of those key client pain points like site selection, patient enrollment and trial design. But it sounds like some of the same concepts were hit to justify the combinations. So maybe just go back. What does an IMS give you that enhances your ability to basically offer a more efficient trial process to clients? 
Tom Pike: Yes. Let me use an example and then we can go back through, and I'd welcome Kevin if he wants to add some things to this, too. I think you all know and Infosario Design today. Many of you know, so we've created the industry-leading software tools. It's actually installed in a couple of customers to look at feasibility to be able to use electronic health records and other data to understand where patients and investigators are. If you look at that tool today, unfortunately -- it's the best of its kind by the way in our industry -- but unfortunately, it operates primarily on U.S. data. So we've announced some of the data partnerships that we've had today, and they're in the tens of millions of electronic health records. Imagine powering that up with 0.5 billion electronic health records from around the world and the incremental value that we could provide. So you take something like that, they actually have tools on feasibility. We have tools on feasibility today. We can enhance each other's feasibility tools. So those are the kinds of benefits that we see. So essentially, again, it's primarily around really designing more effective trials, which reduces protocol amendments and speeds up the process for the customers, and then it's executing them more effectively and doing more effective feasibility. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: Since I avoided the last call, I might ask a 2 part here. First of all, does the 1Q book to bill as well as the ongoing IHS weakness push your annual guidance to more of a 2-way tramp? And as a follow-on to that, I'd like to hear a little bit more about what the drivers of the poor IHS bookings were in the quarter? It wasn't as clear to me that it was simply slippage. What does that pipeline look like, and what are your new expectations for growth in IHS for the year? 
Michael McDonnell: Yes. I'll start, Eric. It's Mike McDonnell. I think that it's fair to say that it's a bit of Q2 ramp. You have to remember that we had a lot of growth in IHS in the first half of 2015, and so the comparisons are bit more difficult in the first half of 2016 in that business. Product Development on the other hand goes the other way because we have the Q² joint venture not in the results for comparative purposes in the first half of '16. That will go the other way in the second half. So it's a bit of a mix, but I think your comments bear [ph] importantly, we did reaffirm the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. I think as it relates to the pipeline overall, as Tom mentioned, the question about April being the strongest month and whether that was both Product Development and IHS, it was both, as we talked about. And obviously, the product development side is the largest side of the house, at 75% plus of revenue base. But overall, the April month was strong on both fronts. And I think overall, we're pleased with where we sit at this point in the year. 
Tom Pike: Want to add something, Kevin? 
Kevin Gordon: Yes, Dave I would just add, on the revenue side, exactly what Mike described. I think you heard in the remarks, we talked about opening a new facility in India, investment in bringing people on board there and in their clinical business as well. So from a bottom-line standpoint, I would expect the same second half better than the first. 
Eric Coldwell: And do you have a full year growth adjustment in IHS? Is there some kind of an update we can get on what you're thinking for real growth in that business for the calendar year? 
Michael McDonnell: Yes, I think that when you look at IHS, again, we talked about in the beginning of the year, being a much lower growth engine than Product Development obviously. I think that's something that we expect and has started to play out. And I think overall, the trajectory overall, reasonably flat but you have to obviously remember that the margins are extremely low and what really drives our profitability and EPS is much more on the Product Development side. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Evans: In this -- if I come back to the deal for a second. In this revenue synergies or revenue growth acceleration target that you have in the out-year, I'm trying to figure what's that relative to? So what baseline are we measuring that against? Is it your own long-term 7% to 8% target range? Is it kind of what you've been growing recently on a constant dollar organic growth basis? Is it some combination of the 2 companies' recent growth rates? Just help me understand what to measure that target against? 
Michael McDonnell: Yes. So I think you're talking about the companies on a combined basis, right, and the 1% to 2%. So I mean, I think overall, when you look at all the opportunities that we see out there and the ability to do things like increasing win rates and more holistic solutions that we can offer on a combined basis, we feel very confident that overall, I think the way to think about it is that, it's 1% to 2% incremental over and above what either company could have achieved on its own. So when you model it out, you should get to a run rate ultimately, that on a combined basis if you thought it was going to be x to y. When you put those synergies in, it would be x to y plus 1% to 2%. 
Timothy Evans: Okay. So -- and I guess, the second part of the question I wanted to ask was what is the opportunity here that you'd like to go after beyond the traditional pharma customer base? In other words, you've talked in the past about going more after the payer provider set, and this could potentially position you to do that a little bit more aggressively, but how important was that element to this deal? 
Tom Pike: And I think -- Tom I'll speak to that. Interestingly, both of us have somewhat similar size entity that pursues the payer provider market. And both of us believe that our skills are transferable into that marketplace. So if you take in our case, this really, deep knowledge that we have of therapies, medical knowledge and science that we believe that that can help with care pathways' effective use of drugs adherence. Now, there's a lot of value. We actually get a lot of positive feedback from providers and others that that's possible. And I think very similarly IMS Health is assembling assets that increasingly are valuable into the payer and provider realm. So essentially, that was not a major factor in terms of doing the deal, but it is a longer-term opportunity for growth for both companies that is outside of the industry, the pharmaceutical industry. 
Todd Kasper: Okay. So I think with that, as Tom mentioned at the call, we are going to keep today's call to 45 minutes, given 2 calls and to not monopolize everyone's time this morning. So thank you for your time. Thank you for the questions, and we will look forward to speaking with everyone soon. Have a great day. 
Tom Pike: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you again for joining us. This concludes the webcast and you may now disconnect.
